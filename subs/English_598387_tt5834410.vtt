1
00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:49.677
Look who's finally awake.

2
00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.780
Just in time
for your first fireworks.


3
00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:58.019
Aren't they beautiful?

4
00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:01.355
Just like you, my sweet bun.

5
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.360
Hmm?

6
00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:07.695
That's odd.

7
00:01:10.698 --> 00:01:12.567
Oh, no. They found us.

8
00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:17.438
Baby, hang on to your Binky.

9
00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:19.640
Grandma's got this.

11
00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:27.749
Look at the silly <i>yaoguai.</i>

12
00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:29.283
Bye-bye, dolly!

13
00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:33.588
"Bye-bye" is right.

14
00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:38.025
Don't worry, Tom.
Help is on the way.

There you go.
Nothing to worry about, see?


25
00:02:12.226 --> 00:02:14.061
Come on. Come on.

26
00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:15.530
Where are you?

27
00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.272
Excuse me. Watch out.
Coming through.


28
00:02:24.338 --> 00:02:26.808
Make way for
the Pork Chop Express!


29
00:02:26.874 --> 00:02:28.976
Who says pigs can't fly?

30
00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:39.287
Look who finally decided
to show up.


31
00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:43.257
Clear the path, Goat.

32
00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:46.561
Let's go. You know the drill,
Zodiac. Protect the Guardian.


33
00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:48.462
Attack!

34

Eat feathers, <i>yaoguai!</i>

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.332
Kick and kick and kick.

36
00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.167
Cute attack!

37
00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:01.943
Horse, round them up.

38
00:03:07.415 --> 00:03:09.951
Ooh, that's not good.

39
00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:15.756
Mrs. Lee!

40
00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:18.893
Tiger, no!
Wait for us!

next time, loser.


45
00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.604
Maybe you can watch
where you're walking, winner.


46
00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.340
I guess not.

47
00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:07.642
You okay?

48
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.378
Yeah, I'm great.

49
00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:12.113
Hey. You're the new girl.

50
00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:14.916
Been a girl for a while now.

51
00:04:14.982 --> 00:04:17.652
I'm Tom.
Okay, I'll be right back.


52
00:04:17.718 --> 00:04:20.488
You are so dead.

53
00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:24.258
Not just mostly dead,
but actually, like,
a hundred percent dead?


54
00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:25.726
He's not worth it, man.

55
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.662
Run away, freak!

56
00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:29.664
This is a walk,
not a run.


57
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.165
Anyone ever see his house?

58
00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:33.434
The whole place is covered
with this junk.


59
00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:35.369
Magic charms and incense.

60
00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.071
It's his crazy grandma's.

61
00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:38.906
What is she,
some kind of witch?


62
00:04:38.973 --> 00:04:42.643
Okay, for real, can we leave
my grandma out of this?


63
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.111
Or what?

64
00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:48.849
Say, "My grandma's
a crazy witch."


65
00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:51.185
Your grandma's a crazy witch?

66
00:04:51.252 --> 00:04:54.355
Wait. No, no, no! Your--

67
00:04:54.422 --> 00:04:58.059
This is what you get.
You and your witchy grandma.


68
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:02.129
I told you,
leave my grandma out of it!


69
00:05:04.632 --> 00:05:05.666
You see that?

70
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.140
You can see his underwear.

71
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.926
What is happening?

72
00:05:33.627 --> 00:05:35.396
Yo! Fight Club!

73
00:05:36.564 --> 00:05:37.865
It's okay. It's just me.

74
00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:40.868
Yeah. Well,
you snuck up on me.


75
00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:42.303
I'm Rav.

76
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.537
I'm Tom.

77
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:45.106
Yeah, you mentioned
that earlier,


78
00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:48.009
right before you threw a dude
into the ceiling. Hello?


79
00:05:48.075 --> 00:05:51.712
You know,
maybe it's that protein bar
I had this morning.


80
00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.714
Wow. I gotta
get one of those.


81
00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:56.550
Oh.

82
00:05:56.617 --> 00:05:58.219
Wait for me?
Okay.


83
00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.990
Hi.

84
00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:06.560
I told her I'd walk home.

85
00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:10.064
Let's go. Come on.

86
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:11.265
Got you.

91

So your grandma makes these?

92
00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:25.613
Uh-huh.
Wow.


93
00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:28.049
My foster mom,
she loves these things.


94
00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:31.752
My grandma's actually
got a whole story about how
they ward off evil spirits.


95
00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.954
Okay, stop right there.
Evil spirits?


96
00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:35.623
Sorry!
Coming through!


97
00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.626
You know how grandmas always
tell the craziest stories.


98
00:06:38.692 --> 00:06:40.594
Yeah, actually, I don't.

99
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:43.864
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...
It's all good.


100
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:45.699
I finally hit
the foster jackpot.


101
00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:48.436
The place I'm at now
is pretty rad.


102
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.237
That's cool.

103
00:06:50.304 --> 00:06:53.307
My grandma took me in
when I was super little.


104
00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:54.642
But she's great.

105
00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:58.012
You know, she can be--
What?
Weird and embarrassing?


106
00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:00.214
Yeah. But she's cool too.

107
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:03.417
I'd go live
with a cool witch any day.


108
00:07:04.518 --> 00:07:06.787
Do I have something in my teeth?

109
00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:08.622
Nope. You're good.

110
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:10.191
How 'bout now?

111
00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:16.597
Hey, Gigi.

112
00:07:16.664 --> 00:07:19.633
Ooh, is that thing okay?
Should she look like that?


113
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.570
Yeah, yeah. She just, you know,
sleeps with her eyes open.


114
00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:24.171
Bye, Gigi!

115
00:07:24.238 --> 00:07:26.474
Your eyes must be so dry, dog.

116
00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:31.445
Please just turn back now.

117
00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:33.380
Once you see it,
you can't unsee it.


118
00:07:33.447 --> 00:07:36.383
Oh, come on, Tom.
I'm sure it's fine.
Uh-huh.


119
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.153
People beat me up because
of my totally normal house.


120
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.122
It can't be that bad.

121
00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.258
Oh, dang.

122
00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:46.393
A lot of people
leave oranges on our stoop


123
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.762
because they think
our house is a temple.


124
00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:51.332
But on the plus side,
free oranges.


125
00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:54.101
Hey, Tommy!

126
00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:57.471
Hey! Who's your friend?
She looks so cute.


127
00:07:57.538 --> 00:07:59.874
Oh. Hi, Tom's grandma.

128
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:01.609
Kill me now.

129
00:08:01.675 --> 00:08:03.410
Ah Tom,
you should invite her in.


130
00:08:03.477 --> 00:08:05.980
All right.
I'll be right there, Ah Ma!


131
00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:09.216
I'll see you tomorrow.

132
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:23.797
You know, your parents met
in high school.


133
00:08:23.864 --> 00:08:25.166
Ah Ma, chill.

134
00:08:25.232 --> 00:08:27.101
She's just a friend, okay?

135
00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:29.937
She probably got scared off
anyway by our crazy house.


136
00:08:30.004 --> 00:08:31.639
Crazy amazing?

137
00:08:31.705 --> 00:08:34.508
At least
she didn't see the inside.


138
00:08:34.575 --> 00:08:38.512
Tom, even if these charms
seem silly to you,


139
00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:40.581
they are important to me.

140
00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:42.783
I still don't even know
what they mean.


141
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.919
You don't have to know
to understand.


142
00:08:44.985 --> 00:08:46.620
Ah Ma, you're talking
to me in riddles.


143
00:08:46.687 --> 00:08:48.022
One day,

144
00:08:48.088 --> 00:08:51.659
you will see yourself
for what you truly are


145
00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:53.694
and not what you appear to be.

146
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:55.596
And what does that mean?

147
00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:00.034
We talked about this.

148
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.938
Ah Tom, we don't use these.

149
00:09:04.004 --> 00:09:06.941
We use this and this.

150
00:09:07.007 --> 00:09:09.143
We don't have to fight.

151
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.979
Besides, you're not
too good at it.


152
00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:13.714
The kid called you a witch.

153
00:09:13.781 --> 00:09:15.849
So? Maybe I am a witch.

154
00:09:15.916 --> 00:09:17.985
Ha-ha. Very funny.

155
00:09:18.052 --> 00:09:21.622
This bully at school,
he needs your compassion.


156
00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.123
What? Why?

157
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.860
Because he himself
was probably hurt
at some point.


158
00:09:26.927 --> 00:09:29.797
People are
inherently good, Tom.


159
00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:32.032
Our family has always
believed this.


160
00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:34.368
What family?
It's just you and me.


161
00:09:34.435 --> 00:09:37.972
Your lineage goes back
a thousand generations.


162
00:09:38.038 --> 00:09:39.940
Our traditions
live on in you.


163
00:09:40.007 --> 00:09:44.011
Yeah, well, maybe we could try
being a little less traditional
for once.


164
00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:46.580
Obviously,
I'm proud of it
or whatever.


165
00:09:46.647 --> 00:09:47.681
"Or whatever"?

166
00:09:51.285 --> 00:09:52.953
I just wanna be normal.

167
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.624
Ah Tom, you are not normal.

168
00:09:57.391 --> 00:09:58.792
Great. Thanks.

169
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:04.298
Our entire family
is very not normal.


170
00:10:04.365 --> 00:10:08.669
I've been waiting to talk to you
about this for a long time.


171
00:10:10.104 --> 00:10:12.673
But first, you must
put the charms back up.


172
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.008
And then, we'll talk.

173
00:10:14.074 --> 00:10:15.943
Okay, Grandma.

174
00:10:17.044 --> 00:10:19.480
Hurry up!

175
00:10:25.386 --> 00:10:28.088
You can't just
put them up like that.


176
00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:31.492
Whoa, dude!

177
00:10:31.558 --> 00:10:33.193
There's a system.

178
00:10:34.428 --> 00:10:35.596
Who are you?

179
00:10:35.663 --> 00:10:37.865
How long were
the protective charms down?


180
00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:39.800
Like, for five minutes, okay?

181
00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:41.568
Do I know you, man?
No.


182
00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:42.770
But I know you.

183
00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:44.638
Whoa! Ew! Are you sniffing me?

184
00:10:44.705 --> 00:10:46.206
Yeah. And you reek, kid.

185
00:10:46.273 --> 00:10:48.108
No, I don't.

186
00:10:48.175 --> 00:10:50.644
Where's your grandmother?
Mrs. Lee, are you okay?


187
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:52.413
Dude. Okay.

188
00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:54.548
Keep your shoes on.
That's not rude at all.


189
00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:57.618
There we go.
So you have tracking mud
and all that stuff, okay.


190
00:10:57.685 --> 00:10:59.787
Hu!
Mei Ling.


191
00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:02.723
It's so good to see you.

192
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.826
No pinching necessary,
all right?
We spoke about this.


193
00:11:05.893 --> 00:11:09.029
Tom, this is Hu,
my old friend.


194
00:11:09.096 --> 00:11:10.397
An old friend?

195
00:11:10.464 --> 00:11:12.199
Like, what kind of friend
are we talking here?


196
00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:14.835
Platonic, hopefully.

197
00:11:14.902 --> 00:11:16.537
Ugh, there's no time
for this.


198
00:11:16.603 --> 00:11:19.340
I picked up the scent of <i>fashu</i>
at the boy's school today.


199
00:11:19.406 --> 00:11:20.240
Magic?

200
00:11:20.307 --> 00:11:22.076
I know. I felt it too.

201
00:11:22.142 --> 00:11:24.011
He stinks of it.
You could be in danger.


202
00:11:24.078 --> 00:11:25.245
Calm down.

203
00:11:25.312 --> 00:11:27.214
We were just about
to have "the talk."


204
00:11:27.281 --> 00:11:30.984
Ew. Ah Ma, no,
I don't need the talk.
I'm 15.


205
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:34.955
So the charms are down,
the kid still doesn't know
who he is,


206
00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:38.625
and none of the Zodiacs
have been following
any of my protocols.


207
00:11:38.692 --> 00:11:42.996
Tom, your fight today.
What exactly happened?


208
00:11:43.063 --> 00:11:45.532
I mean, this kid,
he got all mad at me.


209
00:11:45.599 --> 00:11:49.269
Huge guy, you know?
Shoulders all puffed out.
Kinda like you actually.


210
00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:51.071
Cut to the chase.

211
00:11:51.138 --> 00:11:54.174
It wasn't me.
This kid, he started it.


212
00:11:54.241 --> 00:11:56.276
Did you finish it?
What?


213
00:11:56.343 --> 00:11:58.078
Did anything strange happen?

214
00:11:58.145 --> 00:11:59.747
Yeah-
- No, not really.

215
00:11:59.813 --> 00:12:03.684
Other than
when I threw him
into the ceiling.


216
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.252
Oh, boy.

217
00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:06.720
Wait. Nobody saw you, right?

218
00:12:06.787 --> 00:12:10.858
No, no, not really.
Just about a hundred kids or so.


219
00:12:10.924 --> 00:12:12.826
Oh, we gotta
get out of here.


220
00:12:12.893 --> 00:12:14.928
Grandma, who is this guy?

221
00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:17.131
"This guy"?

222
00:12:17.197 --> 00:12:19.099
I'm a Warrior
of the Circle of Twelve,


223
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:21.335
sworn to protect
the Guardian of the Phoenix.


224
00:12:21.402 --> 00:12:24.138
Ah Ma, like
from the kids' stories?


225
00:12:24.204 --> 00:12:25.506
I'm a Zodiac.

226
00:12:25.572 --> 00:12:28.342
Okay. Hi.
I'm Tom, House of Lee.


227
00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:31.979
Lactose-intolerant and guardian
of a Steph Curry rookie card.


228
00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:33.046
"Kids' stories"?

229
00:12:33.113 --> 00:12:34.915
I wanted to give him time.

230
00:12:34.982 --> 00:12:36.683
Time for what?

231
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.120
Seriously? Guys! Hello!
I'm right here.


232
00:12:40.187 --> 00:12:41.789
We know, kid.
We know you're here.


233
00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:43.123
Dude, what is your problem?

234
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.359
Everybody knows you're here!

235
00:12:45.426 --> 00:12:47.528
Does anything you say
make sense?


236
00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:50.130
Everything I say makes sense.

237
00:12:50.197 --> 00:12:52.666
Something's here.

238
00:12:52.733 --> 00:12:55.302
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, earthquake!
Nope.


239
00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:56.970
Put on your shoes, Tom.

240
00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.839
How did you do that?

241
00:13:02.609 --> 00:13:03.844
Whoa.

242
00:13:04.711 --> 00:13:06.280
Ah!

243
00:13:06.346 --> 00:13:08.382
Ah Ma.
Oh, yeah!


244
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:10.217
I'll cover the front,
you get the back.


245
00:13:10.284 --> 00:13:12.319
No. This is powerful <i>fashu.</i>

246
00:13:12.386 --> 00:13:14.121
You and Tom need to go.

247
00:13:14.188 --> 00:13:15.456
What? No!

248
00:13:15.522 --> 00:13:17.825
Get him to safety.
He needs you, Hu.


249
00:13:20.127 --> 00:13:21.562
Tom. Tom, look at me.

250
00:13:21.628 --> 00:13:23.430
I promise
I'll explain everything,


251
00:13:23.497 --> 00:13:25.866
but right now
you have to go with Hu.


252
00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:27.334
I'm not leaving you.

253
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.905
Loo.
Go! Now!


254
00:13:31.972 --> 00:13:33.307
No, wait--
Go!


255
00:13:34.975 --> 00:13:36.210
Whoa!

256
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.645
Mrs. Lee.

257
00:13:40.914 --> 00:13:42.182
Loo.

258
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.985
We can make this easy.

259
00:13:45.052 --> 00:13:47.254
You know what I want, old woman.

260
00:13:47.321 --> 00:13:49.656
Then come and get it.

261
00:13:50.557 --> 00:13:51.892
Go!

262
00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:53.460
Bring me the Phoenix.

263
00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:05.305
How precious.

264
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.345
Grandma!

265
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.349
Whoa. Whoa.

266
00:14:16.383 --> 00:14:18.552
Oh, whoa! No, no, no, no, no!

267
00:14:19.586 --> 00:14:20.754
Back off!

268
00:14:26.994 --> 00:14:28.395
Huh?

269
00:14:31.431 --> 00:14:33.934
Oh, I really missed doing that.

270
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:36.103
What happened to your pants?

271
00:14:36.169 --> 00:14:38.372
Oh, great. More <i>yaoguai.</i>

272
00:14:38.438 --> 00:14:40.874
What the heck is a <i>yao--</i>

273
00:14:45.479 --> 00:14:48.682
No Zodiac Warriors
to protect you now.


274
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:50.450
Just you and me.

275
00:14:50.517 --> 00:14:55.355
Unless you prefer I start
with your darling grandson.


276
00:14:55.422 --> 00:14:57.291
Stay away from him!

277
00:15:11.405 --> 00:15:14.107
Come on! Come on!
Giddyap, tiger!


278
00:15:14.174 --> 00:15:16.443
Say that again,
and I will eat you.


279
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.780
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold on!


280
00:15:26.386 --> 00:15:29.289
No, no, no! Oh, my gosh!

281
00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:31.458
No, no, no! Get off my--

282
00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:34.595
Ow! Watch what you're kicking.

283
00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:36.396
Oh!

284
00:15:41.435 --> 00:15:43.170
Tiger! Tiger, help!

285
00:15:56.717 --> 00:15:59.987
Look at you, so fragile now.

286
00:16:00.053 --> 00:16:02.222
So old.

287
00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:04.358
Do you need a hand?

288
00:16:08.295 --> 00:16:09.863
I'll give you two!

289
00:16:23.877 --> 00:16:26.913
Right on a used diaper.
Ah Ma!


290
00:16:31.752 --> 00:16:33.020
Ah Ma!

291
00:16:33.654 --> 00:16:35.889
Ah Tom, are you okay?

292
00:16:38.659 --> 00:16:41.928
You think
I'm so easily defeated?


293
00:16:41.995 --> 00:16:43.530
I'll take that.

294
00:16:43.597 --> 00:16:45.332
No! Let her go!

295
00:16:46.066 --> 00:16:49.436
Not while I'm Guardian!

296
00:17:12.793 --> 00:17:13.827
Ah Ma.

297
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.101
What?

298
00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:23.003
What is that?

299
00:17:23.603 --> 00:17:25.105
The Ghost Cart.

300
00:17:25.172 --> 00:17:28.408
Comes to carry away the souls
of the great and the noble.


301
00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:40.554
Ah Ma!

302
00:18:06.446 --> 00:18:08.381
Come on, kid. Keep up.

303
00:18:18.358 --> 00:18:20.093
Quick, inside.

304
00:18:30.904 --> 00:18:32.839
I have to alert the others.

305
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.843
What good is that gonna do?
No. No, we need to...


306
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.513
Why are we in a junk shop?
Antique shop.


307
00:18:39.579 --> 00:18:41.047
Not junk.

308
00:18:41.114 --> 00:18:42.349
I live here.

309
00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:44.184
I've been here
watching over you.


310
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:45.752
You and those monsters--

311
00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:49.990
<i>Yaoguai.</i> Loo's creatures.
Vicious little creatures.


312
00:18:50.056 --> 00:18:53.426
They were just crazy stories
my grandma told me
when I was little.


313
00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:55.595
Well, they're not stories, okay?

314
00:18:56.229 --> 00:18:57.898
Not stories, kid.

315
00:18:58.965 --> 00:19:01.134
Your grandmother
was a Guardian, Tom.


316
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:02.435
One of the best.

317
00:19:02.502 --> 00:19:05.005
She gave her life
to protect that.


318
00:19:05.572 --> 00:19:06.606
Her necklace?

319
00:19:06.673 --> 00:19:08.308
It's the Phoenix.

320
00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:11.912
Ever since goddess Nu Kua
used the Phoenix
to create humanity,


321
00:19:11.978 --> 00:19:14.314
dark forces have been trying
to capture it.


322
00:19:14.381 --> 00:19:17.818
Whoa.
Now the duty of
protecting it is yours.


323
00:19:18.852 --> 00:19:20.353
What? That's not...

324
00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:23.857
I have to go home.
I have school tomorrow.


325
00:19:23.924 --> 00:19:26.326
And Grandma, she's...

326
00:19:26.393 --> 00:19:27.727
You can't leave, kid.

327
00:19:27.794 --> 00:19:29.563
It's my job.

328
00:19:32.632 --> 00:19:34.434
I don't even know you, man.

329
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:38.839
If you're a Zodiac Warrior,
I thought your job was
to protect Ah Ma!


330
00:19:38.905 --> 00:19:42.309
Tom--
You left her there!
You could've saved her.


331
00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:43.543
Hey.

332
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.745
I gotta get out of here.
Stop. No, no.


333
00:19:45.812 --> 00:19:47.447
You can't go-- Wait.
Get off of me!


334
00:19:47.514 --> 00:19:49.382
No, no, no.
You need to know about...


335
00:19:52.385 --> 00:19:54.421
...the exit spell
on the door.


336
00:19:55.755 --> 00:19:57.824
Mrs. Lee put you in my care.

337
00:19:57.891 --> 00:20:00.694
That makes you my apprentice.

338
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.797
There's a room upstairs.
Why don't you take it?


339
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:05.765
Fine.

340
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.735
Dumb tiger.

341
00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:21.915
This can't be happening.

342
00:20:23.884 --> 00:20:26.286
Just a junky necklace.

343
00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:33.560
Whoa!

344
00:20:33.627 --> 00:20:34.995
Come on!

345
00:21:01.955 --> 00:21:05.558
Who dares wake
the Empress Nu Kua?


346
00:21:06.226 --> 00:21:08.728
Um, Tom?

347
00:21:09.362 --> 00:21:11.898
Oh, it's you.

348
00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:14.968
You walk two worlds now--

349
00:21:15.035 --> 00:21:18.772
the mortal world
and the world of magic.


350
00:21:25.045 --> 00:21:26.146
Okay.

351
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.049
I really am losing it.

352
00:22:11.791 --> 00:22:14.060
I thought
she was gonna be okay.


353
00:22:18.932 --> 00:22:20.633
I'm sorry, kid.

354
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.548
I don't know what they put
in incense these days,


355
00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:38.818
but it really
irritates my eyes.


356
00:22:40.253 --> 00:22:41.654
Yeah.

357
00:22:43.156 --> 00:22:44.657
Yeah, me too.

358
00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:12.085
Psst. Hey. Tom?

359
00:23:12.619 --> 00:23:14.721
Tom. Kid!

360
00:23:20.994 --> 00:23:22.362
Wake up already!

361
00:23:22.429 --> 00:23:24.264
Ow. Cut your nails.

362
00:23:31.071 --> 00:23:33.907
What the heck?
Is that how you wake people up?


363
00:23:33.973 --> 00:23:36.309
Well, next time
I'll sing you a song.


364
00:23:36.376 --> 00:23:38.645
Now, come on.
Time to get to work.


365
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:41.948
Work? I don't know what
you're thinking with all
this apprentice stuff,


366
00:23:42.015 --> 00:23:45.318
but I'm not waxing cars
for you, man. Whoa.


367
00:23:46.152 --> 00:23:48.455
I know it's cool. Come on.

368
00:23:48.521 --> 00:23:51.691
I need to see
what I'm working with.


369
00:23:51.758 --> 00:23:54.060
Try to hit me.
What? For real?


370
00:23:54.127 --> 00:23:57.764
Unless you don't think
you're up for it.


371
00:23:57.831 --> 00:24:00.834
Oh, it's on, fur face!

372
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.805
You'll have to do
better than that.


373
00:24:05.872 --> 00:24:08.942
You think a <i>yaoguai</i>
is just gonna stand there
and wait for you?


374
00:24:19.686 --> 00:24:21.921
So, I can't hit you.

375
00:24:21.988 --> 00:24:24.090
Is that the big point
you're trying to make?


376
00:24:24.157 --> 00:24:27.794
No. The point is,
you're missing the point.


377
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:30.864
Exactly how many times
did you try to strike me
just now?


378
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.432
I don't know.

379
00:24:32.499 --> 00:24:33.566
Eight.

380
00:24:33.633 --> 00:24:35.001
And how many times
did you check


381
00:24:35.068 --> 00:24:37.270
to make sure that
the Phoenix was still with you?


382
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:40.006
Not once.

383
00:24:40.073 --> 00:24:42.208
That's the point
I'm trying to make.


384
00:24:43.776 --> 00:24:45.378
Rat!

385
00:24:46.446 --> 00:24:48.281
I told you to stay
out of my wallet!


386
00:24:48.348 --> 00:24:49.616
Get over here!

387
00:24:50.517 --> 00:24:52.452
No, no, no, no,
that thing's ex--


388
00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:54.854
You're gonna pay for that!

389
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:56.923
That's what you get!

390
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.224
How many years of--

391
00:24:59.559 --> 00:25:01.861
Stop stealing my stuff!

392
00:25:02.562 --> 00:25:03.796
Hi there!

393
00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:08.635
Oh, my gosh!
Did you see that? I did it!


394
00:25:08.701 --> 00:25:11.271
The thing!
I did the thing,
the bow, bow, bow!


395
00:25:11.337 --> 00:25:14.707
Don't get cocky.
That was a defensive <i>fashu.</i>


396
00:25:14.774 --> 00:25:16.409
It's reflex.

397
00:25:16.476 --> 00:25:18.178
Tom, this is Rat.

398
00:25:18.244 --> 00:25:20.613
Wait. He's a Zodiac.

399
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.781
He's like you.

400
00:25:21.848 --> 00:25:23.917
Are you trying to insult me?

401
00:25:23.983 --> 00:25:26.920
Sidney's my name.
Acquisitions is my game.


402
00:25:29.355 --> 00:25:30.857
Acquisitions?

403
00:25:30.924 --> 00:25:32.392
You're a thief.
Thief?


404
00:25:32.458 --> 00:25:34.394
You stole
my Ming dynasty sword.


405
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.564
Make sure he didn't
steal your watch.
I don't have a watch.


406
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.167
No problem.
I got a bunch. Want one?
I'll give you friend prices.


407
00:25:41.234 --> 00:25:42.735
Sidney,
what are you doing here?


408
00:25:42.802 --> 00:25:44.037
Oh.

409
00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:46.339
And we're going
with rat again. Okay.


410
00:25:46.406 --> 00:25:49.809
Hu, that's what
I came to tell you.
I saw Loo last night.


411
00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:50.843
What?

412
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.512
Sid, that's not possible.

413
00:25:52.579 --> 00:25:53.980
We saw her die.

414
00:25:54.047 --> 00:25:56.883
I was out wandering around
the old high-rent district


415
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.184
by the sea cliffs.

416
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:00.486
<i>They got
the most exquisite trash.</i>


417
00:26:00.553 --> 00:26:04.123
<i>I found a primo clam chowder
in the gutter.</i>


418
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.360
<i>And then, out of nowhere,
there's Loo!</i>


419
00:26:07.427 --> 00:26:10.063
<i>It was at this
abandoned mansion,
and I thought,</i>


420
00:26:10.129 --> 00:26:13.499
<i>"Now, is she here
for the clam chowder too?"</i>


421
00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:16.369
<i>She looked disgusting.</i>

422
00:26:16.436 --> 00:26:18.238
<i>And I don't just throw
that word around.</i>


423
00:26:18.304 --> 00:26:20.506
<i>She crawled
into this creepy fountain,</i>


424
00:26:20.573 --> 00:26:25.044
<i>and the water, Hu,
it healed her!</i>


425
00:26:25.111 --> 00:26:27.513
<i>Obviously,
I came straight here.</i>


426
00:26:29.649 --> 00:26:33.486
I know that place.
What are we waiting for?
Let's go get her.


427
00:26:33.553 --> 00:26:35.088
What? No!
Why not?


428
00:26:35.154 --> 00:26:36.923
Because you're gonna
get yourself killed.


429
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.025
Loo isn't
just another <i>yaoguai.</i>


430
00:26:39.092 --> 00:26:41.094
She's as powerful
as a Guardian.


431
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.862
She can access
the darkest magic.


432
00:26:42.929 --> 00:26:45.465
We should go to the temple
and get the rest of the Zodiacs.


433
00:26:45.531 --> 00:26:48.901
Exactly! Let's do that.
Team Zodiac assemble!


434
00:26:48.968 --> 00:26:50.336
I work better alone.

435
00:26:50.403 --> 00:26:52.572
Come on, Hu.
You know it'll
be safer for him


436
00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:54.240
with all of us together.

437
00:26:57.844 --> 00:26:59.812
Fine.
We'll go get the Zodiacs.


438
00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:01.047
Yes!

439
00:27:01.114 --> 00:27:02.682
I already regret this.

440
00:27:04.684 --> 00:27:06.319
You gotta be kidding me.
Hey.


441
00:27:06.386 --> 00:27:08.588
Got a little
new Guardian gift for ya.


442
00:27:08.655 --> 00:27:10.356
Whoops! That's not it!

443
00:27:10.423 --> 00:27:13.426
Found that on the bus,
so you know it's good.


444
00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.495
You might need this.

445
00:27:15.561 --> 00:27:19.098
Now, remember,
you didn't get this from me.


446
00:27:22.935 --> 00:27:24.570
Whoa.

447
00:27:24.637 --> 00:27:26.606
Is that Ming dynasty?

448
00:27:27.507 --> 00:27:28.708
Sweet!

449
00:27:30.243 --> 00:27:33.846
Chinatown is the most
delicious place in the world!


450
00:27:33.913 --> 00:27:36.015
Excuse me.

451
00:27:39.419 --> 00:27:40.687
Oh. Mmm.

452
00:27:40.753 --> 00:27:42.021
Do you smell that?

453
00:27:42.088 --> 00:27:44.023
Rotting fish,
splattered soy sauce.


454
00:27:46.025 --> 00:27:48.161
Rude!

455
00:27:49.829 --> 00:27:51.264
Is that moldy ginseng?

456
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:54.100
Dumplings!
Can you believe someone
threw these out?


457
00:27:54.167 --> 00:27:55.168
Come on, Rat.

458
00:27:55.234 --> 00:27:58.237
Yes!

459
00:27:59.806 --> 00:28:02.208
There it is.
Wait, we're getting dim sum?


460
00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:04.744
Not everything
is what it seems, kid.


461
00:28:08.114 --> 00:28:09.215
It's only one of them.

462
00:28:09.282 --> 00:28:10.550
I'm pretty sure
I can handle--


463
00:28:12.385 --> 00:28:15.555
Crap.
Not everything is
what it seems, right?


464
00:28:16.989 --> 00:28:18.157
Oh, yeah.

465
00:28:18.224 --> 00:28:20.393
Mess with the Tiger,
you get the claws.


466
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.528
What? That's not a thing.
Yes, it is.


467
00:28:22.595 --> 00:28:25.331
No, it isn't.
No one says that.
Tigers do.


468
00:28:31.571 --> 00:28:32.638
Whoa.

469
00:28:32.705 --> 00:28:34.173
Oh, you!

470
00:28:37.944 --> 00:28:39.545
What?

471
00:28:40.513 --> 00:28:43.049
Ah. Come on. Let's do this!

472
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.485
Show-off.

473
00:28:48.287 --> 00:28:50.156
Yeah, yeah, you can fly.

474
00:29:00.967 --> 00:29:03.169
Yo! That was incredible!

475
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:04.670
Gentlemen.

476
00:29:04.737 --> 00:29:05.905
Mistral.

477
00:29:05.972 --> 00:29:07.907
I was doing just fine
without you.


478
00:29:07.974 --> 00:29:09.275
Yes, I saw.

479
00:29:09.342 --> 00:29:10.977
It's good to see you, rodent.

480
00:29:11.043 --> 00:29:12.912
She called me "rodent."

481
00:29:12.979 --> 00:29:14.480
Thomas Lee.

482
00:29:14.547 --> 00:29:17.817
It will be my honor
to protect you and guide you.


483
00:29:17.884 --> 00:29:20.686
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Mrs. Lee entrusted him to me.


484
00:29:20.753 --> 00:29:23.689
So I'll be the one
watching over
and guiding him.


485
00:29:23.756 --> 00:29:27.693
Oh. Like you guided him
into this trap?


486
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.829
Okay, look,
I'm taking the kid
to the temple.


487
00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:31.564
Good idea.

488
00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:34.567
You can probably
find him a master there
with fewer trust issues.


489
00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:36.769
You know what?
Nobody asked you.


490
00:29:36.836 --> 00:29:38.538
Asked me what? To save you?

491
00:29:38.604 --> 00:29:41.207
You're welcome,
by the way.


492
00:29:41.274 --> 00:29:43.009
Dragon just can't
help herself, can she?


493
00:29:43.075 --> 00:29:45.978
Oh, same old Hu.

494
00:29:46.045 --> 00:29:50.016
What's the saying
about the tiger and his stripes?


495
00:29:50.082 --> 00:29:51.584
You're hysterical.

496
00:29:51.651 --> 00:29:52.685
I know.

497
00:29:56.255 --> 00:29:58.291
Hmm?
Cynthia!


498
00:29:58.357 --> 00:30:00.460
We are closed.
What?


499
00:30:00.526 --> 00:30:04.630
Ooh.
Tell me more about how
you have all this handled.


500
00:30:05.264 --> 00:30:06.866
Cynthia, it's me, Tiger.

501
00:30:06.933 --> 00:30:08.301
It's Hu.

502
00:30:08.367 --> 00:30:10.269
Open the door.

503
00:30:10.336 --> 00:30:11.938
You're embarrassing me
out here.


504
00:30:12.004 --> 00:30:13.005
Closed!

505
00:30:13.072 --> 00:30:14.407
This is Zodiac business.

506
00:30:14.474 --> 00:30:17.243
And this is
dim sum business.


507
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.913
And we open in three hours.

508
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.014
Nicely done.

509
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:23.216
Does anybody like you?

510
00:30:23.282 --> 00:30:24.951
I know how to deal with this.
Mmm.


511
00:30:25.017 --> 00:30:29.522
In exchange for entry,
I offer you this 65-year-old
wild ginseng.


512
00:30:29.589 --> 00:30:32.592
Hey, Rat,
no more stealing soy sauce.


513
00:30:32.658 --> 00:30:35.828
Are you sure
you're not confusing me
with another talking rat?


514
00:30:35.895 --> 00:30:37.497
Will a hundred bucks do?
Oh!


515
00:30:37.563 --> 00:30:39.265
We just opened! Come in.

516
00:30:39.332 --> 00:30:41.267
Not a word.
You're welcome.


517
00:30:43.135 --> 00:30:46.005
Oh, that smells so good.
Could we, like, stop
and get a char siu bao?


518
00:30:46.072 --> 00:30:47.273
Nope.
Forgive Hu.


519
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.641
He doesn't
understand humans.


520
00:30:48.708 --> 00:30:50.710
Or feelings.
Or the modern world.


521
00:30:50.776 --> 00:30:54.213
Or much of anything,
to tell you the truth.


522
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.284
Boy reeks like armpits
and new magic. Who is he?


523
00:30:58.351 --> 00:31:00.753
He's under my protection.
Our protection.


524
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.655
Zodiacs.

525
00:31:02.722 --> 00:31:04.657
Hmm, so what's
going on here?


526
00:31:04.724 --> 00:31:07.393
The Temple of the Twelve
is inside a freezer? Really?


527
00:31:28.047 --> 00:31:29.482
It's been a minute.

528
00:31:48.034 --> 00:31:50.236
Hey, thanks for the bun.

529
00:31:50.303 --> 00:31:52.838
You needed it. Too skinny!

530
00:31:55.608 --> 00:31:57.743
Oh. She's a frog.

531
00:32:00.846 --> 00:32:01.948
Whoa.

532
00:32:02.014 --> 00:32:06.285
Welcome to
the Temple of the Twelve.


533
00:32:06.352 --> 00:32:10.022
Ooh. So this is like
your magical fortress?


534
00:32:10.089 --> 00:32:12.358
You ain't
seen nothing yet.


535
00:32:17.263 --> 00:32:21.534
And now, introducing
our starting lineup.


536
00:32:21.601 --> 00:32:23.436
What are we,
a basketball team?


537
00:32:23.502 --> 00:32:25.237
Let Rat do his thing.

538
00:32:25.304 --> 00:32:27.139
Presenting the amazing,

539
00:32:27.206 --> 00:32:32.244
the astonishing Zodiac Warriors!

540
00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:37.984
First up,
here is your wake-up call
from Mr. Early Bird himself...


541
00:32:39.385 --> 00:32:40.853
...Rooster!

542
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.755
Feathers of fury!

543
00:32:42.822 --> 00:32:43.623
Whoa.

544
00:32:43.689 --> 00:32:45.725
Pawing his way into your heart,

545
00:32:45.791 --> 00:32:48.928
you gotta love him,
stinky breath and all,


546
00:32:48.995 --> 00:32:49.996
Dog!

547
00:32:50.062 --> 00:32:51.864
Slobber tsunami!

548
00:32:51.931 --> 00:32:55.568
Next is the big guy,
all muscle and tussle,


549
00:32:55.635 --> 00:32:58.304
the unstoppable Ox!

550
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:02.575
Put your opposable thumbs up
for the simian sorceress
herself: Monkey!


551
00:33:02.642 --> 00:33:04.877
The lean, mean
shrinking machine!


552
00:33:06.245 --> 00:33:11.050
She puts the pork in chop
and the belly in flop! Pig!


553
00:33:11.117 --> 00:33:12.985
The ham slam!

554
00:33:13.052 --> 00:33:17.490
Bringing the heat,
she's the maniac of pyro.


555
00:33:17.556 --> 00:33:19.925
Give it up for...
Too hot to handle.


556
00:33:19.992 --> 00:33:21.360
...Dragon!

557
00:33:22.828 --> 00:33:25.598
That's not bad, actually.
Don't encourage this.


558
00:33:25.665 --> 00:33:27.400
If you said it, she's heard it.

559
00:33:27.466 --> 00:33:30.202
The adorable Rabbit!

560
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:32.038
Cute attack!

561
00:33:32.104 --> 00:33:34.807
She's flexible, she's fanged,

562
00:33:34.874 --> 00:33:38.144
and you definitely
don't want to find her
in your sleeping bag!


563
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:39.078
Snake!

564
00:33:39.145 --> 00:33:41.480
Let's snuggle.

565
00:33:41.547 --> 00:33:45.551
The thoroughbred
of speed: Horse!


566
00:33:45.618 --> 00:33:47.953
Maximum horsepower!

567
00:33:48.721 --> 00:33:50.523
Our explosives expert,

568
00:33:50.589 --> 00:33:53.693
the "baaa" of boom...

569
00:33:56.028 --> 00:33:57.229
Goat!
Whoa.


570
00:33:57.296 --> 00:33:58.597
And he's serious,

571
00:33:58.664 --> 00:34:01.333
he's complicated,
he's selfish...


572
00:34:03.002 --> 00:34:04.804
That's it. Show's over, Rat.

573
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.572
I'm bringing them in.

574
00:34:09.208 --> 00:34:10.543
Rude.

575
00:34:13.145 --> 00:34:17.016
Huh. That's weird.
Usually there's all 12 of us.


576
00:34:17.483 --> 00:34:19.251
This is it?

577
00:34:19.318 --> 00:34:21.320
This is barely a petting zoo.

578
00:34:21.387 --> 00:34:23.656
Who's the kid?
This is Tom.


579
00:34:23.723 --> 00:34:26.125
He's the Guardian now.
Hey.


580
00:34:26.192 --> 00:34:28.494
New Guardian, huh?

581
00:34:28.561 --> 00:34:29.962
Are you pulling my feathers?

582
00:34:30.029 --> 00:34:32.932
Look at this kid.
He's barely hatched.


583
00:34:32.998 --> 00:34:34.266
Says a chicken.

584
00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:35.568
I'm a rooster! You hear me?

585
00:34:35.634 --> 00:34:37.236
A rooster!
Will you knock it off?


586
00:34:37.303 --> 00:34:38.804
Last time we clucked,
you said


587
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:42.308
you could protect the Guardian
all by yourself.


588
00:34:42.374 --> 00:34:43.576
Isn't that right, Goat?

589
00:34:45.511 --> 00:34:47.980
No explosions indoors.

590
00:34:48.047 --> 00:34:51.450
Are you guys gonna help me?
Loo has to pay
for what she's done.


591
00:34:51.517 --> 00:34:55.221
Kid, this isn't about revenge.
That's not what Guardians do.


592
00:34:55.287 --> 00:34:56.455
Well, maybe they should.

593
00:34:56.522 --> 00:34:57.990
You're staying here
in the temple.


594
00:34:58.057 --> 00:35:00.059
We'll deal with Loo.
What? No!


595
00:35:00.126 --> 00:35:02.128
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did I miss a meeting


596
00:35:02.194 --> 00:35:04.830
where someone
put Mr. Whiskers in charge?


597
00:35:04.897 --> 00:35:08.200
Believe me, drumsticks,
I don't wanna be here
with you either.


598
00:35:08.267 --> 00:35:09.568
Drumsticks?

599
00:35:09.635 --> 00:35:11.437
I'll show you
what drumsticks taste like!


600
00:35:11.504 --> 00:35:13.572
Do I need to knock
you two down a size?


601
00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:15.241
Guys. Hey. Hey!

602
00:35:15.307 --> 00:35:17.977
Fine! If you want me
to show you...


603
00:35:18.043 --> 00:35:19.178
That's adorable.

604
00:35:19.245 --> 00:35:20.780
Not helping, Naomi.

605
00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:22.414
Think you're
so big and tough?


606
00:35:22.481 --> 00:35:24.817
Roosters take out cats
all the time.


607
00:35:24.884 --> 00:35:28.654
Thousands of years old,
and you still behave
like children.


608
00:35:28.721 --> 00:35:31.857
So tiny. And so angry.

609
00:35:31.924 --> 00:35:34.093
You're one peck away from death.
The death peck.


610
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.761
Well, you're lucky
you're not lunch.


611
00:35:35.828 --> 00:35:39.064
Hey! Where's Tom?

612
00:35:39.765 --> 00:35:41.500
Where'd he go? Rabbit?

613
00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:44.503
Okay. I hear running.

614
00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.272
Into the alley and--

615
00:35:46.338 --> 00:35:48.240
The kid
totally ghosted us.


616
00:35:48.307 --> 00:35:49.875
Yeah, he's gone.

617
00:35:49.942 --> 00:35:51.911
Come on.
We can't lose him.


618
00:36:31.851 --> 00:36:32.818
Sorry.

619
00:36:32.885 --> 00:36:34.420
Wait, you don't talk too,
do you?


620
00:36:34.486 --> 00:36:37.056
Of course you don't.

621
00:36:37.122 --> 00:36:42.795
Squirrels don't talk,
just tigers and rats
and monkeys and dragons.


622
00:36:53.205 --> 00:36:54.173
Whoa!

623
00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:03.782
What the...

624
00:37:13.459 --> 00:37:14.560
Tom!

625
00:37:14.627 --> 00:37:16.295
If I had known this place

626
00:37:16.362 --> 00:37:19.498
was so nice on the inside,
I would have robbed it
a long time ago.


627
00:37:19.565 --> 00:37:20.866
It's all an illusion.

628
00:37:20.933 --> 00:37:23.269
There's dark <i>fashu</i>
at work here.


629
00:37:37.549 --> 00:37:40.052
Let's split up.
We can cover more ground
that way.


630
00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:41.921
No. We're stronger together.

631
00:37:41.987 --> 00:37:44.056
Fine.
We'll stick together.


632
00:37:45.524 --> 00:37:46.792
But separately.

633
00:37:46.859 --> 00:37:48.527
How is that sticking together?

634
00:37:48.594 --> 00:37:50.496
Huh?

635
00:37:53.966 --> 00:37:55.868
Am I the only one
who's hearing this?


636
00:37:55.935 --> 00:37:58.070
Everybody can hear it,
furball!


637
00:37:58.137 --> 00:38:00.572
I'm so happy for you,
but it sounds better
in my ears.


638
00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:04.310
<i>♪ Look at us, yeah

The other Zodiacs!

648
00:38:32.738 --> 00:38:34.340
Loo must have
captured them.


649
00:38:36.075 --> 00:38:38.844
Listen up! My ears got this!

650
00:38:44.917 --> 00:38:46.685
Go! Find the others!

651
00:38:46.752 --> 00:38:47.753
I'm on it.

652
00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:52.858
Okay, umbrella!

653
00:38:52.925 --> 00:38:55.260
Get ready for some wings!

654
00:38:59.565 --> 00:39:00.833
Rav?

655
00:39:07.006 --> 00:39:08.007
Rav?

656
00:39:12.578 --> 00:39:15.381
Tom! Hi. Um...

657
00:39:16.315 --> 00:39:17.883
What are you doing here?

658
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.518
I'm living in here.

659
00:39:19.585 --> 00:39:22.187
Is that a sword you're carrying?
What is this, cosplay?


660
00:39:22.254 --> 00:39:24.623
You never mentioned you lived
in a haunted mansion.


661
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.225
Haunted?
Rav.


662
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:29.061
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your little friend?


663
00:39:29.128 --> 00:39:31.630
Yeah, sorry. This is Tom.

664
00:39:31.697 --> 00:39:34.299
Tom, this is
my foster mother, Loo.


665
00:39:34.366 --> 00:39:35.534
Loo?

666
00:39:37.202 --> 00:39:39.405
Tom! What are you doing?

667
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.307
Hello, Thomas.

668
00:39:42.975 --> 00:39:45.844
You are truly a delight.

669
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:47.379
What the heck?

670
00:39:53.852 --> 00:39:55.320
What are you?

671
00:39:57.056 --> 00:39:58.190
Go!

672
00:39:58.257 --> 00:40:00.559
He's wearing a necklace, Rav.

673
00:40:00.626 --> 00:40:01.627
I can't stop!

674
00:40:01.693 --> 00:40:03.362
Bring it to me now.

675
00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:04.430
Tom, I--

676
00:40:04.496 --> 00:40:06.331
The necklace, Rav?

677
00:40:08.634 --> 00:40:10.436
He's not wearing one.
What?


678
00:40:10.502 --> 00:40:13.338
He doesn't have anything!
Just let him go!


679
00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:14.440
Enough!

680
00:40:15.541 --> 00:40:18.277
Rav!
Where is the Phoenix?


681
00:40:18.877 --> 00:40:20.112
Tom!

682
00:40:20.712 --> 00:40:22.481
Tom!

683
00:40:22.548 --> 00:40:27.352
I've been searching
for the Phoenix
for a thousand years, Thomas.


684
00:40:27.419 --> 00:40:31.890
Tell me where it is,
and I'll spare you.


685
00:40:31.957 --> 00:40:35.227
You and sweet, stupid Rav.

686
00:40:37.729 --> 00:40:39.998
Tell me where it is!

687
00:40:40.566 --> 00:40:42.301
Okay, okay. Please, wait.

688
00:40:42.367 --> 00:40:43.402
Wait.

689
00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:46.438
It's under a rock on my porch.

690
00:40:46.505 --> 00:40:49.775
Wait, wait.
No, no, it's actually
inside my pocket.


691
00:40:49.842 --> 00:40:51.477
Unless it's inside my sock--

692
00:40:51.543 --> 00:40:53.078
You think I'm a fool?

693
00:40:53.145 --> 00:40:55.547
No. For sure it's in my hat.

694
00:40:55.614 --> 00:40:57.149
Wait, I'm not wearing a hat.

695
00:41:00.786 --> 00:41:02.020
Tom!

696
00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:08.961
Tiger.

697
00:41:09.361 --> 00:41:10.395
Dragon.

698
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:12.831
Rat.

699
00:41:14.533 --> 00:41:17.302
Where's Monkey?

700
00:41:18.003 --> 00:41:20.873
Ah, perfect.

701
00:41:23.342 --> 00:41:26.278
When the last of you Zodiac
die here with young Thomas,


702
00:41:26.345 --> 00:41:30.015
there will be no one left
to stop me from finding it.


703
00:41:34.887 --> 00:41:36.622
What's happening?

704
00:41:36.688 --> 00:41:38.590
Everyone hold on to something!

705
00:41:38.657 --> 00:41:40.559
Whoa!

706
00:41:45.931 --> 00:41:48.400
Ow! Sidney!
Is that my sword?


707
00:41:48.901 --> 00:41:50.135
What?

708
00:41:52.004 --> 00:41:54.106
Uh, everyone can swim, right?

709
00:41:54.973 --> 00:41:58.277
Swim? Yes.
Breathe underwater? No!


710
00:42:23.402 --> 00:42:25.270
Guys, I think I found a way out,

711
00:42:25.337 --> 00:42:28.440
but I might be
the only one who can fit.


712
00:42:28.507 --> 00:42:31.176
Oh, I'll make us fit.
Everyone, hold tight!


713
00:42:31.877 --> 00:42:32.844
Come on!

714
00:42:32.911 --> 00:42:34.112
Okay.

715
00:43:17.322 --> 00:43:22.261
Um, Naomi,
does this shrinking spell
have an expiration date?


716
00:43:23.095 --> 00:43:25.397
Holy shrimp fried rice!

717
00:43:25.464 --> 00:43:29.501
I feel so weird.

718
00:43:29.568 --> 00:43:30.702
We may have a problem!

719
00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:32.204
Hurry, Dragon!
Oh.


720
00:43:32.271 --> 00:43:33.305
What?

721
00:43:47.619 --> 00:43:48.987
Well done, Naomi.

722
00:43:49.388 --> 00:43:50.956
Guys? Guys?

723
00:43:51.023 --> 00:43:52.324
Anyone?

724
00:43:53.558 --> 00:43:55.927
Tom, I--

725
00:43:56.962 --> 00:43:58.497
Thank you for saving me.

726
00:44:05.304 --> 00:44:10.142
I can't see!
It's all darkness!


727
00:44:10.208 --> 00:44:13.078
Oh, is this the end?

728
00:44:13.145 --> 00:44:15.881
Phew! Well, that went great.

729
00:44:20.952 --> 00:44:22.587
<i>Yaoguai.</i>

730
00:44:22.654 --> 00:44:27.192
Tom, now this is very important.
Where'd you stash the Phoenix?


731
00:44:27.259 --> 00:44:28.593
Someplace lucky.

732
00:44:29.461 --> 00:44:30.729
I
-I hope.

733
00:44:36.234 --> 00:44:38.170
In a bowl of fortune cookies?

734
00:44:38.236 --> 00:44:39.638
Super smart, right?

735
00:44:39.705 --> 00:44:43.975
I guess it's "fortunate"
nobody ate it!


736
00:44:59.224 --> 00:45:01.493
I thought it was funny.

737
00:45:02.527 --> 00:45:05.330
I've seen place mats
like these all my life.


738
00:45:05.397 --> 00:45:07.766
And the whole time,
they were based on you guys.


739
00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:09.501
Loosely based.

740
00:45:09.568 --> 00:45:10.635
Look at this.

741
00:45:10.702 --> 00:45:15.140
What is this, a sausage?
With legs?


742
00:45:15.207 --> 00:45:17.576
I do not have facial hair.

743
00:45:17.642 --> 00:45:21.246
I do. And I look good.

744
00:45:23.014 --> 00:45:25.050
I miss Pig.

745
00:45:25.117 --> 00:45:26.618
I miss them all.

746
00:45:26.685 --> 00:45:28.153
They're our family.

747
00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.088
We gotta save them.

748
00:45:30.155 --> 00:45:34.493
Whatever I need to know
to be a Guardian,
you have to teach me.


749
00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:35.627
Please.

750
00:45:35.694 --> 00:45:38.430
The Guardian always trains
the next Guardian.


751
00:45:39.998 --> 00:45:41.533
Look, the kid's right.

752
00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.570
Without Mrs. Lee,
we don't have much choice,
do we?


753
00:45:49.574 --> 00:45:52.043
Your job is to connect
with the Phoenix.


754
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.412
Mistral?

755
00:45:56.047 --> 00:45:57.215
Whoa.

756
00:45:57.282 --> 00:45:59.851
Clear your mind
of all distraction.


757
00:45:59.918 --> 00:46:03.188
In order to see the Phoenix,
you must focus, Tom.


758
00:46:04.656 --> 00:46:08.360
The power of the Phoenix
is the greatest
in this universe.


759
00:46:08.427 --> 00:46:10.562
In the right hands,
it creates.


760
00:46:10.629 --> 00:46:14.399
And in the wrong hands,
like Loo's, it destroys.


761
00:46:14.466 --> 00:46:16.635
So what happens
if she gets it?


762
00:46:16.701 --> 00:46:18.670
She'll unleash its power
on Lunar New Year,


763
00:46:18.737 --> 00:46:21.840
when the chi is
at its most potent.


764
00:46:21.907 --> 00:46:24.643
Then use the Phoenix
to destroy all of humanity


765
00:46:24.709 --> 00:46:27.813
and reign over the world
in darkness for all of eternity.


766
00:46:27.879 --> 00:46:29.748
Okay, that does sound bad.

767
00:46:29.815 --> 00:46:32.818
If it were ever unleashed,
no one could touch it
and survive,


768
00:46:32.884 --> 00:46:34.519
not even a Guardian.

769
00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:37.722
But it's okay to wear it
around my neck, though.
Got it.


770
00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:39.825
Steamed dumplings.
Very delicious.


771
00:46:39.891 --> 00:46:40.892
I'm not hungry.

772
00:46:40.959 --> 00:46:43.361
Eat it!
I mean, mmm.


773
00:46:43.428 --> 00:46:45.630
Tom, pass me the soy sauce.

774
00:46:45.697 --> 00:46:46.965
Without your hands.

775
00:46:47.032 --> 00:46:48.800
How?
Chi lines.


776
00:46:48.867 --> 00:46:52.437
You know, it's like strings
of magical energy
that are everywhere.


777
00:46:52.504 --> 00:46:54.105
You just grab on to one.

778
00:46:54.172 --> 00:46:55.407
Like this.

779
00:46:56.475 --> 00:46:57.776
Oh.

780
00:46:59.211 --> 00:47:01.713
Yo!

781
00:47:03.548 --> 00:47:05.150
Can you see the Phoenix?

782
00:47:05.217 --> 00:47:06.284
No.

783
00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:09.421
I'm easily scared of everything,

784
00:47:09.488 --> 00:47:11.890
so protection spells
come in handy.


785
00:47:11.957 --> 00:47:14.426
Protection spell!

786
00:47:15.827 --> 00:47:17.596
Protection spell.

787
00:47:21.466 --> 00:47:25.303
Nope. Can you teach me
to blast stuff with <i>fashu</i> now?


788
00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:27.038
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.


789
00:47:27.105 --> 00:47:28.640
What did you say?
<i>Fashu.</i>


790
00:47:30.575 --> 00:47:32.878
Feel the chi inside you.

791
00:47:34.379 --> 00:47:35.881
And let it flow.

792
00:47:38.016 --> 00:47:39.851
Terrible idea.

793
00:47:39.918 --> 00:47:41.152
<i>Fashu?</i>

794
00:47:41.219 --> 00:47:42.254
<i>Fashu.</i>

795
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.588
Yeah, <i>fashu.</i>

796
00:47:43.655 --> 00:47:45.323
<i>Fashu!</i>

797
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.759
<i>Fashu?</i>
Your intonation's
all wrong.


798
00:47:48.793 --> 00:47:49.861
No.

799
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:53.698
Yo! Did you see that?

800
00:47:53.765 --> 00:47:55.567
Fan-- <i>Fan-shu.</i>

801
00:47:55.634 --> 00:47:57.302
You just said
"sweet potato"!


802
00:47:57.369 --> 00:47:58.803
"Sweet potato"!

803
00:48:01.773 --> 00:48:03.308
Yeah!

804
00:48:04.409 --> 00:48:05.744
Dessert!

805
00:48:09.414 --> 00:48:10.415
Yes!

806
00:48:10.482 --> 00:48:12.017
Really?
No.


807
00:48:12.083 --> 00:48:13.485
Yeah!

808
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:29.701
All of this amounts to nothing
if you can't see the Phoenix!


809
00:48:29.768 --> 00:48:31.303
Hu.
Whatever!


810
00:48:31.369 --> 00:48:34.272
I'm sorry I can't connect
with the magic bird better, okay?


811
00:48:34.339 --> 00:48:37.742
All the stories Mrs. Lee
told you about the Guardians
and the Zodiac


812
00:48:37.809 --> 00:48:40.045
weren't just
to get you to sleep.


813
00:48:40.111 --> 00:48:42.314
She was teaching you, Tom.

814
00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.815
I told you,
I didn't know I--


815
00:48:43.882 --> 00:48:45.884
You don't need to know
to understand.


816
00:48:45.951 --> 00:48:48.853
How about
we all take a break
and cool off.


817
00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.888
Fine!

818
00:48:55.694 --> 00:48:57.162
He hates me.

819
00:48:57.228 --> 00:48:58.830
Is that what you think?

820
00:48:59.531 --> 00:49:02.500
Hu gave his life for you.
What?


821
00:49:02.567 --> 00:49:06.037
<i>That night on the bridge.
You were just a baby.</i>


822
00:49:13.712 --> 00:49:16.514
<i>Hu saved your life
at great cost.</i>


823
00:49:16.581 --> 00:49:19.284
<i>The Ghost Cart
was coming for him.</i>


824
00:49:19.351 --> 00:49:24.022
<i>Only by giving him
a part of her soul,
by joining it with his,</i>


825
00:49:24.089 --> 00:49:26.524
<i>was Mrs. Lee able to save him.</i>

826
00:49:29.694 --> 00:49:33.565
There's a part
of my grandma's soul
inside Hu?


827
00:49:33.632 --> 00:49:37.502
You can see it sometimes.
It's in the eyes.


828
00:49:40.305 --> 00:49:43.675
I'm impressed.
He's really coming along.


829
00:49:43.742 --> 00:49:45.644
It's not enough,
and you know it.


830
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:48.546
Without a Guardian to teach him
how to connect with the Phoenix,


831
00:49:48.613 --> 00:49:49.614
none of the rest matters.

832
00:49:49.681 --> 00:49:51.516
We're doing our best, Hu.

833
00:49:52.183 --> 00:49:53.485
But we're not Mrs. Lee.

834
00:49:53.551 --> 00:49:55.220
I've been watching him
a long time.


835
00:49:55.286 --> 00:49:58.456
You want to know why
he can't connect
with the Phoenix?


836
00:49:58.523 --> 00:50:00.825
'Cause he doesn't know
who he is.


837
00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:04.863
Maybe he never will.

I'm home, Ah Ma.

854
00:51:19.137 --> 00:51:21.072
I don't understand.

855
00:51:21.139 --> 00:51:23.174
Why didn't you tell me?

856
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:27.045
How am I supposed to
do this without you?


857
00:51:31.483 --> 00:51:33.918
No. No, that's impossible.

858
00:51:35.019 --> 00:51:36.921
Are-
- Are you--

859
00:51:37.489 --> 00:51:39.557
Is it really you?

860
00:51:39.624 --> 00:51:42.694
Did you think they could
get rid of me that easily?


861
00:51:43.795 --> 00:51:44.829
Ah Ma.

862
00:51:46.865 --> 00:51:50.068
What happened?
Where did you go?


863
00:51:50.135 --> 00:51:53.004
A bedtime story for later.

864
00:51:53.071 --> 00:51:56.141
Now tell me,
do you still have my necklace?


865
00:51:57.809 --> 00:51:59.811
You never should have
given it to me.


866
00:51:59.878 --> 00:52:03.715
I am no Guardian.
I can't even see the Phoenix.


867
00:52:03.782 --> 00:52:07.552
It's okay, Tom.
Everything's going to be okay.


868
00:52:07.619 --> 00:52:08.787
I'll take it now.

869
00:52:08.853 --> 00:52:10.188
It's not her!

870
00:52:11.489 --> 00:52:12.657
No!

871
00:52:12.724 --> 00:52:14.225
Leave her alone!

872
00:52:14.292 --> 00:52:19.430
Oh, look at you.
Somebody's been learning.


873
00:52:19.497 --> 00:52:22.534
And you. So ungrateful.

874
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.702
You disappoint your Mama Loo.

875
00:52:24.769 --> 00:52:27.539
Yeah?
You were a terrible mom!


876
00:52:29.407 --> 00:52:31.075
And your cooking sucked!
Let's go!


877
00:52:31.142 --> 00:52:32.610
Go, go, go!
Okay!


878
00:52:49.127 --> 00:52:50.862
Thank you, Thomas.

879
00:52:59.103 --> 00:53:00.738
I can't believe
he did this again.


880
00:53:00.805 --> 00:53:02.774
Why does he keep
running away from me?


881
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:07.679
Oh, does he? Or do you keep
pushing him away? Hmm?


882
00:53:07.745 --> 00:53:09.447
That's not true at all.
Oh, really?


883
00:53:09.514 --> 00:53:11.216
I've had about enough of--
Ha!


884
00:53:11.282 --> 00:53:12.617
Typical cat behavior.

885
00:53:12.684 --> 00:53:14.052
What? I don't--

886
00:53:14.118 --> 00:53:16.187
Fiercely independent?
Territorial?


887
00:53:16.254 --> 00:53:18.723
Should I even mention
the excessive grooming?


888
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:21.993
Hey.
A cat won't come to you
when you call them.


889
00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.797
They want everything
on their own terms,
when it suits them,


890
00:53:25.864 --> 00:53:28.433
even with the people
they truly care about.


891
00:53:28.499 --> 00:53:30.134
Am I wrong?

892
00:53:31.002 --> 00:53:32.437
No.

893
00:53:32.503 --> 00:53:35.440
I pushed them all away.

894
00:53:35.506 --> 00:53:40.044
Tom, the Zodiac,
you probably the most.


895
00:53:41.779 --> 00:53:44.082
But you wouldn't
leave me, Dragon.


896
00:53:44.148 --> 00:53:45.617
Why is that?

897
00:53:45.683 --> 00:53:49.621
I guess I'm just a cat person.

898
00:53:57.395 --> 00:53:58.463
Tom!

899
00:53:58.529 --> 00:54:00.198
I lost it.

900
00:54:01.332 --> 00:54:03.301
Loo has the Phoenix.

901
00:54:42.173 --> 00:54:46.978
I thought
maybe if I went back
to our house,


902
00:54:47.045 --> 00:54:50.214
I could understand
why she didn't tell me,


903
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:51.916
and I just found this.

904
00:54:55.753 --> 00:54:59.157
Wow. I gave that to you
when you were just a baby.


905
00:55:00.124 --> 00:55:01.326
You did?

906
00:55:01.392 --> 00:55:04.696
I've been watching over you
your whole life.


907
00:55:04.762 --> 00:55:07.165
Ever since that night
on the bridge.


908
00:55:07.999 --> 00:55:09.834
We knew
Loo would be back.


909
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:14.739
So your grandma and I
decided to hide you,
to protect the bloodline.


910
00:55:14.806 --> 00:55:16.007
And it worked--

911
00:55:16.074 --> 00:55:19.010
Until I threw that kid
into the ceiling?


912
00:55:19.077 --> 00:55:22.447
And pulled down
the protective charms.
But you didn't know.


913
00:55:22.513 --> 00:55:25.083
I let Loo take the Phoenix.

914
00:55:26.084 --> 00:55:28.653
That's on me.

915
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.122
I'm sorry I wasn't
the best mentor.


916
00:55:32.256 --> 00:55:35.827
But what I'm finally realizing
after a thousand years


917
00:55:35.893 --> 00:55:38.863
is what matters most,

918
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.799
and that's how
you move forward.


919
00:55:41.866 --> 00:55:45.536
I don't know if I can be
who you need me to be.


920
00:55:45.603 --> 00:55:47.138
You already are.

921
00:55:47.739 --> 00:55:49.240
It's in your blood.

922
00:55:49.307 --> 00:55:52.643
You come
from a thousand generations
of Guardians, Tom.


923
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.580
Your grandma
gave you the necklace.


924
00:55:55.646 --> 00:55:57.215
She believed in you.

925
00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.118
All right.

926
00:56:00.718 --> 00:56:02.353
How do we find Loo?

927
00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.688
We find the Phoenix.

928
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:08.226
Loo's waiting for sundown,
when the energy is at its peak.


929
00:56:14.432 --> 00:56:17.268
All right,
reach out and find that Phoenix.


930
00:56:28.513 --> 00:56:31.883
It's too much.

931
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:34.752
Tom, focus.

932
00:56:34.819 --> 00:56:36.788
I can't. I'm losing it.

933
00:56:36.854 --> 00:56:41.459
Just breathe.
Find something to hold on to,
something to anchor yourself.


934
00:56:41.526 --> 00:56:43.961
It's okay. You're okay.

935
00:56:54.338 --> 00:56:55.273
Loo!

936
00:56:55.339 --> 00:56:57.909
Thomas, just like
your grandmother.


937
00:56:57.975 --> 00:57:00.344
Persistent to the end.

938
00:57:10.321 --> 00:57:11.355
Whoa!

939
00:57:13.424 --> 00:57:14.759
Hey!

940
00:57:37.081 --> 00:57:39.117
Face full of monkey paw!

941
00:57:39.183 --> 00:57:42.086
Tear the animals apart.

942
00:57:44.055 --> 00:57:46.290
Naughty, naughty <i>yaoguai!</i>

943
00:57:46.357 --> 00:57:49.827
Oh, now your hand
is a dumpling!


944
00:57:50.828 --> 00:57:52.697
Mind if I borrow this?
Huh?


945
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:54.365
Bye. Thanks!

946
00:57:59.637 --> 00:58:01.072
Yeah!

947
00:58:47.151 --> 00:58:48.953
Protection spell!

948
00:58:51.155 --> 00:58:53.257
Protection spell?

949
00:58:53.324 --> 00:58:56.327
If only you were there
to protect your grandmother.


950
00:58:56.394 --> 00:58:58.362
Monster!

951
00:59:04.802 --> 00:59:06.504
Hang on!

952
00:59:07.605 --> 00:59:08.606
No!

953
00:59:12.877 --> 00:59:14.412
<i>Ah Tom.</i>

954
00:59:14.879 --> 00:59:16.214
Ah Ma.

955
00:59:21.719 --> 00:59:23.087
Tom!

956
00:59:24.222 --> 00:59:25.423
Tom!

957
00:59:27.692 --> 00:59:31.162
No!

958
00:59:35.766 --> 00:59:37.001
Hu!

959
00:59:38.169 --> 00:59:40.838
I just can't seem
to stop taking away


960
00:59:40.905 --> 00:59:42.707
all the people you care about.

961
01:00:02.059 --> 01:00:03.728
Poor Thomas.

962
01:00:03.794 --> 01:00:08.566
Do you know why
I didn't kill you
that night on the bridge?


963
01:00:10.034 --> 01:00:14.071
<i>Even then,
I saw it in your eyes.</i>


964
01:00:14.138 --> 01:00:18.676
<i>You were no threat,
because you were no Guardian.</i>


965
01:00:18.743 --> 01:00:22.146
No, that's just another lie.
Hu saved me that night.


966
01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.249
Well, where's
your tiger now?


967
01:00:29.186 --> 01:00:31.055
Hey! Loo's umbrella!

968
01:00:31.122 --> 01:00:34.058
Quick, grab it!
We gotta free the other Zodiacs!


969
01:00:35.293 --> 01:00:37.662
This is crazy! 
This is crazy!

970
01:00:38.262 --> 01:00:40.965
I got it. I got it.

971
01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:44.068
No!

972
01:00:45.936 --> 01:00:49.073
I got it!
Chasing an evil umbrella
through a swarm of monsters.


973
01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.741
This is fine!

974
01:00:50.808 --> 01:00:52.643
Naomi! A little help here.

975
01:00:55.112 --> 01:00:56.681
This is how you help?

976
01:00:56.747 --> 01:01:02.453
You have no idea
how long I've waited
for this moment.


977
01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.390
With the power of the Phoenix,
I can remake the world


978
01:01:07.725 --> 01:01:10.127
without humans,

979
01:01:10.194 --> 01:01:15.166
and I've saved you
a front-row seat.


980
01:01:27.745 --> 01:01:29.246
Anytime, Naomi!

981
01:01:29.313 --> 01:01:32.049
Let my friends go,
you stupid umbrella!


982
01:01:47.098 --> 01:01:51.635
All right, Zodiacs.
We got a Guardian to protect!
Together.


983
01:01:52.203 --> 01:01:53.704
Let's do this!

984
01:02:02.947 --> 01:02:05.116
Tom?

985
01:02:09.053 --> 01:02:10.488
No. No!

986
01:02:10.554 --> 01:02:14.558
Look at it, Thomas.
Isn't it beautiful?


987
01:02:18.696 --> 01:02:20.398
We're coming, kid!

988
01:02:21.399 --> 01:02:23.601
Way ahead of you, Tiger!

989
01:02:24.335 --> 01:02:26.570
Giddyap!

990
01:02:26.637 --> 01:02:29.640
I'll show you who's in charge!

991
01:02:30.107 --> 01:02:32.643
Cannonball!

992
01:02:38.849 --> 01:02:40.050
Throw me another one!

993
01:02:40.117 --> 01:02:41.552
Yeah, that's right.

994
01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:43.788
Can you hear that?

995
01:02:55.933 --> 01:02:59.303
Hu! Yeah! Zodiac up!

996
01:03:14.585 --> 01:03:15.853
Whoa.

997
01:03:20.491 --> 01:03:21.692
Whee!

998
01:03:21.759 --> 01:03:22.793
Whoa!

999
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.229
Monkey foot!

1000
01:03:31.836 --> 01:03:32.870
Hi-yah!

1001
01:03:34.939 --> 01:03:35.940
Goat!

1002
01:03:40.845 --> 01:03:43.214
You're too late!

1003
01:03:55.826 --> 01:03:57.561
Enough!

1004
01:03:59.663 --> 01:04:03.767
Now I end this
once and for all.


1005
01:04:07.371 --> 01:04:09.139
Come, Thomas.

1006
01:04:09.206 --> 01:04:11.342
You can die fighting

1007
01:04:11.408 --> 01:04:13.911
just like your grandmother did.

1008
01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:30.561
We don't need to fight.

1009
01:04:30.628 --> 01:04:34.365
What do you think
you're doing, boy?


1010
01:04:35.366 --> 01:04:37.401
We don't need these.

1011
01:04:38.435 --> 01:04:40.304
We need this.

1012
01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:41.805
And this.

1013
01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:46.377
I understand now, Ah Ma.

1014
01:04:51.048 --> 01:04:53.584
Come, boy. Fight me.

1015
01:04:54.585 --> 01:04:55.853
Tom.

1016
01:04:58.756 --> 01:05:00.724
I see the Phoenix.

1017
01:05:03.127 --> 01:05:04.328
No!

1018
01:05:15.239 --> 01:05:17.374
Shh. Hey.

1019
01:05:18.742 --> 01:05:19.944
It's okay.

1020
01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:23.247
I'm here to protect you.

1021
01:05:42.266 --> 01:05:45.903
In your hands,
the Phoenix destroys!


1022
01:05:48.238 --> 01:05:52.476
No!

1023
01:05:52.543 --> 01:05:54.778
But in the right hands...

1024
01:06:32.016 --> 01:06:33.717
Tom! Wake up!

1025
01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:35.886
Tom, do you hear me?

1026
01:06:37.388 --> 01:06:39.156
Guys, he's not breathing.

1027
01:06:40.891 --> 01:06:41.759
Tom?

1028
01:06:41.825 --> 01:06:43.894
Come on, stay with us, buddy.

1029
01:06:45.963 --> 01:06:46.997
No. No!

1030
01:06:48.298 --> 01:06:50.034
We just can't let him die.

1031
01:06:50.901 --> 01:06:52.536
Nu Kua?

1032
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:55.239
Do it.

1033
01:06:55.305 --> 01:06:56.707
Okay, quick!

1034
01:06:56.774 --> 01:06:58.509
It's gonna take
all of us together.


1035
01:06:58.575 --> 01:06:59.910
Thank you, my friends.

1036
01:07:20.364 --> 01:07:23.500
Empress! I seek your help!

1037
01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:25.502
Empress!

1038
01:07:37.081 --> 01:07:40.684
My apprentice,
he sacrificed himself
to save the mortals.


1039
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:43.754
The boy is beyond healing.

1040
01:07:43.821 --> 01:07:45.756
But not beyond saving.

1041
01:07:47.124 --> 01:07:52.129
Look down, Tiger.
Tell me, what do you see?


1042
01:07:52.196 --> 01:07:54.865
Water. An ocean.

1043
01:07:54.932 --> 01:08:00.037
The Sea of Tears,
where all souls go at the end.


1044
01:08:07.044 --> 01:08:08.412
Take mine instead.

1045
01:08:08.479 --> 01:08:11.081
Merge our souls
as Mrs. Lee did for me!


1046
01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:23.460
You could die
along with him.


1047
01:08:23.994 --> 01:08:25.496
I'm not afraid.

1048
01:08:26.563 --> 01:08:27.798
I see that.

1049
01:08:28.632 --> 01:08:32.102
Your spirit has never
been subtle, Tiger.


1050
01:08:38.142 --> 01:08:40.077
Repeat these words.

1051
01:08:41.178 --> 01:08:44.348
"With my blood, I join you."

1052
01:08:44.414 --> 01:08:47.117
With my blood, I join you.

1053
01:08:47.184 --> 01:08:50.754
"With my breath, I bind you."

1054
01:08:51.755 --> 01:08:56.527
With my breath,
I bind you.


1055
01:09:29.626 --> 01:09:31.795
Hey, kid.

1056
01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:34.164
What happened to you?

1057
01:09:34.231 --> 01:09:35.432
What do you know?

1058
01:09:35.499 --> 01:09:38.068
I guess a tiger
can change his stripes!


1059
01:09:38.135 --> 01:09:41.605
Great.
Now I'm gonna be hearing
that one forever.


1060
01:09:41.672 --> 01:09:44.842
So you couldn't
let me die, huh?


1061
01:09:44.908 --> 01:09:47.177
Yeah, let's not make
some big fuss about it.


1062
01:10:05.262 --> 01:10:06.730
Thomas Lee,

1063
01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:11.001
we name you Guardian.

1064
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:15.606
Nice work.
Congratulations.


1065
01:10:15.672 --> 01:10:19.509
You're gonna do great, kid,
the sooner you listen
to everything that I say.


1066
01:10:19.576 --> 01:10:22.646
They grow up so fast.

1067
01:10:24.815 --> 01:10:27.551
Is he your fiancé?

1068
01:10:27.618 --> 01:10:29.920
What? No.
We're in high school.


1069
01:10:29.987 --> 01:10:32.122
It's not too late.

1070
01:10:33.123 --> 01:10:35.726
There's just one more thing
I have for you.


1071
01:10:39.429 --> 01:10:41.064
A sacred gift.

1072
01:10:45.335 --> 01:10:47.804
Uh, cool. It's empty.

1073
01:10:48.272 --> 01:10:49.273
What?

1074
01:10:49.339 --> 01:10:50.540
Hmm, okay, okay.

1075
01:10:50.607 --> 01:10:51.875
It's like a metaphor,
isn't it?


1076
01:10:51.942 --> 01:10:53.243
Sid.

1077
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:58.048
What? Oh, sure, blame the rat.
I see how it is.


1078
01:10:59.449 --> 01:11:01.985
I have no idea
how it got there.


1079
01:11:03.587 --> 01:11:06.690
I-I-I made you a key
to my shop.


1080
01:11:08.392 --> 01:11:10.460
That's your sacred gift?

1081
01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:15.399
I figured you've got
more training to do and you're
gonna need somewhere to stay,


1082
01:11:15.465 --> 01:11:20.270
so maybe it would make sense
if you, I don't know,
consider it your--


1083
01:11:20.337 --> 01:11:21.972
Home?

1084
01:11:24.408 --> 01:11:26.743
Yeah. I mean, if you want.

1085
01:11:28.178 --> 01:11:31.214
Well, I do have
a piece of your soul in me,


1086
01:11:31.281 --> 01:11:35.118
so I guess that
kind of makes us family.


1087
01:11:41.992 --> 01:11:45.429
Okay, I knew we were
gonna need tissues.
You big softy.


1088
01:11:45.495 --> 01:11:47.164
I'm proud of you, Hu.

1089
01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:49.433
It's whatever they're
putting in the incense
these days.


1090
01:11:49.499 --> 01:11:51.134
Yeah. Good cover.

1091
01:11:51.201 --> 01:11:53.570
I get that you're,
like, old-school,


1092
01:11:53.637 --> 01:11:56.139
but it's okay
to have emotions.


1093
01:11:57.874 --> 01:12:00.277
You're about to see
some emotions, apprentice.


1094
01:12:00.344 --> 01:12:02.746
Apprentice? Guardian.

1095
01:12:02.813 --> 01:12:05.649
You've still got a lot
to learn.


1096
01:12:05.716 --> 01:12:07.417
I'm sorry.

1097
01:12:07.484 --> 01:12:09.953
Were you the one who grabbed
the actual Phoenix
and saved the world?


1098
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.457
I don't think so!
I'm the one who saved
your sorry butt over and over.


1099
01:12:13.523 --> 01:12:17.160
Did I ask for your help?
I had it back there.


1100
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:33.643
"Eye of the Tiger"?
You gotta be kidding me.


1101
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:35.212
It's a classic.

1102
01:12:35.278 --> 01:12:37.080
That's not the point.
What?


1103
01:12:37.147 --> 01:12:38.782
You're a tiger.
So what?


1104
01:12:38.849 --> 01:12:40.584
Are you really not
understanding how this is--


1105
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:43.820
This song is
written for me.
Let me just--


1106
01:12:43.887 --> 01:12:46.823
Do not touch that.
Just let me play my music.


1107
01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:48.725
Oh, yeah.

1108
01:12:49.593 --> 01:12:51.795
Oh, yeah. That's my jam.

1109
01:12:51.862 --> 01:12:53.830
You really need to get out more.

1110
01:12:55.499 --> 01:12:57.267
And you need more training.

1111
01:12:58.602 --> 01:13:00.037
Whoa!

1112
01:13:00.537 --> 01:13:01.805
Okay, hold on!

1113
01:13:01.872 --> 01:13:03.907
Hu enjoys this
far too much.


1114
01:13:03.974 --> 01:13:06.176
Five bucks
the kid aces it.


1115
01:13:06.243 --> 01:13:07.277
You're on.

1116
01:13:07.344 --> 01:13:09.780
Just FYI,
I don't have money.


1117
01:13:11.148 --> 01:13:13.817
Whoa. Hey,
what are you doing?


1118
01:13:15.185 --> 01:13:19.056
Whoa! Stop!
No! Wait! Hey. No. No.


1119
01:13:37.507 --> 01:13:39.042
Cool.
