00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.570
<i>Iraq. October 2014.</i>

2
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.930
<i>The first rainstorm</i>

3
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.810
<i>since ISIS fighters captured</i>
<i>large areas of Syria and Iraq.</i>


4
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.450
<i>There's fighting 30 km from my hotel.</i>

5
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.370
<i>The Americans are bombing again.</i>

6
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.490
<i>An Austrian invention has brought me here.</i>

7
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.490
<i>The object is prized worldwide,</i>

8
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.290
<i>even revered as a cult object.</i>

9
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.610
<i>Here in Iraq, too.</i>

10
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.290
<i>In Austria, however,</i>
<i>little is known about it.</i>


11
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.210
<i>The death trade takes place</i>
<i>behind closed doors.</i>


12
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.490
<i>Yeah, for those who never used Glocks,</i>
<i>it's just a pistol.</i>


13
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.130
<i>For me, it's something very unique.</i>
<i>It's special.</i>


14
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.570
<i>Those who use Glocks,</i>
<i>they know what Glock means.</i>


15
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.170
<i>One of the favorites.</i>
<i>They never stop, they never get rusty.</i>


16
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.650
<i>They never stop, they never...</i>
<i>you know, fail you down.</i>


17
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.410
<i>Yeah, on a daily basis,</i>
<i>you deal with this piece,</i>


18
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.290
<i>you become a friend</i>
<i>that you cannot give up.</i>


19
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.410
<i>Like me and you now.</i>
<i>We just met today. Maybe if we,</i>


20
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.130
<i>you know, meet again, like,</i>
<i>a few more times, we become friends.</i>


21
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.530
<i>This is what it is</i>
<i>with me and this Glock here.</i>


22
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.650
<i>Yeah. It's been about an hour</i>
<i>since we met today.</i>


23
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.770
<i>It's the same thing with this.</i>

24
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.330
<i>The longer you use it,</i>
<i>the longer you stay with it,</i>


25
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.530
<i>the more attracted</i>
<i>you will be with this piece.</i>


26
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.370
<i>The weapon of choice was</i>

27
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.210
<i>that favorite gun of drug traffickers</i>
<i>and others bent on mass violence...</i>


28
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.410
<i>...he's a gangster. </i>

29
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.970
<i>In my true honest words,</i>
<i>karma is a bitch.</i>


30
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.330
<i>It will cost you your life, eventually.</i>

31
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.130
<i>It's like the mafia. You can join,</i>
<i>but it's a capital offense to leave.</i>


32
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.170
<i>I felt compelled to call you</i>
<i>all together here now.</i>


33
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.810
<i>Number one,</i>
<i>our right of speech and religion,</i>


34
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.450
<i>then, number two, our right to bear arms.</i>

35
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.530
<i>A nine-millimeter Glock</i>
<i>semi-automatic pistol.</i>


36
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.850
<i>Whatever you do when trying</i>
<i>to establish a gun connection,</i>


37
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.530
<i>never be too direct.</i>

38
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.450
<i>Stop violence!</i>

39
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.650
<i>Stop violence!</i>

40
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.690
<i>Increase peace!</i>

41
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.770
<i>Stop violence!</i>

42
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.330
<i>There's power in the name of Jesus.</i>

43
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.770
<i>It swept the military</i>
<i>and law enforcement worlds in 1984,</i>


44
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.610
<i>after it was first introduced</i>
<i>by an Austrian firm</i>


45
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.810
<i>previously known for cutlery.</i>

46
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.490
<i>The factory and the gun</i>
<i>are both called Glock.</i>


47
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.490
Then, when we'll reassemble it,

48
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.010
we'll put the barrel back in,

49
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.770
make sure it's flat in there.

50
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.570
You gotta take the spring, you're gonna
push the spring in a little bit,


51
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.050
make sure it's parallel with the slide.

52
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.250
Then, you're gonna take the slide
and put it on the lower frame,


53
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.250
starting at the front,
all the way to the back,


54
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.370
pull straight back.

55
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.530
And that is your reassembly
of the Glock firearm.


56
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.530
We're a small store in...
located in Pennsylvania.


57
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.410
And Glock happens to be
one of our major sellers.


58
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.410
<i>Why is that so?</i>

59
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.330
'Cause of their ease of disassembly
and how reliable they are.


60
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.210
They're one of the most reliable,
easiest to use, firearms in the world.


61
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.370
Next to the AK-47.
They're one of the best.


62
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.530
We have the subcompact, the compact,

63
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.530
the full-size,
and then the competition models.


64
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.290
And also, the .45 models.

65
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.610
We... We have…

66
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.650
-Show him the single-stack.
-We offer…


67
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.330
different sizes

68
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.810
of each in the .45s, which are…

69
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.130
even a different... frame size.

70
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.850
That's a single stack,
which is a narrower frame.


71
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.450
That's a Glock 36.

72
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.770
It's a .45 caliber.

73
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.970
<i>And what makes the Glock so popular</i>
<i>in the United States?</i>


74
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.930
Law enforcement use Glock. They carry…
Most law enforcement departments...


75
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.130
Our Pennsylvania State Police
carry the Glock.


76
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.010
That is their duty weapon.

77
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.770
It's a dependable weapon. When you pull
the trigger, gun is gonna go off.


78
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.970
And you two...

79
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.770
-went to Austria?
-Yes.


80
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.930
We were one of three people
that were invited.


81
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.690
Us being a dealer.

82
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.010
One being a wholesaler
that would sell us the weapons.


83
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.170
And also a customer
that we would sell weapons to.


84
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.770
We are from all different parts
of the country.


85
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.730
And we were each allowed to take
one person with us to Austria


86
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.330
to go visit the Glock factory.

87
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.290
It was amazing how fast

88
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.010
that they could make
the barrel and the slide, and...


89
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.010
The machine,
they put them in, and the machine


90
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.530
made 'em and then it just took 'em out
and it cooled them…


91
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.930
Everything was all mechanical,
but there was a lot of workers there.


92
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.570
Glock employed a lot of people
in their factory.


93
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.570
And everybody that we talked to there
seemed to like working there.


94
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.170
Which was really nice.

95
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.090
And I love the mountains up there.
The mountains were really neat.


96
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.730
<i>Ferlach, Kärnten.</i>

97
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.050
<i>Home to Austrian largest weapon factory.</i>

98
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.330
<i>This is Glock's second plant,</i>

99
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.570
<i>beside the first one in Deutsch
-Wagram.</i>

100
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.810
<i>A call for tenders</i>
<i>by the Austrian armed forces</i>


101
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.090
<i>prompted the engineer Gaston Glock,</i>
<i>in the early 1980s,</i>


102
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.330
<i>to develop the perfect pistol.</i>

103
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.810
<i>Despite little experience</i>
<i>in manufacturing firearms,</i>


104
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.490
<i>Glock ended up</i>
<i>revolutionizing gun technology.</i>


105
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.370
<i>His pistol turned a small family business</i>
<i>into a global player in the arms industry,</i>


106
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.890
<i>and its inventor</i>
<i>into one of Austria's richest men.</i>


107
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.810
<i>But the company would have never become</i>
<i>a global brand without the USA</i>


108
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.610
<i>and its gun culture.</i>

109
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.810
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls!


110
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.490
This is the world-famous
Hood Life & Hip Hop Tour


111
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.890
that takes you down through
South Central, Compton, Watts,


112
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.610
all the wonderful areas
that you might have seen in videos,


113
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:13.010
seen in movies such as <i>Menace II Society,</i>
<i>Boyz n the Hood,</i>


114
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.690
<i>Training Day, 
Baby Boy. </i>

115
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.050
We take you there,
because some of these places are known


116
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.890
for being extremely dangerous
and extremely volatile.


117
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.930
And if all the good people
from around the world,


118
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.490
if they make it down there,
they might not fucking make it out.


119
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.050
<i>Glock, Glock, Glock</i>
<i>All get shot</i>


120
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.250
<i>Glock, Glock, Glock</i>
<i>All get shot</i>


121
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.890
Man, I'm fucking starving. Goddamn.

122
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.570
I don't think anything has had
as big an impact


123
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:56.610
on the brand name awareness of Glock

124
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.290
in popular culture
like hip hop. Like rap music.


125
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.210
The brands change...

126
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.210
a lot in hip hop.
It's a very brand-conscious culture.


127
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.850
Clothing brands change over time.

128
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.010
Car companies stay the same.

129
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.450
So, Mercedes has always been popular
in hip hop.


130
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.090
Glock's always been popular in hip hop.

131
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.490
Over the last 25 years,

132
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.410
the references to the product,
to the name Glock,


133
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.650
are in the thousands.

134
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.930
And there are songs
named directly after the Glock.


135
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.850
There're dozens of those songs and...

136
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.610
Every day... I'm a hip hop fan.

137
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.650
I listen to new
rap music, new hip hop.

138
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.690
And every day, there is a song

139
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.170
that comes out
where the Glock gets profiled.


140
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.650
And that's a reflection of the fact
that the artists live


141
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.530
a certain type of life style coming up,

142
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.450
where...

143
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.850
it's necessary,
or they believe it's necessary


144
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.210
to arm themselves, to pack.

145
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.450
So, they end up packing Glock.

146
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.330
<i>Never leave home</i>
<i>Without it</i>


147
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.930
<i>Good thing</i>
<i>We brought the Glock</i>


148
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.570
<i>Cuz I put away a shotgun</i>
<i>Borrow me a Glock</i>


149
00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.610
It's a form of art,

150
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.170
which... is based on rhyming.

151
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.370
So, Glock rhymes with
a lot of cool words:

152
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.770
"lock," "pop," "drop," "cock"...

153
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.610
You know, all that stuff

154
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.090
works in ta... in combination
with the name Glock.


155
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.450
And there's just something powerful
about that name.


156
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:36.570
There's certainly one functional reason
why Glocks are very, very popular.


157
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.730
Because I've been in shootouts.
I've had the unfortunate incident


158
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.650
where I had a weapon that jammed.

159
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.530
It is known by every gang member,

160
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.370
every bank robber...

161
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.770
anybody that's hustlin' down here
in the hood that your Glock


162
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.770
will never fuckin' jam on you.
And that may save your life.


163
00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.730
<i>Keep my shit cocked</i>
<i>Cause the cops got a Glock, too</i>


164
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.410
<i>What the fuck would you do?</i>
<i>Drop them or let them drop you?</i>


165
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.610
<i>I chose droppin' the cop</i>

166
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.610
<i>I got me a Glock</i>
<i>And a Glock for the niggas on my block</i>


167
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.890
The Glock is a gun of choice
in my community.


168
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.050
Like I said,
it's like lookin' at a diamond.


169
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.730
You got all these other stones, of course
you're gonna pick that pretty diamond.


170
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:49.250
And it just out...
It outviews the rest of the guns.


171
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.850
You can put a Glock and you put the rest
of the guns, I guarantee...


172
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.170
And...

173
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.410
people give up a Desert Eagle
and that's a big old, long, steel gun.


174
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.050
But they gonna pick that Glock.

175
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.970
I had an extended clip to mine,
so my Glock shot...


176
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.010
I think 30 plus times.

177
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.690
Like, here the clip.

178
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.490
This was a regular 9 mm with a clip
this long. And...


179
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.410
Man, I'm tellin' you, I was crazy.

180
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.650
<i>There's people all across this country</i>
<i>and in other countries</i>


181
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.170
<i>that listen to this music,</i>
<i>that love this music,</i>


182
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.930
<i>that are influenced by this music</i>
<i>in a very real way.</i>


183
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.250
<i>Gun manufacturers</i>
<i>are getting this all for free.</i>


184
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.690
<i>And the reason they can't acknowledge</i>
<i>this free marketing</i>


185
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.170
<i>is because they know</i>

186
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.130
<i>that it's being marketed</i>
<i>in the context of violence.</i>


187
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.970
<i>Ain't no Glock</i>
<i>Like the one I got</i>


188
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.930
<i>Glock didn't want their name</i>
<i>mentioned in rap music,</i>


189
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.730
<i>because the references were so common</i>

190
00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.370
<i>that people were starting to think</i>
<i>that Glock was just another name for gun.</i>


191
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.850
<i>And that is their worst nightmare.</i>

192
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.250
<i>They want to ensure that people know</i>

193
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.690
<i>that that name and the look of the gun</i>
<i>are protected.</i>


194
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.770
<i>They're distinct.</i>
<i>'Cause Glock is something special.</i>


195
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.010
<i>It's all black, it's solid,</i>

196
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.410
<i>stripped down</i>
<i>to a purely utilitarian tool.</i>


197
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.850
<i>Cool, rugged.</i>
<i>You see what I got. You know what it does.</i>


198
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.490
<i>I ain't afraid to use it.</i>

199
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.170
<i>Don't test me when I got my Glock.</i>

200
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.650
Back and forward. let's go.

201
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.730
Jab.

202
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.210
There you go.

203
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.850
Look at me. Put it back.

204
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.090
Jab.

205
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:47.890
Put it back.

206
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:49.570
Jab.

207
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.570
There we go! That's what I'm talkin'!
Do it again!


208
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.730
To be a gang banger...

209
00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.090
and to not have a gun
is just like a barber without clippers.


210
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.210
So...

211
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.650
gang, gun, grows hand in hand.

212
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.570
You can't be in a gang without a gun,
because this gun is...


213
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.170
If you can't fight...

214
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.530
But if you can fight...

215
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.770
this gun is bigger than life.

216
00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.610
This gun is what puts you on top
and puts you above everybody else.


217
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.890
Especially if you know
what to do with it.

218
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.450
Go. One, two, three.

219
00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.210
<i>I always wanted to be a drug dealer.</i>

220
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.970
<i>‘Cause my life was so poor</i>

221
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.890
<i>and the drug dealers, the pimps,</i>
<i>the hustlers would ride down the street</i>


222
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.530
<i>-with their pretty cars.</i>
-Good job, AJ.


223
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.090
Yes. sir.

224
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.770
No. Hey.

225
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.090
<i>So, as a youth,  it's something like...</i>
<i>it was a life, like...</i>


226
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.730
<i>It was more than I ever had, so...</i>

227
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.250
<i>that's exactly what I wanted to do.</i>
<i>That's what I wanted to be.</i>


228
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.610
One, two.

229
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.090
One, two.

230
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.690
Some people say,

231
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.770
"Guns don't kill people.
People kill people."


232
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.450
I talked to a guy who recently had
a very interesting argument.


233
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.250
He said, "There is a demon
living in this pistol."


234
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.210
My thing with the gun. 
When I shot...

235
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.570
I don't know about this demon,
but I get high.


236
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.490
I mean, your adrenaline comes up...

237
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.770
so high, it's like floatin'.

238
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.010
When you're shootin' behind that gun...

239
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.330
You can't even...  You really
don't even realize what you're doin'.


240
00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.490
It's almost if you smoked some... leaf.

241
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.810
Smoked some PCP or somethin'.

242
00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.090
Just for that split second,
or whatever how long you get,


243
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.890
you get high.

244
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.090
And the more you get high,
it becomes an addiction.


245
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.730
And that's one of the worst addictions
I could've probably ever picked up.


246
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.130
Was the addiction of shootin' a gun.

247
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.050
Threat!

248
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.450
Scan and assess. Holster!

249
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.850
Turn to the left! 
Turn ot the left!

250
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.530
On "threat," we're gonna step forward
with our left foot.


251
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.810
Shooter ready?

252
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.410
Threat!

253
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.730
Scan and assess. Holster!

254
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.210
Every day, I carry a Glock 19.
And that gun is actually…


255
00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.650
feels to me like
an extension of my body.

256
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.530
I carry it...

257
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.930
regularly. Without it on,
I feel naked. It's...


258
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.090
so comfortable to me to have it on,
and know that it's there.


259
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.370
And I've carried for so long, that…

260
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.570
without it it just feels uncomfortable.

261
00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.610
Sometimes, even when I would sit down
on the couch next to my husband,


262
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.450
he would wrap his arm around me and say,
"You still have your gun on."


263
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.850
And I'm like, "I forget that it's there,
because it's always there."


264
00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.650
It's there 24 hours a day.

265
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.890
Now over top with your hand
just like I showed you.


266
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.170
You don't wanna put your pinkies near
this ejection port cause it'll pinch you.


267
00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.130
-So, I'm back here?
-Yup. And push and pull. And let it go.


268
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.010
-Push what?
-Push the...


269
00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.290
-Push this?
-the receiver. the lower part of the gun.


270
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.290
And pull the slide.

271
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.490
Let it go.

272
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:18.610
Perfect.

273
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.450
-Okay.
-All right. Now it's loaded.


274
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.050
-Okay.
-It's a round chambered.


275
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.770
All right.
Get that hand high on the back strap.


276
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.090
Now, don't try to look for those sights
with your head. You're doing that.


277
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.890
-Okay.
-Extend your arms out.


278
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.530
Bend at the waist. 
Lock your arms.

279
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.290
Bring 'em in. All right.
Now, bring the gun to your eyes.


280
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.490
I believe that the hand gun
levels the playing field


281
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.410
between a five-foot two woman,

282
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.330
who weighs 115 pounds,

283
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:53.850
against a man that's 300 pounds
and on drugs of some sort,


284
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.410
and his intention is to rape, or kill,
or maim her.


285
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.570
That levels the playing field.
It gives her that...


286
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.090
empowerment to know
that she can stop him from doing that.


287
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.170
Whenever you're ready.
Just put pressure, pressure, pressure--


288
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.170
Focus only on the green dot and put
pressure on the trigger until it breaks.


289
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.330
Finger off the trigger.

290
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.330
Relax your gun and bring it
into your body. And look at your target.


291
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.810
-Okay. That's not so good, is it?
-What?


292
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.610
-Yes, it is. You're in the red dot.
-Okay.


293
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.930
<i>I had an 82-year-old lady</i>
<i>who was a student of mine, and…</i>


294
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.450
<i>and, when her husband passed away,</i>

295
00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.730
<i>she'd always had her dog to alert her</i>
<i>if someone came to the door.</i>


296
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.650
<i>And when her dog passed away...</i>

297
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.330
<i>she decided that…</i>

298
00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.330
<i>she didn't wanna get another dog, 'cause</i>
<i>she wanted to go travel a little bit.</i>


299
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.450
<i>So, instead of getting another dog,</i>
<i>she wanted to learn how to shoot a gun.</i>


300
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.450
<i>And I asked her if she would like</i>
<i>to just try to shoot my Glock.</i>


301
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.650
<i>And she said ,"If you think that I can</i>
<i>do it, then I'll give it a try."</i>


302
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.890
And she immediately went
and bought a Glock and…


303
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.050
she keeps it by her bedstand and…

304
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.650
carries it in her glove box
in her center console when she travels.


305
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.090
She's...

306
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.050
She feels safe again.
And that's a great feeling for me to know


307
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.290
that here this lady, as frail and elderly,

308
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.810
didn't feel like she could protect
herself. And now she can.


309
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:02.330
<i>Six, zero, six, just got...</i>
<i>for unit number Boy, One...</i>


310
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.130
<i>He's a gangster.</i>

311
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.330
<i>Yeah, I think Glock would begin to look</i>
<i>at the American market in the 1980s...</i>


312
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.730
<i>about the mid 1980s.</i>
<i>And then by the early 1990s,</i>


313
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.490
<i>had established itself</i>
<i>as quite successful.</i>


314
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.210
<i>Glock targeted law enforcement</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>


315
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.610
<i>And they targeted</i>
<i>the law enforcement successfully.</i>


316
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.890
<i>They were able to persuade</i>
<i>law enforcement agencies...</i>


317
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.810
<i>increasingly, that they should have</i>

318
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.810
<i>high-capacity semi-automatic pistols</i>
<i>which were a better firearm </i>


319
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.090
<i>for the law enforcement purposes</i>
<i>than the old-fashioned revolver.</i>


320
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.730
<i>But once you sold a gun</i>
<i>to a law enforcement agency,</i>


321
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.650
<i>the gun itself can last</i>
<i>20, 30, 40, 50 years.</i>


322
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.250
<i>But that's not what a manufacturer wants</i>
<i>to do. They wanna sell more guns.</i>


323
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.090
<i>So, in order to that,</i>

324
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.570
<i>Glock then began to sell</i>

325
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.490
<i>semi-automatic pistols in higher calibers.</i>

326
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.010
<i>It was a cycle of lethality.</i>

327
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.610
<i>In other words, the police would have</i>
<i>them, the criminals would have them,</i>


328
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.770
<i>then the police would say,</i>
<i>"We need a bigger caliber</i>


329
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.370
<i>to deal with the criminals."</i>
<i>So it's an endless spiral.</i>


330
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.930
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>Glock ever really thought that...</i>


331
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.130
<i>selling to law enforcement is</i>
<i>the endgame of their marketing.</i>


332
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.410
<i>The endgame of their marketing is</i>
<i>the much larger civilian population.</i>


333
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.970
OK, give us a little tour of the guns
in your house?


334
00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:09.970
Okay.

335
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:15.130
-The places how you store them?
-I will show you one… first safe.


336
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.330
It's a little unorganized at the moment.

337
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.930
But we have everything locked up.

338
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.970
There's probably…

339
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.050
forty to fifty guns in this safe.

340
00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.370
There's another one.

341
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:57.210
This safe is also a little unorganized
but it has a lot of...


342
00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.850
my father's hunting weapons in it.

343
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.490
This is one of the safes
that I keep my handguns in.


344
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.250
There's probably...

345
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.370
fifty to sixty guns in this safe also.

346
00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.250
I'll just show you-- I like
when different manufacturers do


347
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.490
designs on...

348
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.290
on different stuff. Like this one's
labeled "thunder and lightning."


349
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:30.410
And I also like

350
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.690
25th anniversary.
I like collecting different models that...


351
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.250
nobody else has.

352
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.530
So, how many Glocks do you own?

353
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.250
That's a good question.

354
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.970
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

355
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.810
About 18 Glocks.

356
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.170
Eighteen different models.

357
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.890
<i>-She did that easy!</i>
-Finger straight.


358
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:09.250
Some people do it different.

359
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.330
-Ready?
-Whenever you are.


360
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.410
Put your green dot right in the middle
of your front sight and focus on...


361
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.810
Right in the middle of the target.
And focus on your front sight.


362
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.410
Slow and…

363
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:25.970
Perfect.

364
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.730
So, can you explain
to me what it means?

365
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.250
Well, it's a picture of a Glock
in front of our...


366
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.970
our Constitution.

367
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:46.210
And...

368
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.770
the significance, of course,
is our Second Amendment.


369
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.730
The purpose the Second Amendment
was created for


370
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.170
was to protect us from the government.
And that's why...


371
00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.650
our Constitution starts
with "We, the people."


372
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.210
Not with...

373
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:06.610
"The subjects" or…"We, the government."
It's with "We, the people," and part of…


374
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.890
Before they would ratify the Constitution,
they created the Bill of Rights…


375
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:14.410
giving us...

376
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.610
number one, our freedom
of speech and religion and…


377
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.850
then number two, our right to bear arms.

378
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.890
And it was to protect us from…

379
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:25.570
tyranny.

380
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.810
And so,

381
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.250
the picture of the Glock
in front of the Bill of Rights


382
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.930
that's is... is... its total significance.

383
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.810
Do you think it's necessary to have
something to protect yourself with?


384
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.370
Yeah. I believe it's everybody's right

385
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.410
to have something
to protect themselves with.


386
00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:45.490
I mean...

387
00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.250
if you don't have something
to protect yourself with…


388
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.130
why, what's the point, you know,

389
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.650
if somebody going in and threatening you,
what's the point


390
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.090
of continuing on with your life?
You'd always be afraid of


391
00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.930
"OK, this person said
they're gonna hurt me, so...


392
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.090
I'm not gonna go to this place anymore,
I'm not gonna go that place anymore."


393
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.690
Whereas if you have a means
to defend yourself,


394
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:11.330
if, you know, the situation arises,
it's best to...


395
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.770
be able to defend yourself.
Everybody has a right to defend themself.


396
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.370
I'd rather have the
gun and not need it.

397
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.290
You know, it gives you…
not necessary a sense of…


398
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.210
Sort of like, like
a sense of less fear.

399
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.290
Like, I know in situations, like,
when I go on vacation to other states,


400
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:32.410
there's always that paranoia
of, "I know I don't have a gun."


401
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.530
So, I am extremely cautious
about the area.


402
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.890
Like, I won't go to certain areas

403
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:41.010
that I know there was crime or anything
like that. I'll definitely avoid them.


404
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.650
Almost, like, avoiding a plague, you know.

405
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.170
I choose to avoid those situations.

406
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:48.650
Jab, jab.

407
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.050
Good job. Do it again.

408
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.050
Do it again.

409
00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:54.970
One, two.

410
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.610
Fall.

411
00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.450
Fall.

412
00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.610
You know what happen
when you goin' so fast?


413
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.570
This is you startin' to do.

414
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.530
Your hands goin' like this.
I want you do to do it one,


415
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.010
turn. Two, turn. Three, turn. Four, turn.

416
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.370
-One, two.
-Back.


417
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.770
-One, two.
-Back.


418
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.450
-One, two.
-Forward.


419
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.010
-One, two.
-Forward.


420
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:19.450
-One, two.
-Forward.


421
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.850
-One, two.
-Back.


422
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.450
-One, two.
-Back.


423
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.970
-One, two.
-Back.


424
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.610
-One, two.
-Back.


425
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:31.090
<i>When you have a poverty-stricken</i>
<i>community, comes desperation.</i>


426
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:32.810
<i>-One, two.</i>
<i>-Forward.</i>


427
00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.130
<i>-One, two.</i>

428
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.130
<i>One, two.</i>

429
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.490
<i>Desperation for survival.</i>

430
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.130
Same thing. Right here.

431
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.810
<i>Some people call this "Chiraq"</i>

432
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.650
<i>because of the capacity of the violence</i>
<i>is compared to Iraq.</i>


433
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:54.570
<i>So, Chicago is basically known as "Chiraq"</i>
<i>because of it's a warzone.</i>


434
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.530
You can see me?

435
00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:15.250
<i>People prey on each other.</i>
<i>That's what the drug selling's all about.</i>


436
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:17.730
<i>Preying off your own people.</i>

437
00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.970
<i>Killin' people off. But,</i>

438
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.410
<i>like I said, if you don't know better,</i>

439
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.010
<i>how can you do better?</i>

440
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.250
<i>Well, I lost my friend to gun violence.</i>

441
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:43.850
<i>It was...</i>

442
00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.050
1996.

443
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.810
This was my best friend.

444
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.130
You know, me and him from...
He moved here when I was in third grade.


445
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.570
And we been like this...

446
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.930
With those same vice lord laws
that we followed.


447
00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.690
That was us, you know.
Men's fought for the same cause.


448
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.090
Everything we did.
It was like a part of me.


449
00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.490
<i>As he was standin' out there,</i>
<i>while they were sellin' drugs.</i>


450
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.810
<i>And he all... He had gun... He had</i>
<i>a gun on him at the time.</i>


451
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.370
<i>And somebody came from behind</i>
<i>and shot him in the head.</i>


452
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.730
<i>Shot him in the neck, his heart.</i>

453
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.410
<i>Just multiple times,</i>
<i>just shot his body up.</i>


454
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.570
<i>He never made to see 20.</i>

455
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.330
<i>That's what made me realize that...</i>

456
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.330
<i>life wasn't a game.</i>

457
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.930
<i>Human life wants to be valued.</i>

458
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.010
<i>At the same time,</i>

459
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.650
<i>we were also part of the violence,</i>
<i>because...</i>


460
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.250
<i>Walter was hard crook, criminal.</i>

461
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.850
<i>And I was, too.</i>

462
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.490
<i>I know, crying tears.</i>
<i>Walter can never come back.</i>


463
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.730
There's somethin' was just tellin' me

464
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:09.170
to kill every person
that you can possibly think of.


465
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.330
But then I'm sayin',
"That's a lot of people."


466
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.010
We have many enemies.

467
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:18.250
And right before I was about to get up,
I just heard a voice.


468
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.810
It was telling me,
"No, put the gun down."

469
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.690
And I'm... I was…

470
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:26.930
I was like, "Am I trippin'?"

471
00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.890
It was like, "Put the gun down."

472
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.890
I just started cryin'
even while I said, "I can't, I can't."


473
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.330
It was like, "You can."

474
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.370
"I can't." "You can."
"I can't." "You can."


475
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.570
And it's like I felt something touch
my shoulders as I was crying'.


476
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:45.130
And it said,
"Everything is gonna be all right."


477
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.450
Thank you.

478
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.530
<i>Chicago.</i>

479
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.090
<i>4th of July, 2015.</i>

480
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:21.610
<i>Independence Day.</i>

481
00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.290
<i>Year after year,</i>
<i>the annual day of celebration</i>


482
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.370
<i>is one</i>
<i>of the bloodiest on Chicago streets.</i>


483
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.770
<i>Tonight's tally for gun violence:</i>

484
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.370
<i>in eight hours, ten dead, 55 wounded.</i>

485
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.930
<i>Both sides of the law reach</i>
<i>for the same weapon.</i>


486
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.530
This is a .40 caliber Glock.

487
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:58.970
You know, model 23, 4...
generation 4, .40 caliber.


488
00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.330
With a 12-round magazine.

489
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.970
There is a 19. 
Nine millimeter.

490
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.250
Glock.

491
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:12.130
This is also popular police gun?

492
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.930
Oh, yes, yes.
This is real popular. Almost…


493
00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.210
I'd say 60% of the Chicago Police
Department have it,


494
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.970
and all new people coming
at the Police Department have this gun.


495
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.850
You know, and it's a selling point
for the manufacturer.


496
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.610
Hey, police, army members use it.

497
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:28.250
So, when a shooter says,
"Hey, well, police, army use it.


498
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.130
Well, I wanna  be, you know
what I mean, the police and army, too."


499
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.930
So, normally, at this point,
I'd make a joke,


500
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.370
that this must be good news,

501
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:52.530
because there's a lot of people
standing up here.


502
00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.770
But that couldn't be the furthest thing
from the truth.


503
00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.810
We come here today...

504
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.170
outraged and saddened...

505
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.970
by the amount of gun violence
that has plagued our city. Particularly,


506
00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.450
over the last 24 hours.

507
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:10.290
And again, taken a life
of another innocent child.


508
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.650
While we normally wait
until the conclusion of a weekend


509
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.370
to release
official enforcement statistics,


510
00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.330
I felt compelled
to call you all together here,


511
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.250
now, to explain to you

512
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:25.490
what the Chicago Police Department,
in our community, is up against


513
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.890
and how aggressively
we are fighting this problem.


514
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:32.650
Every one of these firearms is
an odd confrontation with a criminal.


515
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:37.690
Every one of these firerarms puts
our officers and the community in danger.


516
00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:40.610
Maybe we'll take another 10,000 guns
off the street


517
00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:44.170
and another 10,000 will fill up
that illegal market the next day.


518
00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.970
-Yes?
-So, what's the problem you think?


519
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.410
What is the problem?
Come on, you know the answer.


520
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.530
You know all the answers to that.

521
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:54.770
You know the answers to that.
This is about the gun lobby.


522
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:28.930
My baby was seven,
was seven years old. Seven.


523
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.010
He hadn't lived.

524
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.330
He wanted to be somebody.

525
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.450
It was violence that took that
away from me.


526
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.570
I don't know where to go

527
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.690
<i>There is power</i>

528
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:54.890

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.690

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.490

<i>Hear the chains</i>

534
00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:18.050
<i>I hear the chains falling</i>

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.450
<i>I hear the chains falling</i>

536
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.010

537
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.410
<i>I hear the chains falling</i>

538

539

540

557
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.170
NOT EVEN A NO COMMENT

558
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.770
<i>The Glock pistol,</i>
<i>named after its inventor,</i>


559
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.490
<i>is a semi-automatic,</i>
<i>18-round, nine-millimeter pistol.</i>


560
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:59.570
<i>Firing tests show that the new army pistol</i>
<i>is faster and more accurate</i>


561
00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.090
<i>than any other handgun.</i>

562
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.810
<i>Designed to meet</i>
<i>the highest safety standards,</i>


563
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:10.050
<i>it is manufactured by a small company</i>
<i>in Deutsch-Wagram.</i>


564
00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.930
<i>From CEO to cleaning lady,</i>
<i>only 20 people work here.</i>


565
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:17.890
<i>The plant previously made</i>
<i>machine-gun belts,</i>


566
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.250
<i>spades, made of plastic, like the pistol,</i>

567
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.130
<i>and combat knives</i>
<i>for both army and private use.</i>


568
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:26.330
<i>The frame, grip,</i>

569
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:30.450
<i>trigger and other important</i>
<i>parts of the Glock are made of plastic.</i>


570
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.490
<i>Only its barrel and breech</i>

571
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:36.970
<i>are of tempered steel.</i>
<i>It can be disassembled in a minute.</i>


572
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:41.610
<i>Its innovative design sparked</i>
<i>international</i>


573
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:43.170
<i>and local media interest.</i>

574
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.730
<i>The Glock is hailed as a super-pistol</i>

575
00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.730
<i>and an Austrian technological sensation.</i>

576
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.170
<i>The Austrian army,</i>

577
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.170
<i>which is still equipped</i>
<i>with pistols from WWII,</i>


578
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.370
<i>the German P38 and the American Colt,</i>

579
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.770
<i>is really interested in the new weapon.</i>

580
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:05.490
<i>The army is inviting bids</i>
<i>for an initial order of 25,000 guns,</i>


581
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.970
<i>final decision to be made in October.</i>

582
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.370
<i>Civilian collectors and marksmen</i>
<i>will have to wait patiently.</i>


583
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:16.410
<i>The Glock pistol will be commercially</i>
<i>available only in the spring of 1983.</i>


584
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.530
<i>Are people concerned </i>

585
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:33.170
<i>that an international arms manufacturer</i>
<i>is based here?</i>


586
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.010
From what I can see, no. No.

587
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.570
Even those who know that Glock is here

588
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:50.210
aren't concerned
that it's an international arms maker.


589
00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.850
It's not an issue.

590
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:58.130
<i>US gun lovers worship the plant here</i>
<i>in Deutsch-Wagram like a shrine.</i>


591
00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.730
It's the first time I hear that.

592
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:05.010
<i>It's where the pistol was invented</i>
<i>in 1981. So that's not an issue?</i>


593
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.410
It's not an issue. 
Definitely not.

594
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.530
<i>Is the company an important employer here?</i>

595
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.850
Yes, yes.

596
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.610
That may be a reason why people

597
00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.450
don't think or talk about it much.

598
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:24.010
Jobs are desperately needed.

599
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:28.450
Unemployment is rising,
especially in our region.


600
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.450
People are happy to have a job.

601
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.570
And I can imagine that...

602
00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.890
I was never inside the factory...

603
00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:41.970
you don't make an entire Glock,
the whole gun, but just one part of it.


604
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.530
Right? Assembly stages are separate,

605
00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.050
or so I imagine.

606
00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:51.610
You don't think about it. What matters
is that you get your monthly check.


607
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.050
And that's it.

608
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.810
The gate is in the back,
it's usually open.


609
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.730
I don't know if
this is an access road.

610
00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.130
The section to the highway

611
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.050
was only recently repaired
and even paved, in fact.


612
00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:17.330
Whether parts...

613
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.930
are delivered here for production,

614
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.490
or whether they're shipped from here,
I don't know. But...


615
00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.090
that is...

616
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.010
the entrance to the Glock plant.

617
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.650
And here, this is the Jewish cemetery.

618
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.850
It's existed in Deutsch-Wagram
for many years.


619
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:44.730
The Jewish cemetery is now surrounded
by the concrete walls


620
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.530
of Glock, which purchased the entire site.

621
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.890
Apparently there's an agreement

622
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.450
whereby the Glock company looks
after the Jewish cemetery.


623
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.490
That may just be
a rumor, I don't know.

624
00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:00.730
The fact is, the cemetery

625
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.970
hasn't been cared for,

626
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.170
which is a black mark on the municipality.

627
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.290
Besides, this is the history.
History of the weapons,


628
00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.330
the Jewish cemetery.

629
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:23.730
Nobody knows anything or talks about it.
They all try to forget.

<i>In Austria, our research</i>

638
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.650
Paul, you were a corporate lawyer
at Glock?


639
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.090
Yes.

640
00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.330
What would you have
done to people like us

641
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.930
going around,
asking tricky questions about the company?


642
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.130
You wouldn't have gotten
anywhere near the company.


643
00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.330
It's as simple as that.
You wouldn't have gotten near the company


644
00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.570
and you wouldn't have gotten on the floor
of the shot show.


645
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.530
-Not even a "no comment"?
-No. I mean...


646
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.810
Chances are, you wouldn't have gotten
a lot of information.


647
00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.850
What was the policy of Glock
towards journalists in Austria?


648
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.930
Well, I know they never spoke to 'em.

649
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:22.530
But if...

650
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.450
somebody did have the audacity
to report the news,


651
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.850
you know, their policy was quite simple.

652
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.930
If his name appeared in print,
they got sued.


653

<i>Paul Januzzo began his career in 1991</i>

654
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.650
<i>and later rose to

655
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:47.730
<i>Bloomberg Businessweek called him</i>
<i>the embodiment of the US firearm industry.</i>


656
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:53.530
<i>Under him, Glock USA developed</i>
<i>from being a small, Austrian importer</i>


657
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.650
<i>to the market leader</i>
<i>of handguns in the USA.</i>


658
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:03.610
You know, I helped to shape Glock's image,
without a doubt.


659
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:07.850
You know, you don't have
to be Einstein to figure out


660
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.250
that, to the anti-gunners,

661
00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:13.570
being a law enforcement equipment company

662
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:17.130
is more palatable to their sensibilities

663
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.210
than being a firearms company.

664
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:24.490
Same thing, but if you can cast yourself
as a law enforcement equipment company,


665
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:28.010
then you're on the side of,
you know, righteousness and good,


666
00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.450
as opposed to being
a big, bad, evil gun company.


667

<i>In central Texas, scenes from a massacre.</i>

668
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.410
<i>The deadliest mass-shooting</i>
<i>in American history.</i>


669
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.330
<i>This is the CBS evening news.</i>
<i>Dan Rather reporting.</i>


670
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:47.170
Good evening. A man went on a bloody
rampage in central Texas today.


671
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.450
He drove a truck into a cafeteria,

672
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:51.930
opened fire on the crowd inside,

673
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.810
and then committed suicide.

674
00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:58.010
The first time Glock was ever used
in a mass-shooting,


675
00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:59.570
to my knowledge anyway,

676
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.410
was in Killeen, Texas.

677
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:06.290
And there was a guy
that walked into a cafe, a diner,


678
00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:08.050
whatever, in Killeen, Texas.

679
00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:11.730
And I don't know how many people
he shot, but... a lot.


680
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.410
And...

681
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.370
Usually, the company
would have hidden from that.


682
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:20.450
And this was...

683
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.050
This was, really, I think
about four months after I got there.


684
00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.850
So, I was still getting my feet wet.

685
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:28.770
But instead of hiding from the news,

686
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.250
my recommendation to the company
at that point in time


687
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:32.770
was to get in front of it.

688
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.570
And I called a buddy of mine,
who was a media specialist,


689
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.570
and we set up a press conference

690
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:40.930
to talk to the press
about what happened.


691
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:44.050
And to, like I said,
to try to get in front of it.


692
00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:47.210
But the reality is, you know,

693
00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:52.250
as horrible as it may sound,
people see that and...


694
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:57.370
and once they look past
the horrific circumstances,


695
00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.370
the next thing, apparently,
that occurs to 'em is that it worked.


696
00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:04.250
So, it... As... You know,

697
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.690
it's not the kind of marketing
anybody wants.


698
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.250
But, unfortunately, it works.

699
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.410
<i>Paul Januzzo was released from jail</i>
<i>a few months before this interview.</i>


700
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:29.090
<i>In 2009, he was convicted</i>
<i>of embezzling funds from Glock.</i>


701
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:37.290
<i>He avoided arrest by fleeing to Mexico</i>
<i>and was later arrested in the Netherlands.</i>


702
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:44.130
<i>After four years in custody, his sentence</i>
<i>was overturned due to procedural errors.</i>


703
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:48.330
<i>Januzzo sees himself</i>
<i>as the victim of a conspiracy</i>


704

<i>and is now suing Glock.</i>

705
00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.770
When I left Gaston Glock
and the Glock company,


706
00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.930
in... on February 3rd, 2003,

707
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:03.890
it wasn't exactly
text book-style termination.


708
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:09.090
Definitely not one that Dale Carnegie
would recommend in one of his courses.


709
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:10.650
It was a huge argument.

710
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.850
It was right after the shot show
that I had mentioned before.


711
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.650
I was not particularly happy with him.

712
00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:18.410
So, I called him up and told him

713
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.330
I was gonna meet him at his house
before he came into the office that day.


714
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.370
And I drove over, and I quit.

715
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:25.690
And I told him why I was quitting.

716
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.970
Basically told him he disgusted me.

717
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.930
And he went and got a gun.

718
00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.610
I could hear him
load it in his room

719
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.010
before he came back in
and it was stuck into his belt.


720
00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.210
Part of our argument was, I told him
if he touched his pistol again,


721
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.250
I was gonna shove it so far up his ass
he was gonna blow his tonsils off.


722
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.130
And, you know, that was my termination.
Not good.


723
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:52.810
But on top of that, I had the fact
that I knew way too much,


724
00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:56.770
because when we did
the investigation for Glock,


725
00:49:57.010 --> 00:49:59.330
into his trustee,

726
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:03.610
we uncovered what can only
be described as massive tax fraud


727
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.130
to the tune of, I think a hundre--
at least 80 million dollars,


728
00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.930
potentially a hundred million dollars

729
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.770
that he had siphoned off
the worldwide corporation


730
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.170
via shell corporations and phoney bills

731
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:16.970
and money laundering.

732
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:21.690
So, we had... There's two strikes.
The third strike


733
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:25.290
was that I was dating Monika
and eventually married her.


734
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:29.210
And he had been pursuing her since 1995.

735
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.970
And number four, you know,

736
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:35.010
it was almost a de rigueur in Glock.

737
00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:37.850
You can... It's like the Mafia.
You can join,


738
00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:39.930
but it's a capital offense to leave.

739
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.450
<i>Gaston Glock...</i>

740
00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:45.850
<i>the man behind the gun.</i>

741
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.210
Who owns a Glock?

742
00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:52.650
You guys, a lot of you
watching the channel


743
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:56.210
own a Glock, want a Glock,
or have shot a Glock in the past.


744
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.090
Boy, this gun has changed
the firearm industry


745
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.130
in a huge way for the better.

746
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:06.890
And, I gotta tell you,
this video is all about Gaston Glock,


747
00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:10.090
the man and the history behind

748
00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:14.290
how he created the empire
that we now know as Glock.


749
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.890
Gaston's still alive right now.
Doin' real well.


750
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.170
He's 83. He's got a 31-year-old wife,
we're gonna talk about that.


751
00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:22.890
She's smokin' hot.

752
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:28.130
But did you guys realize that 1999...

753
00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:33.330
someone tried messin' with Gaston?
And you don't mess with Gaston Glock!


754
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:37.050
His best friend, his business associate...

755
00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:43.250
messed with him. You know what he did?
He tried to have Gaston assassinated.


756
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.250
Have you talked to him?

757
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.770
He's not too fond of the press.

758
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.090
Well...

759
00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:25.530
How much liability insurance do you have,
when the lawsuits start?


760
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:30.130
That's his standard MO.
Mention his name and he sues you.


761
00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:33.490
Anyway.

762
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:36.370
It was a partnership.

763
00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.210
But...

764
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:41.610
the courts decided otherwise.

765
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:45.250
<i>You're only referred to as a trustee.</i>

766
00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:47.890
By him, yes.

767
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:54.690
<i>But in fact you spent 15 years</i>
<i>helping to build the Glock empire.</i>


768
00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:00.650
Not just build it.
I also helped to run it.


769
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:02.290
I was...

770
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.210
in Vienna three times a month

771
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.290
or in Klagenfurt.

772
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:10.610
Whenever there was a problem,

773
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.730
"Mr. Ewert, we need you.

774
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:18.490
Only you can break it to him."
I had to deliver all the bad news.


775
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.090
He couldn't fire me.

776
00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.370
Everyone knew that.

777
00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:29.170
<i>How did your relationship change</i>
<i>over time?</i>


778
00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:32.130
<i>You met when the pistol was still--</i>

779
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:35.850
The relationship was
always the same, always good.


780
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.850
It changed...

781
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:41.170
on the day he
was attacked with a hammer.

782
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:47.970
<i>An underground car park in Luxemburg.</i>

783
00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:54.170
<i>On July 27, 1999, three men meet here.</i>

784
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:56.650
<i>Gaston Glock,</i>

785
00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:58.890
<i>inventor and businessman,</i>

786
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:02.210
<i>his trustee, 
Charles Ewert,</i>

787
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:04.570
<i>nicknamed Panama Charly,</i>

788
00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:10.370
<i>and former French paratrooper</i>
<i>and pro wrestler, Jacques Pêcheur,</i>


789
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.730
<i>nom de guerre, 
Spartacus.</i>

790
00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:18.650
<i>The meeting led to the revelation</i>
<i>of the Glock company's financial network.</i>


791
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:23.130
<i>And it marks the starting point</i>
<i>of numerous myths.</i>


792
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.530
<i>Did you try to kill Gaston Glock?</i>

793
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:40.770
If I wanted to have someone murdered,

794
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:44.890
it wouldn't be done in my presence
with a rubber hammer.


795
00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:47.890
I'm smarter than that.

796
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:53.930
I would've been sitting on a terrasse
with five notaries as witnesses


797
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:56.570
and his body would've been found
floating...


798
00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.170
somewhere off the coast of Latin America.

799
00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:04.210
That's just not my style.

800
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:05.490
I mean, you can call me...

801
00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:10.170
You can say, "That bastard,"
"He's a lush,"


802
00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:15.650
"He cons people, cheats,
launders money." Whatever.


803
00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:18.410
But murder?

804
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.130
No one would believe you.

805
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:32.570
So, Charles Ewert and Gaston Glock,
on the 27th July, 1999,


806
00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:35.090
they were riding by car,
coming from the airport.


807
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:36.730
They came down this ramp.

808
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:40.250
And Charles Ewert stopped his car,

809
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:42.530
asked Gaston Glock to come out of the car,

810
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:46.130
and went backwards to park
next to the wall.


811
00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:48.130
So, Gaston Glock was out first.

812
00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:50.170
Charles Ewert came out.

813
00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:54.650
And they both went in the direction
of the staircase to go upstairs.


814
00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:01.370
So, Charles took out his key

815
00:56:01.610 --> 00:56:03.850
and put the key in the key hole.

816
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:07.170
At that moment, 
Gaston Glock saw

817
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.170
a nice collection car, a Morgan,

818
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:11.890
and said to Charles,

819
00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:15.530
"I believe this is your car, isn't it?
Or your new car?"


820
00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:19.290
Charles said, "Yes."
And then Gaston Glock, by himself,


821
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:22.530
by his own initiative,
went in the direction of the car


822
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:24.570
and started looking at it.

823
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:27.890
And in that moment
Jacques Pêcheur arrived.


824
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:30.850
One thing is for sure.
Pêcheur came from here.


825
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:35.290
He had a hammer
made of plastic in his hand.


826
00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:38.530
The kind of hammer you use for tiling.

827
00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.090
When the attack started,

828
00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:43.210
Charles Ewert got scared,

829
00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:47.570
immediately pushed open the door,
with his key,


830
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.610
called the lift,

831
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:55.090
realized that the lift was busy,

832
00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:59.090
or was not coming down.
So, he decided to run up the stairs,


833
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.530
run out the door,

834
00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:03.410
and called his office.

835
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.890
His secretary answered.

836
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:09.530
He told them, "Call the police!
Gaston Glock is being attacked."


837
00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:20.970
We have one witness
who arrived on the crime scene...


838
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:26.570
after those 15 minutes.
And he found Pêcheur on top of Glock.


839
00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:31.210
But Glock did have
the plastic hammer in his hand,


840
00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:32.890
and Pêcheur was holding his hand.

841
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:42.370
While Gaston Glock was laying
on his bed at the hospital,


842
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:46.450
he asked the bankers to come,
Mr. Rusch and Mr. Maurer.


843
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:50.170
And immediately asked for his briefcase,

844
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:52.170
asked for the banker
to look in his briefcase.


845
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:55.530
There were powers of attorneys
in order to operate on the bank accounts


846
00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:59.090
of Reofin and other
various offshore companies.


847
00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:03.770
And immediate instructions were given
to empty some of those bank accounts.


848
00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:06.130
He tried to empty all, but...

849
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.610
one of the power of attorneys
was not drafted properly,


850
00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:11.970
so one of the bank accounts
was not emptied that day.


851
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:15.010
<i>So, just a few hours after the attack,</i>

852
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:17.010
<i>-a lot of money was transferred?</i>
-Yes.


853
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:18.370
<i>How much?</i>

854
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:22.650
We’re talking about
at least $35 million US dollars.


855
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:34.490
<i>Charles Ewert pioneered the setting up</i>
<i>of shell companies in tax havens.</i>


856
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:39.410
<i>Gaston Glock first contacted him in 1985.</i>

857
00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:43.890
<i>He needed help to expand</i>
<i>his weapons company.</i>


858
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.890
How can I start a venture without money?

859
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:58.130
By using...

860
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:02.250
the financial instruments
that existed then,


861
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:06.690
that today are frowned upon,
but that made Luxemburg the player it is.


862
00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:10.650
You create equity using...

863
00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:13.850
tax money that you haven't paid yet.

864
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:15.850
You know.

865
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:20.250
And then you reinvest it.

866
00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.490
That, basically,

867
00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:26.610
is the secret of his success.

868
00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:33.890
The problem is the pie wasn't shared.

869
00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:36.170
Or there'd never have been a problem.

870
00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:40.450
If he'd had his
share, and I'd had mine,

871
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:43.810
all good. But there was only one pot,

872
00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:45.970
and we both helped ourselves to it.

873
00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:48.210
<i>How big was the pot?</i>

874
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:50.490
Big.

875
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:53.850
You could've easily bought
a jet without...


876
00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:56.490
<i>Is there a ballpark figure?</i>

877
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.810
A three-digit million figure.

878
01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.250
No need to say more.

879
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:07.890
<i>But you'd have controlled</i>
<i>$70 or $80 million in bank accounts,</i>


880
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:10.570
<i>if Glock had died on that day.</i>

881
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:12.730
I controlled them anyway.

882
01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.330
I had control anyway.

883
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:30.690
<i>At the time of the interview,</i>
<i>Charles Ewert had spent 13 years in jail.</i>


884
01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:36.210
<i>He was found guilty</i>
<i>of ordering the murder of Gaston Glock.</i>


885
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.610
<i>Charles Ewert, too, sees himself</i>
<i>as a victim of conspiracy.</i>


886
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:49.890
<i>If you were to run into Gaston Glock,</i>

887
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.130
<i>would you have anything to say to him?</i>

888
01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:53.410
No.

889
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:56.210
A gesture, though.

890
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.010
It would be a message...

891
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.210
to tell him...

892
01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:10.770
You could kill him with a .22,

893
01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.770
to show that smaller calibers can do
the job.


894
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:18.210
Something that would be inconceivable
to him.


895
01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:22.490
He doesn't know
how the Mossad handled the terrorists


896
01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:25.570
behind the 1972 attack in Munich.

897
01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:32.290
They were all...

898
01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:34.210
liquidated...

899
01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.650
with .22s.

900
01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:43.570
All you need are exceptional marksmen.

901
01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:46.770
You don't hear a thing, though.

902
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:49.810
A .22 with a silencer.

903
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:51.810
That's all.

904
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.170
And on the street...

905
01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:59.170
Someone walking on the Kärntner<i></i>Straße.

906
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:03.170
You can shoot him from behind
and no one will hear a thing.


907
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:06.450
Or am I missing something? No, I mean...

908
01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.330
I don't think we'll ever meet again.

909
01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:23.210

926
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:55.770
Do you have flashbacks?

927
01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:57.570
Every day.

928
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:00.770
Flashbacks is a common,

929
01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:03.770
natural courtesy of my brain.

930
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.490
It comes and goes.

931
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.250
Sometimes more, sometimes less.

932
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:11.210
But it's always there.

933
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.650
To many, this is not a gorgeous view.
To me, it's the best.


934
01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:22.730
Nothing but open water ahead o' you
and then you see the lights.


935
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:25.290
Every light is a thought.

936
01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:27.970
You turn it into a pattern.

937
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:38.010
Well, this is my relaxation.
My beauty, shall I say.


938
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:46.410
I come out here whenever, just sit down
and relax or release my stress,


939
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:49.810
‘cause if if I'm lookin' at the water,
I could go over there, I could work out.


940
01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:53.010
I'd play handball, there's
a basketball court. I can run around.


941
01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:55.930
This is actually like a smaller track,
so you can run around as well.


942
01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:02.250
This is, at night time, a personal time.

943
01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:04.650
Normally, I don't bring people out here.
I don't...


944
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.410
wanna be with nobody.

945
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:10.450
I prefer being left alone
when I'm thinking and...


946
01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:14.370
or I'm in a state of mind
where I deem myself...


947
01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:17.210
unfit to be around other people,

948
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:20.050
or mentally unstable, shall I say.

949
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:23.890
And then I come here for a couple hours
and I go back like it was a normal day.


950
01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:27.010
Short and simple.

951
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.570
In September of '02,

952
01:06:52.290 --> 01:06:54.410
I was shipped out to Kentucky
for my training...


953
01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.130
as a scout, as infantry,

954
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:00.890
as a tank driver.

955
01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:06.370
We had different kinds of weapons,
that were being...


956
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:10.490
set up and transported around.
So, we had to test them.


957
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:20.570
After about three or four months
of all this special training...


958
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:25.770
already in my head, I already had it set
that I was goin' over for war.


959
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:32.850
Picked up the phone, called my wife,

960
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.890
my family, said, "I'm leaving.

961
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:37.210
I just wanna say goodbye. 
Love you guys.

962
01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:39.730
In case you don't hear from me
ever again," stuff like that.


963
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.970
We were originally supposed to come
in through Turkey,


964
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:48.330
but we came in through Baghdad.

965
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:58.050
I got attached to a special force unit

966
01:07:58.410 --> 01:07:59.810
in the green berets unit,<i></i>

967
01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:01.970
to run the black list.

968
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.250
December 13, 2003.

969
01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:45.050
Ad
-Dawr, Iraq. Operation Red Dawn.

970
01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:49.170
We been workin' on missions
on blacklist guys.


971
01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:51.610
Our missions all were

972
01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:55.050
well detailled, a little bit of goin' out
for several days and several nights,


973
01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:59.170
overwatching locations
to where these guys on the blacklist was.


974
01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.090
Especially number one was Saddam Hussein.

975
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:05.730
On this particular night,

976
01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:08.890
we were supposed
to raid the area in Ad-Dawr,


977
01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:14.210
where Saddam was. And how there was
once again no real guarantee he was there,


978
01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:18.370
'cause our intel, as we watched, we didn't
see much of anybody coming in and out.


979
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:22.850
We noticed the size of the hole.
The gap there was.


980
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:26.330
We had to pick the thinnest guy
to be able to go in there.


981
01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:28.530
But the one with the senior ranking.

982
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:30.530
Which wasn't me, either way.

983
01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.610
But unfortunately, commander comes over,

984
01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:36.770
"You, Cruz, you're gonna go in.

985
01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:39.410
Take off your flak vest
and make sure the guys are watching.


986
01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.970
I jumped into the hole,
followed by one of the other guys.


987
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.770
Already... Saddam Hussein
was already stunned in the corner.


988
01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:50.170
He was holdin' his AK-47 in his hand.

989
01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:53.290
And on the bed,
he had a Glock there.

990
01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:55.570
Everybody was trying to get their hands
on this Glock.


991
01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:02.010
Whatever trophy was caught
from his capture


992
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:05.090
was gonna go to the president
who put us out in Iraq.


993
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:07.410
That was a guarantee.

994
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.890
So whatever was brought back from Saddam,

995
01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:13.970
that was gonna be personal,
was gonna go to George W. Bush.


996
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.770
And when we got back to Texas,

997
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:19.570
they had the ceremony
where he was receiving the Glock.


998
01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:27.570
<i>We will not tire, we will not falter...</i>

999
01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:30.050
<i>Tonight we are a country</i>
<i>relating to danger.</i>


1000
01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:32.690
<i>We are called to defend freedom.</i>

1001
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:36.050
<i>I think about the families,</i>
<i>the children...</i>


1002
01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:41.570
<i>who carried out yesterday</i>
<i>against our country...</i>


1003
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:43.410
<i>They were acts of war.</i>

1004
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:49.090
So the visitor just got done learning
all about the creation of the Patriot Act,


1005
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.930
the creation of the Department
of Homeland Security,


1006
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:54.610
Iraq's first democratic election.

1007
01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:57.210
And now they get to learn
about the Bush doctrine.


1008
01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:01.050
The Bush doctrine is simply four ideals

1009
01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:05.210
that completely describe why we are
fighting a global war on terrorism.


1010
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:07.210
"Take the fight to the enemy."

1011
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.690
"Make no distinction between terrorists
and the nations that harbor them."


1012
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:14.610
"Confront threats
before they fully emerge."


1013
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:16.050
And "Advance freedom."

1014
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:20.370
Right there, those four thoughts
completely summarize


1015
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.250
what this entire portion of museum
is all about.


1016
01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:25.370
Advancing freedom,

1017
01:11:25.690 --> 01:11:27.210
spreading democracy,

1018
01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.650
fighting terror.

1019
01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:31.490
Simply put, in four different statements.

1020
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:34.090
Now, when the visitor is in this section,

1021
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:37.410
there is an artifact
that they may not even know it exists.


1022
01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:40.970
So when they come through here,
they see this big glass stanchion.


1023
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:44.650
They notice the giant arrow, they notice
the shield, they notice the poster


1024
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:48.450
and then all of a sudden,
right there in the middle of the stanchion


1025
01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:49.890
there's a Glock.

1026
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:53.370
Now, they're not quite sure who the Glock
belongs to, so they start to read.


1027
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:56.290
And they notice that this was the pistol

1028
01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:58.970
that Saddam Hussein had on his person

1029
01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:01.170
when Special Forces captured him

1030
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:02.850
in that spider hole.

1031
01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:05.970
Course, after they detained him,
they took that pistol,


1032
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:09.730
they framed it and they said,
"Mr. President,


1033
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:13.730
right here you have
Saddam Hussein's nine-millimeter Glock."


1034
01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:16.130
We put it on display.

1035
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:19.570
Why do we put artifacts like this
on display? Well, this


1036
01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.410
is an important part of the narrative.

1037
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:25.530
This symbolizes the point where Iraq

1038
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:29.130
was underneath the thumb of a dictator.

1039
01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:33.490
And now had the opportunity
to become a democratic nation.


1040
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.770
While some may only
see it as a Glock,

1041
01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:40.650
this is one of the most important
historical artifacts that we have


1042
01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:42.010
because of the symbolism.

1043
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:29.130
Here's some pictures that I have.
Here's the original of that one.


1044
01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:34.650
When I first came back to see my child
and everybody else on R&R.


1045
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:38.330
everybody thought that I was locked up
a long time, or on crack, or I was dying,


1046
01:13:38.410 --> 01:13:39.490
'cause of how skinny I was.

1047
01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:43.250
I went from being a 200-plus-poiund guy
that lifted weights and played football


1048
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:45.450
to bein' 125 pound.

1049
01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:49.370
So, that was that struggle.

1050
01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:57.450
You see the colorations on my hand,
they start from sandstorms,


1051
01:13:57.930 --> 01:14:00.770
and burns from fires and RPG attacks.

1052
01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:10.050
My memories…

1053
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:13.370
Then goes the bastard there.

1054
01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.410
See on the bottom of this,

1055
01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:26.370
"Captured Saddam Hussein,

1056
01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:31.690
It's a... It's definitely a day
you don't forget.


1057
01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:38.570
And I have other things, ARCOMs and stuff
like that, I left all that in Jersey.


1058
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:41.250
Presidential award.

1059
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.250
Garbage.

1060
01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.810
All this paper. I keep sayin' on people
all these papers is just garbage.


1061
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:52.970
It's waste o' trees.

1062
01:14:57.730 --> 01:14:59.130
It's a waste o' trees.

1063
01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:14.730
So you guys still got factories out there
building the...


1064
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:16.490
these weapons?

1065
01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:19.130
How rapid are they doin' it, you know?

1066
01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:22.530
<i>I think every few minutes. I mean,</i>
<i>it takes only probably a few minutes</i>


1067
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:23.850
<i>to make a Glock. </i>

1068
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:27.490
<i>-It's, you know, made out of plastic.</i>
-Yeah.


1069
01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.050
<i>So...</i>

1070
01:15:29.770 --> 01:15:31.250
<i>Doesn't cost anything.</i>

1071
01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:34.370
It'll cost you your life, eventually.

1072
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:36.970
Remember that one.

1073
01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:39.490
Nothing in this world is free.

1074
01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:42.930
That's what I...
Who was I tellin' that yesterday to?


1075
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:45.850
That, "No, but it's free."
I said, "Nothing in this world is free."


1076
01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:48.130
No matter how you look at it.

1077
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:50.050
It could be handed,
you could have found it,


1078
01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.210
some way somehow you're gonna pay
in return for it.


1079
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.850
In my true, honest words,
karma is a bitch.


1080
01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:00.330
I've lived it.

1081
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.970
I've done wrong things
and wrong things have been done to me.


1082
01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:08.290
I live by this, karma…

1083
01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:11.010
It will come back around and bite you.

1084
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:14.770
And it may not be
as soon as you think,

1085
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:17.130
but it's definitely gonna catch up to you.

1086
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.250
<i>9/11 and the ensuing War on Terror</i>

1087
01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:51.890
<i>created a gold rush</i>
<i>for arms manufacturers.</i>


1088
01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:58.610
<i>After the US invasion of Iraq,</i>
<i>Iraqi security services were disbanded.</i>


1089
01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:02.850
<i>Police officers left their posts</i>
<i>with their weapons.</i>


1090
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:09.770
<i>The US interim government</i>
<i>ordered Glocks from Austria</i>


1091
01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:13.650
<i>to arm the new Iraqi security forces.</i>

1092
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.370
<i>The deal was controversial.</i>

1093
01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:20.130
<i>Can a neutral country</i>
<i>ship arms to war zones?</i>


1094
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:24.010
<i>Glock threatened</i>
<i>to move production abroad</i>


1095
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:26.530
<i>unless export licenses were granted.</i>

1096
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:36.290
<i>The Ministry of Commerce relented</i>

1097
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:39.290
<i>and allowed the arms shipments,</i>
<i>arguing that,</i>


1098
01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:45.210
<i>"Pursuant to the Foreign Trade Law,</i>
<i>arms shipments are only approved</i>


1099
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:47.730
<i>when there are no grounds to believe</i>

1100
01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:51.210
<i>that the arms will end up</i>
<i>in terrorist hands."</i>


1101
01:18:24.970 --> 01:18:29.450
Don't tell him too much.
Give short answers.


1102
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:34.890
When the Americans equipped us
with these Glocks,


1103
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:40.930
they also trained us to disassemble
and clean them.


1104
01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:47.410
They took us to the firing range
and practiced shooting with us.


1105
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:54.130
It's certainly a good pistol
to have on you.


1106
01:18:56.290 --> 01:19:01.450
Unfortunately we don't have enough Glocks
for all our men.


1107
01:19:01.650 --> 01:19:06.850
Because for a policeman,
a Glock is really necessary.


1108
01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:10.370
We have enough Kalashnikovs,

1109
01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:14.450
but they're not suited to daily use,

1110
01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:17.490
whereas for policemen Glocks
are very practical. So, I'm still short.


1111
01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:22.170
For example,
I have 750 police officers here,


1112
01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:24.010
and we've been sent only 100 Glocks.

1113
01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:31.290
<i>So you have some information</i>
<i>whether ISIS is using Glocks as well?</i>


1114
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:34.450
<i>Do you information</i>

1115
01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:40.410
<i>whether ISIS is using Glocks as well?</i>

1116
01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:43.010
I am pretty sure they can get Glocks,

1117
01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:45.210
because there are places where to buy.

1118
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:47.210
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty sure they can, you know,</i>

1119
01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:52.930
<i>get Glocks because there are some places</i>
<i>they could sell Glocks. It's easy to get.</i>


1120
01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:59.570
<i>Salaam
-Alaikum.</i>

1121
01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:04.250
Dear brothers, especially brothers,
and also sisters.


1122
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:09.650
I am in the land of jihad at the moment
with a Glock 19.


1123
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:13.530
Yeah? Most of you playboy guys
ain't seen this yet.


1124
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:16.810
I've got a box of ammunition

1125
01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:20.530
from our so-called brothers,
the Free Syrian Army.


1126
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:24.250
What I was come to do here,

1127
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:27.290
it's what's prescribed

1128
01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:30.530
to us as Muslim men.

1129
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:33.410
So while you are sitting
down on the corner,


1130
01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:35.090
on a block,

1131
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:37.330
you know, chasing that squealer,

1132
01:20:37.690 --> 01:20:39.890
chasing that honey that walks past,

1133
01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:42.450
with the low batties on,

1134
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:45.570
-with your hands down your trousers...
<i>-Getting semis.</i>


1135
01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:47.810
...getting semis...
we're busting semis actually.


1136
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:51.690
But what really is, and what I ask Allah

1137
01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:54.290
to keep us sincere on this path
and keep us firm.


1138
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:56.890
Where are you
when the women are calling


1139
01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:59.570
in the jails getting raped
by these dirty Kuffars?


1140
01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:02.290
Where are you when we need
to start taking heads off?


1141
01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:06.290
So like I said I asked Allah

1142
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:09.370
to keep us sincere
in the land of jihad.

1143
01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:13.770
But I also invite you all
over to the land of jihad.


1144
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:16.970
<i>Allah akbar!</i>

1145
01:21:31.290 --> 01:21:34.210
We deal with Glocks here.

1146
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:37.290
We also deal in M4s and M16s.

1147
01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:42.290
In 2006 you could get a Glock for $ 1,200.
Today they cost $ 2,400.


1148
01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:47.610
We tell Arabs in ISIS territories

1149
01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:52.210
to buy Glocks and bring them here.

1150
01:21:59.170 --> 01:22:02.090
They're half the price there.

1151
01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:05.250
When the Iraqi army in Mosul was smashed,

1152
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:09.170
people looted the armories.
Any child could grab five or six guns.


1153
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:14.050
In 2006 everyone who joined the police

1154
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:17.170
was issued a Glock.

1155
01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:21.130
Later they'd leave the police,
sell the Glock,


1156
01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:24.090
join the force again
and get another Glock.


1157
01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:30.410
Government didn't do anything
to stop that.


1158
01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:34.570
They were all corrupt.

1159
01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:38.930
You could help us.

1160
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:43.330
<i>Maybe you start doing this. You bring</i>
<i>Glocks from Austria, and we sell it here.</i>


1161
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:46.770
Maybe you start doing this.

1162
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:49.090
You bring Glocks from Austria,
and we sell them here.


1163
01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:51.850
<i>It would be nice to get a permit,</i>
<i>an international permit,</i>


1164
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:55.810
<i>be a weapons supplier</i>
<i>for those conflicted areas.</i>


1165
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.970
<i>So I'll be the master of the war.</i>

1166
01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:04.250
<i>This is a lot of money to supply, like,</i>
<i>the Peshmerga, for instance, </i>


1167
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:07.130
<i>to supply them with weapons.</i>
<i>You make lot of money.</i>


1168
01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:13.330
<i>You know who makes the Glocks.</i>
<i>You could talk to them to get me a permit.</i>


1169
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:30.850
<i>You might not be able to get a permit</i>
<i>from them to be a weapons supplier.</i>


1170
01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:36.690
<i>But maybe you can talk to them get me</i>
<i>a permit and we'll be partners.</i>


1171
01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:40.010
<i>There's a lot of money in there.</i>

1172
01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:43.650
<i>And I'll make sure they won't get</i>
<i>in wrong hands.</i>


1173
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:14.210
<i>Glock began production in the 1980s,</i>
<i>with 1,000 units a month.</i>


1174
01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:19.450
<i>Today 34,000 leave this factory</i>
<i>every week.</i>


1175
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:23.410
<i>That's over 1.5 million guns a year,</i>

1176
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:25.890
<i>supposed to stay out of the wrong hands.</i>

1177
01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:28.970
<i>Demand is on the rise.</i>

1178
01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:35.970
<i>Since 2015, even Austria has witnessed</i>
<i>a surge in private gun ownership.</i>


1179
01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:40.650
<i>Because of this increasing demand,</i> <i>Glock,</i>

1180
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:43.090
<i>as stated in its annual report,</i>

1181
01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:46.250
<i>looks to the future with great optimism.</i>
