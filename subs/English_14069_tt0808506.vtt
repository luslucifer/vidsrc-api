00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:32.064
Here it comes!

2
00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:33.498
Huh?

3
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:37.062
What the...? Hm?

4
00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:41.004
- Makoto, just throw the ball!
- Hmm...


5
00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:44.046
Hey, did you just hear something?

6
00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:45.874
You hear something?

7
00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:47.140
Hear what?

8
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:49.718
What the...?

9
00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:52.751
Hey, Makoto!

10
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.420
Here it comes!

11
00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:02.063
- There!
- W-Whoa... Yeah!


12
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.097
Ah! Damn!

13
00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:07.594
All right!

14
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:09.301
So yesterday...

15
00:01:09.372 --> 00:01:11.340
- Huh?
... pudding...


16
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.343
...I missed out on pudding.

17
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.242
What happened to the pudding?

18
00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:18.281
I bet your little sister beat you
to it again.


19
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:24.484
I was purposely saving it.

20
00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:27.523
How dare she eat it,
that stupid little sister of mine!


21
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.024
Watch it...! There!

22
00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:32.855
Aww, I did it again.

23
00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:34.755
Sis?

24
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:35.695
Huh?

25
00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:37.426
- Sis?
- What?


26
00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:44.537
What the...? Huh?

27
00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:46.542
Makoto! Makoto!

28
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.877
What?

29
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:50.111
Look up! Above you!

30
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.306
Up?

31
00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:56.445
Ow!

32
00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:59.511
Th
-That hurt...

33
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.929
It's about time you got up.

34
00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:21.403
The Girl Who Leapt Through Time

35
00:02:21.978 --> 00:02:24.105
- Do you know what today is?
- Why'd you turn off the alarm?!


36
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.648
You turned it off yourself!
I'm off now!


37
00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:29.742
- It's July 13, which is a "Nice Day".
- You have a good day.


38
00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.514
- What's a "Nice Day"?
- I'm in trouble!


39
00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:34.182
Seven, one, three could be
read as "Na-I-Su".


40
00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:36.225
You're finally up, Makoto?

41
00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:38.523
- G'morning, Dad.
- Oh, uh...


42
00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:45.391
G'morning.

43
00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:48.403
- I'm outta here!
- Oh, Makoto! Hang on!


44
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:49.460
What?

45
00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.133
Take this to your Auntie Witch
after school.


46
00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:56.110
- Tell her it's from Grandma.
- No way! I don't want to take that to school.


47
00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.844
- And...
- Huh?


48
00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:00.815
Maybe you can ask her when
she's going to get married.


49
00:03:00.884 --> 00:03:02.408
- Sure.
- Good.


50
00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:04.248
I'm off!

51
00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:07.546
Have a good day.

52
00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:21.836
Oh, hi, Mako!

53
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:23.404
Good morning!

54
00:03:41.624 --> 00:03:44.787
Sorry about the ruckus
every morning.


55
00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:51.230
- Chiaki!
- Hey, Makoto.


56
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.769
You should work more time
into your schedule.


57
00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:55.532
You're telling me?!

58
00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:57.334
I bet you fell
back asleep after the alarm.

59
00:03:57.407 --> 00:03:58.271
Shut up!

60
00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:00.809
- What's in the basket?
- Nothing!


61
00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:02.435
Come on. Tell me.

62
00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.744
Once again, in the nick of time.

63
00:04:08.818 --> 00:04:11.286
It'd be more refreshing
if you'd just come late.


64
00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:12.685
You're early, Kousuke.

65
00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:14.917
Did you jerk off properly this morning?

66
00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:17.824
Shut up.
You guys are always too late.


67
00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:20.886
- It's not in the nick of time. Look.
- Huh?


68
00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:22.791
Are we lucky or what?

69
00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:24.458
I'm the lucky one.

70
00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:26.434
Huh? What'd you mean?

71
00:04:26.503 --> 00:04:29.666
You tend to say you're out of luck
when you're unlucky.


72
00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:32.003
But I figured that
had nothing to do with me.


73
00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:34.339
If anything, luck tends
to be on my side.

74
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:37.744
Now, why do you think
your teacher was late today?


75
00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:39.042
A mini quiz?

76
00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:40.810
Yes, Hayakawa. Correct!

77
00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:42.651
What?!

78
00:04:47.424 --> 00:04:50.689
Nevertheless, luck still tends
to be on my side.


79
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.751
I also have good instincts too.

80
00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:54.990
Thanks to that, my grades are okay.

81
00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:58.592
I'm not exactly a brain,
but I'm not an idiot either.


82
00:04:58.668 --> 00:05:00.636
You have five minutes left.

83
00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:02.500
Huh?

84
00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:04.540
I'm not an idiot...

85
00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:08.577
You have five minutes left.

86
00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:10.670
This is actually an exception.

87
00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.738
I'm not particularly
adept at things...


88
00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:15.842
...but I'm not so clumsy
that people laugh at me.


89
00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:18.554
Looking back...

90
00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:21.784
...I don't recall having too many
mess ups that I cringe about.


91
00:05:23.193 --> 00:05:24.182
Ow! Hot!

92
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:31.825
What're you doing, idiot?!
Get the fire extinguisher! Hurry!


93
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:33.129
Uh, yeah, right away!

94
00:05:33.203 --> 00:05:35.171
That was also an exception.

95
00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:37.968
- Are you all right?
- I singed my bangs a bit.


96
00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:41.943
Normally I'm pretty careful,
so I've never been badly injured.


97
00:05:42.212 --> 00:05:45.545
And I'm careful not to get involved
in complicated social situations.


98
00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:51.216
H
- Hey!

99
00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:53.346
Aww!

100
00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:56.218
What're you doing?! Come on!

101
00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:11.034
Look, you!

102
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:14.444
- Oh? What's this?
- Blood type horoscopes have nothing to do with this.


103
00:06:14.477 --> 00:06:15.501
- Hold it, you!
- Blood type horoscopes have nothing to do with this.


104
00:06:15.578 --> 00:06:18.547
But it says they're not compatible.
Could be dicey.


105
00:06:18.615 --> 00:06:22.051
Whether it's dicey or not
is up to her to decide.


106
00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:23.142
What?

107
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:30.126
Mathematics II Mini Quiz
"Let's try harder next time!"


108
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:31.093
Makoto.

109
00:06:31.261 --> 00:06:31.989
What?

110
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.130
Liberal Arts/Sciences Are you
going with liberal arts or sciences?


111
00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:36.499
Liberal Arts/Sciences -
Haven't decided. You? - Not yet.


112
00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:37.867
Liberal Arts/Sciences
Thank goodness.


113
00:06:37.901 --> 00:06:40.203
Liberal Arts/Sciences It's not
something to decide quickly.


114
00:06:40.236 --> 00:06:42.238
Liberal Arts/Sciences
You can't tell the future after all.


115
00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:44.607
Liberal Arts/Sciences
It never ends.


116
00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:45.073
Liberal Arts/Sciences

117
00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:46.837
Liberal Arts/Sciences
Hey, Makoto!


118
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.878
How much longer are you gonna be?

119
00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:50.879
Then come and help me!

120
00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:52.414
You've gotta be kidding.

121
00:06:53.483 --> 00:06:54.950
Just hurry it up.

122
00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:55.985
Yeah.

123
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.255
I wonder what Chiaki's
going to choose.


124
00:07:01.324 --> 00:07:03.815
Sciences, I bet.
He's not good with kanji.


125
00:07:03.893 --> 00:07:05.622
And he's amazing in math.

126
00:07:05.695 --> 00:07:08.755
But that's it.
Why bring up Chiaki anyways?


127
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:11.561
Hey, someone's left
the hand-in notebooks here.


128
00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:13.124
Who's in charge of them?

129
00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:15.869
- Who is it?
- It's you!


130
00:07:18.408 --> 00:07:19.773
What a hassle...

131
00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:37.624
There!

132
00:07:39.696 --> 00:07:40.492
Huh?

133
00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:48.697
Time waits for no one.

134
00:07:51.507 --> 00:07:52.474
Hm?

135
00:08:30.747 --> 00:08:31.714
Huh?

136
00:08:37.153 --> 00:08:38.211
What the...?

137
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:39.888
Hm?

138
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.199
It sounded like
someone was here.


139
00:08:55.371 --> 00:08:56.338
Uh...

140
00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:57.899
Huh?!

141
00:08:58.508 --> 00:08:59.566
Hmm...

142
00:09:03.046 --> 00:09:04.536
A locked room...

143
00:09:04.614 --> 00:09:05.410
Huh?

144
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.846
What's that?

145
00:10:51.988 --> 00:10:54.923
Are you an idiot or what?!
You're killing me!


146
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:56.322
You're laughing too much.

147
00:10:56.392 --> 00:10:58.019
Yeah. You're laughing too much.

148
00:10:58.094 --> 00:11:00.824
- But it's just so funny!
- It's not funny.


149
00:11:00.897 --> 00:11:03.024
Wanna get a CT scan
at my dad's clinic?


150
00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:04.999
- I'm fine, all right?
- Be careful.


151
00:11:05.067 --> 00:11:06.796
Something might happen again.

152
00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:09.303
Nothing will happen.
I don't need the hassle.


153
00:11:09.372 --> 00:11:11.738
But people don't just collapse
for no reason.


154
00:11:11.808 --> 00:11:13.105
It's not for no reason!

155
00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:14.336
There was someone there!

156
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.071
- Someone?
- Like who?


157
00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:18.213
Well...

158
00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:21.441
Why would I play a prank on you
and make you fall?


159
00:11:21.517 --> 00:11:22.779
Well...

160
00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:24.513
So I'm the culprit?

161
00:11:26.956 --> 00:11:28.924
Then, who could it have been?

162
00:11:32.495 --> 00:11:34.554
It sure is baking hot.

163
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.723
It's almost summer vacation.
Suck it up!


164
00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:38.460
That's right! Summer vacation!

165
00:11:38.534 --> 00:11:40.434
Let's go somewhere,
the three of us!


166
00:11:40.503 --> 00:11:42.801
- Like where?
- We can go to a night game.


167
00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:45.864
We went last month.
That's all you want to do.


168
00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:47.933
- Then where?
- Like the beach.


169
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.443
Too hot.

170
00:11:49.512 --> 00:11:52.481
Then, how about a fireworks festival?
We can wear yukatas.


171
00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:54.140
I don't have one.

172
00:11:54.217 --> 00:11:56.151
Where do you want to go, Kousuke?

173
00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:58.680
- The library.
- What?!


174
00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:00.051
I'll keep to my studies.

175
00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:03.523
If you keep studying in this heat,
you'll turn into an idiot.


176
00:12:03.593 --> 00:12:05.356
You guys don't study enough.

177
00:12:05.428 --> 00:12:07.658
Yeah, but I'm not
going into medicine.


178
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.288
Then, what are you
going to do?


179
00:12:09.365 --> 00:12:10.332
Huh?

180
00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:13.363
Hmm... I'll become a hotel tycoon.

181
00:12:13.436 --> 00:12:14.232
Uh, what?

182
00:12:14.303 --> 00:12:15.702
Or maybe an oil tycoon.

183
00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:18.069
You've gotta think
about this seriously.


184
00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:23.568
Hey, what are you
going to do, Chiaki?


185
00:12:23.646 --> 00:12:24.613
Me?

186
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:27.043
I'll...

187
00:12:28.284 --> 00:12:29.114
Ow!

188
00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:33.615
You guys need to get serious.

189
00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:36.184
Huh? Going home already?

190
00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:38.921
I forgot my mom wanted me
to do something.


191
00:12:38.995 --> 00:12:41.156
Huh? Don't be such a party pooper.

192
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.255
So, I'm stuck hanging
with this guy alone?


193
00:12:43.332 --> 00:12:44.629
Well, see ya later!

194
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.668
Hey. Hey!

195
00:12:48.404 --> 00:12:51.464
- Let's go!
- But the elves are coming out soon!


196
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:52.974
Good heavens...

197
00:12:54.143 --> 00:12:55.110
Hm?

198
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:57.904
Hey! Watch where you're going!

199
00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.080
I'm sorry!

200
00:12:59.115 --> 00:13:01.015
Kuranose Shopping Arcade

201
00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:06.651
Huh?

202
00:13:08.858 --> 00:13:10.325
If this was just like...

203
00:13:11.594 --> 00:13:14.222
If this was just like any other day...

204
00:13:14.297 --> 00:13:17.095
...there wouldn't have been
any problems.


205
00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:18.463
But...

206
00:13:19.802 --> 00:13:20.598
Huh?!

207
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:23.639
- What?!
- I had forgotten...


208
00:13:23.706 --> 00:13:25.503
...that today was my worst day.

209
00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:26.701
What?!

210
00:13:33.683 --> 00:13:35.275
No!

211
00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:36.677
No!

212
00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:58.863
I can't believe this is happening,
but I'm going to die.


213
00:13:59.609 --> 00:14:01.201
This is my last day.

214
00:14:01.644 --> 00:14:05.205
If I knew this was going to happen,
I would've gotten up earlier.


215
00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:08.409
I wouldn't have slept in,
and I wouldn't have been late.


216
00:14:08.484 --> 00:14:10.816
I would've fried that
tempura better.


217
00:14:10.886 --> 00:14:13.855
And I wouldn't have been
slammed into by some idiot.


218
00:14:14.724 --> 00:14:18.353
I thought today was
supposed to be a "Nice Day".


219
00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:33.206
Ow...

220
00:14:34.176 --> 00:14:36.644
Hey! Where were you looking?!

221
00:14:37.613 --> 00:14:41.174
I want to hear an apology!
Apologize now!


222
00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:44.780
Uh, I'm sorry!

223
00:14:44.854 --> 00:14:47.288
Do you know why you have eyes?

224
00:14:47.356 --> 00:14:50.223
So you can see
where you're going. Got it?!


225
00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:52.283
Y
- Yes, I'm very sorry!

226
00:14:52.528 --> 00:14:54.018
Good heavens...!

227
00:14:55.698 --> 00:14:57.791
Hey, Mom. Look.

228
00:14:57.867 --> 00:14:58.663
Huh?

229
00:14:59.035 --> 00:15:01.026
Oh, my. It's already that time?

230
00:15:01.103 --> 00:15:01.899
Huh?

231
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.711
Hm? How come?

232
00:15:17.286 --> 00:15:18.082
How come?!

233
00:15:38.607 --> 00:15:39.596
Hello?

234
00:15:41.644 --> 00:15:43.077
Miss Yoshiyama?

235
00:15:56.792 --> 00:15:59.659
"White Plum and Two Camellias" This painting is temporarily
unavailable for display due to restoration. Tokyo Metropolitan Museum


236
00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:03.930
Now, take it easy.
She'll be right down.


237
00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:04.988
Makoto!

238
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:06.593
Auntie!

239
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.003
Auntie Witch!

240
00:16:11.874 --> 00:16:14.809
Am I alive?!
I am alive, right?!


241
00:16:15.277 --> 00:16:17.711
There's nothing strange about me, right?

242
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.248
Hmm...

243
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.350
There's something strange
about your bangs.


244
00:16:24.587 --> 00:16:26.555
That was a time leap.

245
00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:27.848
Time leap?!

246
00:16:28.457 --> 00:16:31.290
- You were about to be hit by a train, right?
- Yeah.


247
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.726
- After being thrown off your bike?
- Yeah!


248
00:16:33.796 --> 00:16:37.061
But when you came to,
you had gone back a few minutes?


249
00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:39.761
- That's right!
- That's what you call a time leap.


250
00:16:39.835 --> 00:16:43.202
- You see, time can never be reversed.
- Never be reversed?


251
00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:45.331
- Time itself doesn't go back.
- Hm.


252
00:16:45.407 --> 00:16:48.467
So what went back in time
was you yourself.


253
00:16:48.544 --> 00:16:51.877
It means you leapt back in time
and returned to the past.


254
00:16:53.182 --> 00:16:54.149
Really?

255
00:16:54.517 --> 00:16:56.212
It's not that unusual.

256
00:16:56.285 --> 00:16:59.584
It happens to a lot of girls
around your age.


257
00:17:02.024 --> 00:17:04.390
No way. No way.
That never happens.


258
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.223
It happened to me.

259
00:17:06.295 --> 00:17:07.785
What? Are you serious?

260
00:17:07.863 --> 00:17:10.855
Like, say you sleep in on a Sunday.

261
00:17:11.967 --> 00:17:16.028
And you think, "I really don't
want to do anything today. " Right?


262
00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:18.834
And before you know it,
it's evening.


263
00:17:18.908 --> 00:17:20.535
It's quite a shock.

264
00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.067
You wonder what happened
to your precious Sunday.


265
00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:27.377
I'm talking to you seriously,
so I wish you'd listen seriously.


266
00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:29.144
It's a good thing you're alive.

267
00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:32.411
How about cheering up a bit?

268
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:42.898
Hey...

269
00:17:43.332 --> 00:17:44.299
Yeah?

270
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.264
- Think you can help me?
- All right.


271
00:17:51.473 --> 00:17:53.270
Show me how you did it.

272
00:17:53.342 --> 00:17:54.639
I can't do that!

273
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.679
I'm sure if you get the hang of it,
you could do it again.


274
00:17:57.746 --> 00:17:59.714
I'm telling you it's not possible!

275
00:18:05.788 --> 00:18:09.053
But you did actually
fly through the air, right, Makoto?


276
00:18:19.635 --> 00:18:21.796
- Like this?
- Yes. Tear that part off.


277
00:18:24.974 --> 00:18:27.169
What was that? 
An earthquake?

278
00:18:43.926 --> 00:18:44.893
Huh?

279
00:18:46.095 --> 00:18:47.619
No, Sis!

280
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.425
You mustn't!

281
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:53.866
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

282
00:18:53.936 --> 00:18:55.801
- It's all my fault!
- What?


283
00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:58.840
What's your motive?
Was it because I ate your pudding?


284
00:18:58.908 --> 00:19:00.307
M
- Motive?

285
00:19:00.376 --> 00:19:02.276
I don't want you to die, Sis!

286
00:19:02.344 --> 00:19:03.606
I won't die!

287
00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:06.204
- Where are you going?
- To the convenience store!


288
00:19:06.282 --> 00:19:08.216
If you want pudding,
I'll go get it for you.


289
00:19:08.284 --> 00:19:09.581
Never mind that.

290
00:19:09.652 --> 00:19:11.984
- Are you mad at me?
- I'm not mad at you.


291
00:19:12.054 --> 00:19:15.319
- You sure you're not mad at me?
- I'm not, I'm not.


292
00:19:29.038 --> 00:19:30.005
Here goes!

293
00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:34.971
- There!
- Whoa! That was awesome!


294
00:19:35.044 --> 00:19:38.673
There's no way.
How could you leap back in time?


295
00:19:38.747 --> 00:19:42.046
There's no way you can
jump back in time. No way.


296
00:19:42.117 --> 00:19:45.382
At least it's not something I can do.

297
00:19:54.163 --> 00:20:04.163
Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right!

298
00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:28.027
Go!

299
00:21:05.834 --> 00:21:06.801
Ow! Ow!

300
00:21:07.002 --> 00:21:08.435
Ow...!

301
00:21:10.172 --> 00:21:11.696
Where am I? Where...

302
00:21:16.478 --> 00:21:18.207
Oh, I'm home.

303
00:21:20.182 --> 00:21:20.748
Please eat by July 12

304
00:21:20.783 --> 00:21:21.850
Please eat by July 12
Pudding...


305
00:21:21.885 --> 00:21:23.317
Please eat by July 12

306
00:21:24.153 --> 00:21:26.451
My pudding's here.
Which means...


307
00:21:34.229 --> 00:21:36.629
It's Tuesday, July 12.

308
00:21:36.698 --> 00:21:40.600
Today is the anniversary of when
standard time was adopted in Japan.


309
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:42.034
Back in 1886...

310
00:21:49.845 --> 00:21:51.506
There's that pudding.

311
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.242
- I can eat it?
- Isn't it your sister's?


312
00:21:54.316 --> 00:21:57.513
I'm sure she'll be having
a bite out with Kousuke and them.


313
00:21:57.586 --> 00:21:59.816
I can have it then? Yay!

314
00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:02.523
No way! This is mine!

315
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:03.387
Huh?

316
00:22:03.792 --> 00:22:04.759
Makoto?

317
00:22:06.028 --> 00:22:07.518
You're home?

318
00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:22.036
That hurt...

319
00:22:22.678 --> 00:22:24.646
The pudding!
Where's the pudding?!


320
00:22:27.783 --> 00:22:29.216
It's gone.

321
00:22:29.284 --> 00:22:31.445
- Did you just see that?
- You bet I did.


322
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.217
- Huh? What'd you mean?
- That girl just did an amazing jump.


323
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.188
She did.

324
00:22:36.258 --> 00:22:37.850
And she disappeared
for a second, right?


325
00:22:37.926 --> 00:22:40.292
- What?!
- Why would she disappear?


326
00:22:40.362 --> 00:22:45.197
- Here we go again with your lies.
- It's not a lie. I saw it.


327
00:22:45.434 --> 00:22:48.198
Did I actually just leap?

328
00:23:10.959 --> 00:23:11.983
Delicious!

329
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.027
This is...

330
00:23:13.795 --> 00:23:14.921
This is...

331
00:23:15.464 --> 00:23:16.931
...not a dream.

332
00:23:18.934 --> 00:23:21.903
I can leap.
I can leap through time!


333
00:23:25.574 --> 00:23:26.871
I'm off!

334
00:23:27.643 --> 00:23:28.610
See ya later!

335
00:23:29.211 --> 00:23:30.337
See ya.

336
00:23:36.885 --> 00:23:39.479
- Huh? What time is it?
- Why?


337
00:23:39.555 --> 00:23:44.219
So, as to why today,
July 13, is a "Nice Day"...


338
00:23:56.505 --> 00:23:57.472
G'morning!

339
00:23:58.507 --> 00:24:00.202
- G'morning!
- Huh?


340
00:24:00.576 --> 00:24:02.305
- Good morning!
- Huh?


341
00:24:02.978 --> 00:24:03.808
G'morning.

342
00:24:03.879 --> 00:24:05.369
G'morning!

343
00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:11.815
Huh?

344
00:24:11.987 --> 00:24:13.818
Once again, in the nick of time.

345
00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:16.050
It'd be more refreshing
if you'd just come late.


346
00:24:16.124 --> 00:24:17.455
You're early, Kousuke.

347
00:24:17.526 --> 00:24:20.461
- Did you jerk off properly this morning?
- Stop joking around...


348
00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:22.087
...and try getting up earlier.

349
00:24:22.164 --> 00:24:25.133
What?! Why are you
so early this morning?


350
00:24:27.536 --> 00:24:28.468
Huh?

351
00:24:29.238 --> 00:24:30.705
- Hm?
- Ooh!


352
00:24:30.772 --> 00:24:32.740
I'm all done!

353
00:24:33.342 --> 00:24:34.240
Huh?

354
00:24:39.281 --> 00:24:40.270
Takase...

355
00:24:40.349 --> 00:24:42.544
- Huh?
- Can we switch groups?


356
00:24:42.618 --> 00:24:44.415
Sure, but... Why?

357
00:24:45.954 --> 00:24:47.387
Ow! Ow! Ow!

358
00:24:51.526 --> 00:24:54.051
- It's a fire!
- Don't panic! Shut off the gas!


359
00:24:54.129 --> 00:24:56.427
- Takase, use the fire extinguisher!
- Uh, yeah!


360
00:25:00.702 --> 00:25:03.398
You idiot, Takase!
You're gonna pay!


361
00:25:03.472 --> 00:25:04.461
S
- Sorry!

362
00:25:06.742 --> 00:25:08.539
About Chiaki...

363
00:25:08.844 --> 00:25:11.813
I've got other things
on my mind right now.


364
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.744
Huh?

365
00:25:12.814 --> 00:25:13.610
There!

366
00:25:16.118 --> 00:25:17.085
What the...?

367
00:25:17.653 --> 00:25:19.553
A
- Are you all right?

368
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.118
Makoto, have you decided...

369
00:25:26.194 --> 00:25:28.628
...on whether you're going with
liberal arts or sciences?


370
00:25:28.697 --> 00:25:32.258
- I think I might study abroad.
- What?! What's that all of a sudden?


371
00:25:32.334 --> 00:25:34.529
You know, like an exchange program.

372
00:25:34.603 --> 00:25:37.902
What are you talking about?
You failed Level 3 English.


373
00:25:37.973 --> 00:25:41.238
Oh, come on.
Time waits for no one.


374
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.174
Hey, Makoto!

375
00:25:42.244 --> 00:25:43.609
Coming!

376
00:25:44.846 --> 00:25:46.711
A melon soda and two colas.

377
00:25:46.782 --> 00:25:49.512
Why are we doing karaoke
instead of playing baseball?


378
00:25:49.584 --> 00:25:51.609
We can play baseball after karaoke.

379
00:25:51.687 --> 00:25:55.088
What kind of jam-packed schedule
is this? I don't want any part in this.


380
00:25:55.157 --> 00:25:57.352
Time waits for no one.

381
00:25:57.459 --> 00:26:00.951
Time waits for no one.
Time waits for no one.


382
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:03.554
- Hello?
- Your time is up in five minutes.


383
00:26:03.632 --> 00:26:06.100
- Oh, we'll be leaving then.
- Time?


384
00:26:06.802 --> 00:26:08.770
A melon soda and two colas.

385
00:26:08.837 --> 00:26:12.136
Why are we doing karaoke
instead of playing baseball?


386
00:26:12.207 --> 00:26:13.003
Ow!

387
00:26:15.477 --> 00:26:17.206
What're you doing, Makoto?

388
00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:19.247
Nothing! I mean, I just fell.

389
00:26:19.314 --> 00:26:22.249
How could you fall like that?!
I mean, you were just sitting right here...


390
00:26:22.317 --> 00:26:24.012
Who cares?!
I'm gonna keep singing!


391
00:26:24.086 --> 00:26:25.951
Time waits for no one.

392
00:26:26.021 --> 00:26:27.579
Time waits for no one.
Time waits for no one...


393
00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:30.216
- Hello?
- Your time is up in five minutes.


394
00:26:30.292 --> 00:26:34.353
- Oh, then...
- Oh, then we'll be going home...


395
00:26:34.629 --> 00:26:36.392
Not! Ow!

396
00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:39.929
What're you doing, Makoto?

397
00:26:40.001 --> 00:26:41.195
I just fell.

398
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:44.432
How could you fall like that?!
I mean, you were just sitting right here...


399
00:26:44.506 --> 00:26:47.566
I'm going to keep singing!
I'll do a hundred songs!


400
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:50.109
Uh, excuse me.

401
00:26:50.178 --> 00:26:53.875
We'll have a melon soda,
a cola, and a ginger ale.


402
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.613
I'm home...

403
00:26:56.818 --> 00:26:59.787
- What's with that voice?
- Singing karaoke.


404
00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:02.380
How long were you singing
for it to get like that?


405
00:27:02.457 --> 00:27:03.856
About ten hours.

406
00:27:03.925 --> 00:27:05.586
Don't be silly.

407
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.059
I'm exhausted.

408
00:27:07.129 --> 00:27:09.620
- What's for dinner?
- Chicken and veggie stew.


409
00:27:09.698 --> 00:27:10.630
What?!

410
00:27:10.699 --> 00:27:13.395
Why don't we do teppanyaki
or something?


411
00:27:13.468 --> 00:27:14.992
We had that two days ago.

412
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:18.233
- Aww, I want teppanyaki...
- You're complaining a lot.


413
00:27:18.306 --> 00:27:21.275
You could've come home
earlier and helped out.


414
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.806
Ha!

415
00:27:23.712 --> 00:27:26.374
- W-What's the matter?
- Huh? Uh, nothing.


416
00:27:26.448 --> 00:27:27.676
Wow!

417
00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:31.280
This is it!
Thank you so much!


418
00:27:37.359 --> 00:27:38.155
There!

419
00:27:39.161 --> 00:27:39.957
Yes!

420
00:27:40.362 --> 00:27:42.330
Why are you only catching mine?!

421
00:27:42.397 --> 00:27:45.230
- Damn! Damn!
- I'm amazed she can catch like that.


422
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.858
Wham! There! Yeah!

423
00:27:46.935 --> 00:27:48.027
Not again!

424
00:27:48.103 --> 00:27:50.162
How are you able to read my pitches?!

425
00:27:50.238 --> 00:27:52.263
There's nothing
you can hide from me!


426
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.308
There's nothing I can't see through!

427
00:27:54.376 --> 00:27:56.776
I'll beat anyone, every time!

428
00:27:57.479 --> 00:27:59.106
What's she yelling about?

429
00:28:18.667 --> 00:28:21.295
Pastries from A Tes Souhaits.
You've gone all out.


430
00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:22.358
Don't worry about it.

431
00:28:22.437 --> 00:28:24.871
It's my way of saying
thanks for all the advice.


432
00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.909
Even if I spend
all my allowance money...


433
00:28:27.976 --> 00:28:30.706
...all I have to do is go
back to my allowance day!


434
00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:33.043
Then I get all the money back!

435
00:28:33.415 --> 00:28:35.383
I can leap around any way I want!

436
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.475
I can sleep in and keep
hitting the snooze button.


437
00:28:37.552 --> 00:28:39.543
I never have to go back
for things I forgot.


438
00:28:39.621 --> 00:28:42.089
And all-you-can-eat deals
don't end in 90 minutes anymore!


439
00:28:42.157 --> 00:28:45.092
Oh, and if you forget to tape
a show or something...


440
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.718
...just ask me and I'll do it.

441
00:28:46.795 --> 00:28:48.695
- Thank goodness.
- Why?


442
00:28:48.763 --> 00:28:51.095
It doesn't seem like you're using
your skill for anything big.


443
00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:54.966
What are you talking about?!
I mean, this time leaping is the best!


444
00:28:55.036 --> 00:28:56.970
I can't get enough of it!

445
00:28:57.038 --> 00:29:00.735
Everyday is just so much fun!
I just can't stop laughing!


446
00:29:05.347 --> 00:29:07.315
Maybe there's someone out there...

447
00:29:07.382 --> 00:29:09.907
...who's having a rough time
because of your good times?


448
00:29:09.985 --> 00:29:10.849
What?

449
00:29:12.554 --> 00:29:14.021
You think there is?

450
00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:15.056
Who knows?

451
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.127
This is good.

452
00:29:21.329 --> 00:29:24.355
There can't be!
And besides, everything'll be alright.


453
00:29:24.432 --> 00:29:26.059
I mean, I can always go back.

454
00:29:26.134 --> 00:29:29.103
I can reset things
as many times as I want.


455
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.278
Look at this! This is perfect!

456
00:29:37.345 --> 00:29:39.313
You'll have to wait a year
if you miss this chance.


457
00:29:39.381 --> 00:29:41.406
You were going to
tell him today, right?


458
00:29:41.483 --> 00:29:43.713
- Yeah.
- You've got to give it a good crack.


459
00:29:43.785 --> 00:29:45.377
Crack it and then what?

460
00:29:45.453 --> 00:29:46.943
Sempai!

461
00:29:48.156 --> 00:29:49.282
- Me?
- No!


462
00:29:50.091 --> 00:29:52.423
Um...
Well...


463
00:29:52.827 --> 00:29:53.794
Kaho!

464
00:29:54.229 --> 00:29:55.025
Yeah.

465
00:29:55.564 --> 00:29:57.031
We'll go ahead!

466
00:29:57.866 --> 00:29:58.833
All right!

467
00:29:59.568 --> 00:30:02.765
- What's with those girls?
- Let's just get going.


468
00:30:05.106 --> 00:30:09.008
Enough with that girly throw.
Put your shoulder into it.


469
00:30:15.016 --> 00:30:15.812
Hey.

470
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:17.584
You're late!

471
00:30:17.652 --> 00:30:18.812
Sorry.

472
00:30:18.887 --> 00:30:20.377
So, uh...

473
00:30:20.455 --> 00:30:21.422
Those girls?

474
00:30:21.756 --> 00:30:24.054
Just juniors from the Volunteer Club.

475
00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:26.320
Right. What'd they want?

476
00:30:26.394 --> 00:30:30.057
They wanted to know
if I was going out with you.


477
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:32.292
What?! We're not going out, right?

478
00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:35.530
- That's what I told them.
- And? Anything else?


479
00:30:35.604 --> 00:30:37.572
I don't know why, but...

480
00:30:38.873 --> 00:30:39.840
...she asked me out.

481
00:30:39.908 --> 00:30:42.433
- Way to go!
- Are you serious?


482
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.671
- So, what'd you say?
- Said I can't go out with her.


483
00:30:44.746 --> 00:30:46.646
What?! You're so mean!

484
00:30:46.715 --> 00:30:47.807
Take it easy.

485
00:30:47.882 --> 00:30:50.851
- It took guts to ask you out!
- Why'd you say no?!


486
00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:52.682
I'd definitely go out with her!

487
00:30:52.754 --> 00:30:53.846
I mean, come on...

488
00:30:53.922 --> 00:30:57.358
But she looks like that girl
you liked in junior high.


489
00:30:57.459 --> 00:30:59.051
No, she doesn't!

490
00:31:01.596 --> 00:31:03.894
Don't come crying
if you change your mind...


491
00:31:03.965 --> 00:31:05.227
...and it's too late.

492
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.097
You can drop the subject now.

493
00:31:07.335 --> 00:31:08.302
See ya.

494
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:09.594
Yeah.

495
00:31:20.115 --> 00:31:21.912
Hey, where's your bike?

496
00:31:21.983 --> 00:31:24.042
- Something happened to it.
- Get on the back then.


497
00:31:24.119 --> 00:31:26.917
You're going to take me home?
Lucky me!


498
00:31:33.895 --> 00:31:36.193
You really think he wasn't interested?

499
00:31:36.264 --> 00:31:38.960
If Kousuke says he's not,
then he's not.


500
00:31:39.601 --> 00:31:41.865
- I'm a bit relieved.
- Why?


501
00:31:41.936 --> 00:31:44.530
If he gets a girlfriend,
he'd treat her good, right?


502
00:31:44.606 --> 00:31:46.039
He's that kind of guy.

503
00:31:46.107 --> 00:31:48.473
Then we won't be able to
play baseball anymore.


504
00:31:48.543 --> 00:31:52.001
I guess tossing the ball around
wouldn't count as baseball.


505
00:31:54.382 --> 00:31:55.974
I don't know.

506
00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:59.418
I thought maybe the three of us
would always be together.


507
00:32:00.555 --> 00:32:03.319
Kousuke would tell us
off for being late...


508
00:32:03.558 --> 00:32:06.925
...and you would tease me for not
being able to catch the ball...


509
00:32:16.204 --> 00:32:17.171
Makoto...

510
00:32:17.238 --> 00:32:18.136
Hm?

511
00:32:18.206 --> 00:32:21.573
How about you go out with me?

512
00:32:30.919 --> 00:32:32.181
Stop the bike.

513
00:32:33.254 --> 00:32:34.721
Stop for a second.

514
00:32:40.862 --> 00:32:42.329
- What was that?
- Huh?


515
00:32:42.397 --> 00:32:44.957
- What you just said.
- You want to go out?


516
00:32:45.033 --> 00:32:47.433
How did we get to talking about that?

517
00:32:47.502 --> 00:32:50.903
You were talking about
what if Kousuke got a girlfriend.


518
00:32:50.972 --> 00:32:53.873
I'm not that ugly, am I?

519
00:32:54.843 --> 00:32:55.810
Serious?

520
00:32:55.877 --> 00:32:56.844
Serious.

521
00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.458
W
- W
-Wait a minute!

522
00:33:13.895 --> 00:33:15.920
What is it now?

523
00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:17.898
Huh?

524
00:33:20.835 --> 00:33:21.802
Makoto?

525
00:33:26.241 --> 00:33:27.037
Ow!

526
00:33:29.811 --> 00:33:30.869
Huh?

527
00:33:30.945 --> 00:33:32.913
What the hell are you doing?!

528
00:33:33.381 --> 00:33:34.075
Nothing.

529
00:33:34.749 --> 00:33:36.979
Don't come crying
if you change your mind...


530
00:33:37.051 --> 00:33:38.075
...and it's too late.

531
00:33:38.153 --> 00:33:40.314
You can drop the subject now.

532
00:33:40.388 --> 00:33:41.355
See ya.

533
00:33:41.422 --> 00:33:42.389
Yeah.

534
00:33:46.227 --> 00:33:48.195
Hey, where's your bike?

535
00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:49.920
Get on the back.

536
00:33:52.901 --> 00:33:55.699
How dare Kousuke beat me to it.

537
00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.967
It's not like he's found
himself a girlfriend.


538
00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.473
That's what he says now...

539
00:34:00.542 --> 00:34:03.306
...but I bet if he got one,
he'd pick her over us.


540
00:34:03.378 --> 00:34:05.312
- You can't be sure.
- Damn.


541
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.543
Without Kousuke,
we'd only be able to toss the ball.


542
00:34:08.616 --> 00:34:10.413
You can think about that...

543
00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:12.680
...when he gets a girlfriend.

544
00:34:12.754 --> 00:34:15.222
Well, I guess if he gets one,
then that's that.


545
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.518
So then Makoto...

546
00:34:16.591 --> 00:34:21.358
...how about you go out with me?
- Like I said, why are we talking about this?!


547
00:34:23.464 --> 00:34:25.227
That's what he says now...

548
00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.996
...but I bet if he got one,
he'd pick her over us.


549
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:30.970
H- Hey, you know what?
My sister's a total idiot!


550
00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:33.837
Huh? I was just talking about Kousuke.

551
00:34:33.908 --> 00:34:35.967
Let's talk about my sister.

552
00:34:36.044 --> 00:34:38.069
If Kousuke finds himself a girlfriend...

553
00:34:38.146 --> 00:34:39.807
You know, my sister...!

554
00:34:39.881 --> 00:34:41.815
You want to go out with me?!

555
00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:46.944
Don't come crying
if you change your mind...


556
00:34:47.021 --> 00:34:48.352
...and it's too late.

557
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.858
You can drop the subject now.

558
00:34:51.693 --> 00:34:53.320
Huh? Makoto?

559
00:34:53.394 --> 00:34:55.259
- Get on the back.
- No thanks.


560
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.128
Hey, what's the matter
all of a sudden?


561
00:35:00.168 --> 00:35:01.692
What's up with her?

562
00:35:01.769 --> 00:35:04.260
- It's your fault!
- How so?!


563
00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.841
I always thought you liked Chiaki.

564
00:35:11.913 --> 00:35:15.110
Didn't you say you had to
stick by him...


565
00:35:15.183 --> 00:35:19.085
...so he'd stay out of trouble?
- I might've said that before.


566
00:35:19.153 --> 00:35:22.418
Why pretend he never asked?
Just go out with him.


567
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.515
- No way! No way! No way!
- Why not?


568
00:35:24.592 --> 00:35:28.756
I can't imagine Chiaki
being more than just a friend.


569
00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:29.626
If it doesn't work out...

570
00:35:29.697 --> 00:35:31.665
...just go back in time.

571
00:35:31.733 --> 00:35:35.032
- I'm sure you can do that.
- I don't need to go through with that.


572
00:35:35.103 --> 00:35:37.970
Sometimes you can fall in love with
someone who says they love you.


573
00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:39.734
It won't happen! Never!

574
00:35:39.807 --> 00:35:40.774
I see.

575
00:35:41.142 --> 00:35:43.838
So you're pretending
it never happened.


576
00:35:43.912 --> 00:35:45.379
Poor Chiaki.

577
00:35:45.446 --> 00:35:48.904
And after he got the courage
to tell you how he felt.


578
00:35:50.585 --> 00:35:54.180
But I suppose he doesn't
even realize that he did.


579
00:35:59.227 --> 00:36:02.560
Chiaki came to our school
this spring, right?


580
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:03.426
Yeah.

581
00:36:03.498 --> 00:36:05.932
I heard he's been
transferring schools a lot.


582
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.864
Apparently.

583
00:36:06.935 --> 00:36:09.665
Are the rumors true
about him returning from abroad?


584
00:36:09.737 --> 00:36:13.138
I doubt it.
He's not too bright, for one.


585
00:36:13.207 --> 00:36:14.504
- Not true, huh?
- Not true.


586
00:36:14.575 --> 00:36:17.476
I wonder if something happened
to him at his last school?


587
00:36:17.545 --> 00:36:20.480
- Why don't you ask him?
- 'Cuz, I don't have his email.


588
00:36:20.548 --> 00:36:22.106
You're in the same class.

589
00:36:22.183 --> 00:36:24.413
But you're really good friends with him.

590
00:36:24.485 --> 00:36:26.453
But I wouldn't ask him
something like that.


591
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:29.081
- And I wouldn't say we're good friends.
- That's a lie.


592
00:36:29.157 --> 00:36:32.217
It's not a lie. I mean...

593
00:36:39.167 --> 00:36:40.429
Stop it!

594
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:43.095
- I can't stop it!
- It's all your fault!


595
00:36:43.171 --> 00:36:46.766
- They're getting back at him!
- Stop it, you guys!


596
00:36:46.841 --> 00:36:48.809
Look, he's turning his ass towards us!

597
00:36:51.179 --> 00:36:52.646
- Who shut it off?
- Huh?


598
00:36:52.714 --> 00:36:53.806
Huh?

599
00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:55.582
It's Mamiya.

600
00:36:56.651 --> 00:36:58.619
Are you about done?

601
00:37:01.356 --> 00:37:03.586
- Next time, Takase.
- See ya.


602
00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:07.992
That's pretty bad.
You're totally soaked.


603
00:37:08.296 --> 00:37:10.161
Are you all right, Takase?

604
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:12.222
They threw cola on me yesterday.

605
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.768
But I did manage
to throw a latte back.

606
00:37:14.836 --> 00:37:17.999
They came after you
because of that. Right?


607
00:37:18.072 --> 00:37:19.471
Hey, Makoto!

608
00:37:20.975 --> 00:37:25.571
Did you watch the night game last night?
That Saito sure put the squeeze on.


609
00:37:25.646 --> 00:37:26.613
Hm?

610
00:37:27.515 --> 00:37:30.746
- Did you just look away?
- No, I didn't.


611
00:37:30.818 --> 00:37:32.308
What are you up to?

612
00:37:32.387 --> 00:37:33.354
Nothing.

613
00:37:33.454 --> 00:37:37.049
What's going on? Tell me.
What's up your sleeve?


614
00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:38.592
I said, nothing!

615
00:37:39.293 --> 00:37:40.260
Huh?

616
00:37:42.363 --> 00:37:43.887
What's the matter?

617
00:37:46.868 --> 00:37:48.631
Konno, you...!

618
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.767
Why'd you ask me to fry the tempura?

619
00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.536
Uh, well, I didn't think
that would happen!


620
00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.202
This is all your fault, idiot!

621
00:37:57.278 --> 00:38:01.009
What?! Who're you calling an idiot?!
Keep it up and I'll throw this!


622
00:38:01.082 --> 00:38:01.912
Hey. Come on!

623
00:38:01.983 --> 00:38:03.075
Fine! Throw it!

624
00:38:06.521 --> 00:38:08.352
Sorry. Didn't mean to.

625
00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:10.479
You idiot!

626
00:38:11.626 --> 00:38:15.221
That guy's pretty rude.
He's calling everyone an idiot.


627
00:38:15.296 --> 00:38:17.423
You're always calling me an idiot.

628
00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:20.167
Yeah, but I say it out of love.

629
00:38:24.572 --> 00:38:27.541
Where's your come back?
You're leaving me hanging.


630
00:38:27.608 --> 00:38:30.771
Isn't she a little off today?
Don't you think so, Hayakawa?


631
00:38:30.845 --> 00:38:32.972
Oh, uh... yes, indeed.

632
00:38:33.047 --> 00:38:37.177
- What's with the polite talk?
- Well, we haven't spoken much before.


633
00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:18.922
Makoto!

634
00:39:23.131 --> 00:39:24.393
She's not here.

635
00:39:24.465 --> 00:39:25.989
Why isn't she here?

636
00:39:26.067 --> 00:39:28.331
- Did something happen?
- Huh?


637
00:39:28.402 --> 00:39:29.426
No! Nothing!

638
00:39:29.504 --> 00:39:32.405
I bet you said something that
pissed her off.


639
00:39:32.473 --> 00:39:34.168
Don't say she's got big feet.

640
00:39:34.242 --> 00:39:37.700
- She's self-conscious about that.
- I said, there was nothing!


641
00:39:38.446 --> 00:39:39.413
Nothing!

642
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.542
At least I don't think so...

643
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.418
Whoa...!

644
00:39:49.657 --> 00:39:50.851
Toss it back!

645
00:39:54.362 --> 00:39:56.626
I can't throw while I'm thinking.

646
00:40:00.668 --> 00:40:03.102
I don't know... 
I just don't get it.

647
00:40:22.757 --> 00:40:23.856
Oh, it's just Yuri.

648
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:24.725
Mailbox: Something great happened today!
What should I do?! Oh, it's just Yuri.


649
00:40:24.759 --> 00:40:27.762
Mailbox: Something great happened today! What
should I do?! "Something great happened today!"


650
00:40:27.797 --> 00:40:28.319
"Something great happened today!"

651
00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:29.385
Something great?

652
00:40:29.764 --> 00:40:32.733
Mail Reply - Text:
Well?! What?! Tell me!


653
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.461
Mail Reply 
- Mail sent.

654
00:40:41.809 --> 00:40:45.677
Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah. Hang on.

655
00:40:46.047 --> 00:40:47.742
Yeah... Yeah...

656
00:40:57.225 --> 00:40:59.193
I wonder what it was?

657
00:41:02.396 --> 00:41:05.490
Hurry, let's go!
They're going to sell out!


658
00:41:05.566 --> 00:41:08.763
Umm, I'm not feeling
very good today.


659
00:41:08.836 --> 00:41:10.269
What?! You want to go
to the nurse's office?


660
00:41:10.338 --> 00:41:12.738
Oh! Uh, I'm fine. I'll be okay.

661
00:41:35.963 --> 00:41:40.832
- Let's hurry! This is something to see!
- What is it?


662
00:41:41.202 --> 00:41:43.670
- This way, this way!
- What's going on?


663
00:41:54.682 --> 00:41:56.309
Stop it, Takase!

664
00:41:57.918 --> 00:42:00.648
You're the ones that didn't stop
when I asked you to!


665
00:42:00.988 --> 00:42:03.149
All right! We were wrong!

666
00:42:03.224 --> 00:42:05.419
Then why'd you do it
in the first place?


667
00:42:05.493 --> 00:42:07.358
- That guy's lost it.
- Did someone call a teacher?


668
00:42:07.428 --> 00:42:08.895
Hey, check this out!

669
00:42:09.897 --> 00:42:11.387
Stop that, Takase!

670
00:42:11.666 --> 00:42:12.860
Takase!

671
00:42:16.404 --> 00:42:18.201
Konno!

672
00:42:18.606 --> 00:42:21.404
Did you just order me?!

673
00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:23.467
N
- No, I didn't!

674
00:42:23.644 --> 00:42:25.202
You did, too!

675
00:42:29.684 --> 00:42:31.208
Huh?! What?!

676
00:42:31.919 --> 00:42:36.583
W
- Why?! Damn! Damn! D
-Damn!

677
00:42:37.992 --> 00:42:40.358
- Hey! Stop it!
- Enough!


678
00:42:40.428 --> 00:42:42.692
- Takase!
- S-Stop...


679
00:42:42.763 --> 00:42:43.730
Watch out!

680
00:42:44.832 --> 00:42:45.799
Takase!

681
00:42:58.446 --> 00:42:59.538
Chiaki!

682
00:43:01.515 --> 00:43:02.482
Chiaki!

683
00:43:17.231 --> 00:43:18.698
- Are you okay?
- Yuri!


684
00:43:18.766 --> 00:43:20.859
- I heard that hit her big time!
- What year is she?


685
00:43:20.935 --> 00:43:22.527
Hurry, call a teacher!

686
00:43:22.603 --> 00:43:25.731
I- It wasn't my fault!
It wasn't my fault...!


687
00:43:26.073 --> 00:43:29.167
- Yuri! Yuri!
- Are you okay? Yuri!


688
00:43:41.122 --> 00:43:44.023
Don't cry. It's not that bad.

689
00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:46.483
What if it leaves a scar?

690
00:43:47.828 --> 00:43:50.797
If that happens,
I'll deal with it somehow.


691
00:43:51.565 --> 00:43:53.260
Deal with it somehow?

692
00:43:53.334 --> 00:43:54.858
I'll deal with it somehow.

693
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:10.210
No boys allowed.

694
00:44:10.284 --> 00:44:11.683
Does it hurt?

695
00:44:11.986 --> 00:44:13.078
Yeah.

696
00:44:13.154 --> 00:44:15.145
- Let's see.
- No.


697
00:44:15.222 --> 00:44:16.189
Come on.

698
00:44:18.058 --> 00:44:19.025
Thanks.

699
00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:28.928
I'm sorry, seriously!

700
00:44:29.003 --> 00:44:30.834
Huh?! But, why?!

701
00:44:30.905 --> 00:44:32.736
I said I'm really sorry.

702
00:44:33.374 --> 00:44:37.140
Man, who takes a girl to a night game
on their first date?


703
00:44:37.578 --> 00:44:39.944
I thought the three of us were going!

704
00:44:40.014 --> 00:44:41.811
I was looking forward to it!

705
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.748
Look, I feel bad about it, all right?

706
00:44:44.819 --> 00:44:47.287
Hayakawa said a night game
would be fine.


707
00:44:47.354 --> 00:44:49.413
So, are you gonna go out with her?

708
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:50.957
- Of course.
- What?!


709
00:44:51.025 --> 00:44:51.992
Ow!

710
00:44:52.993 --> 00:44:54.426
You all right, Makoto?

711
00:44:54.495 --> 00:44:57.123
- Are you serious?
- You're saying I can't?


712
00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:03.995
Well, what can I say? Yuri gets
my tastes. You know what I mean?


713
00:45:04.805 --> 00:45:06.272
Well, good for you!

714
00:45:06.941 --> 00:45:10.274
Hey! Idiot!
Where are you throwing the ball?!


715
00:45:15.483 --> 00:45:16.745
I'm home!

716
00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:22.222
- Huh? Where's the rice?
- I'm making some more.


717
00:45:22.289 --> 00:45:24.621
- Why?
- Sis ate it all.


718
00:45:25.526 --> 00:45:26.322
Aww!

719
00:45:26.961 --> 00:45:31.125
What's with that guy?
After telling me he liked me!


720
00:45:47.481 --> 00:45:49.472
I almost drowned!

721
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.612
Huh? Huh? Hm?

722
00:45:55.256 --> 00:45:56.484
What is this?

723
00:45:59.927 --> 00:46:01.292
Ninety?

724
00:46:17.912 --> 00:46:19.243
Makoto!

725
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.048
Ow! Let go!

726
00:46:22.583 --> 00:46:24.380
I think we lost this one.

727
00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:26.646
She's pulled one over on us,
that's for sure.


728
00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.688
The world is full of deceit.

729
00:46:33.761 --> 00:46:36.628
I guess with just the two of us,
we can only toss the ball.


730
00:46:36.697 --> 00:46:38.597
Let's drag Chiaki with us tomorrow.

731
00:46:38.666 --> 00:46:40.327
That's not fair to Yuri.

732
00:46:40.401 --> 00:46:44.167
If I tell him that you're feeling lonely,
I bet he'd come.


733
00:46:45.005 --> 00:46:46.734
But I'm not lonely.

734
00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:51.269
Didn't Chiaki go with Hayakawa
because you turned him down?


735
00:46:51.345 --> 00:46:52.903
I didn't turn him down!

736
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.969
Really?

737
00:46:54.048 --> 00:46:55.913
What's that supposed to mean?!

738
00:46:57.284 --> 00:46:58.478
Oh, boy...

739
00:46:58.719 --> 00:47:02.177
What about you?
Why don't you get a girlfriend?


740
00:47:02.523 --> 00:47:04.423
If I got a girlfriend...

741
00:47:04.725 --> 00:47:06.693
...then you'd end up alone.

742
00:47:12.299 --> 00:47:15.132
I thought you fancied Kousuke.

743
00:47:15.603 --> 00:47:19.505
Isn't it always Kousuke that helps you
when you're having problems?


744
00:47:19.573 --> 00:47:21.871
Kousuke's always there for anyone.

745
00:47:22.042 --> 00:47:24.010
Why don't you go out with him?

746
00:47:24.078 --> 00:47:26.569
- Why would you suggest that?
- Like I said before...


747
00:47:26.647 --> 00:47:29.844
...if it doesn't work out,
you can always go back to what it was.


748
00:47:29.917 --> 00:47:31.646
I would never do that.

749
00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:32.481
Why not?

750
00:47:32.553 --> 00:47:34.646
Toying with people's feelings...

751
00:47:34.722 --> 00:47:36.485
Can't do such a terrible thing?

752
00:47:36.557 --> 00:47:37.353
Huh?

753
00:47:37.424 --> 00:47:40.552
Since you've been able to
go back into the past...


754
00:47:40.628 --> 00:47:43.222
...you haven't held back with your games.

755
00:47:43.297 --> 00:47:45.925
What? Is that how you see it?

756
00:47:46.233 --> 00:47:47.598
I suppose.

757
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:51.260
She's a witch.

758
00:47:52.239 --> 00:47:54.503
Yup, she's definitely "Auntie Witch".

759
00:47:58.045 --> 00:47:59.945
Hey, this painting...

760
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.442
Recognize it?

761
00:48:01.515 --> 00:48:04.541
Yeah. It's the one
you've been restoring.


762
00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:10.821
It's a strange painting.

763
00:48:10.891 --> 00:48:14.691
The longer you look at it, the more
relaxed and comforted you feel.


764
00:48:15.896 --> 00:48:16.863
Yeah.

765
00:48:18.098 --> 00:48:20.066
We don't know who the painter is...

766
00:48:20.134 --> 00:48:23.661
...and we still don't really know
whether it has any artistic merit.


767
00:48:23.737 --> 00:48:27.696
But there's one thing I did learn
while working on its restoration.


768
00:48:28.575 --> 00:48:30.566
This work was painted...

769
00:48:30.644 --> 00:48:34.205
...during a historical period of
famine and war many centuries ago.


770
00:48:34.915 --> 00:48:35.939
What?

771
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:39.780
I wonder how someone was able
to paint such a thing...


772
00:48:39.853 --> 00:48:43.152
...while it seemed
the world was ending.


773
00:49:21.962 --> 00:49:24.021
What're you going to do, Konno?

774
00:49:24.098 --> 00:49:27.534
You're the only one that hasn't
submitted a chosen academic track.


775
00:49:28.302 --> 00:49:29.291
Konno...

776
00:49:29.636 --> 00:49:30.625
Hm?

777
00:49:30.704 --> 00:49:32.001
Konno...

778
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.537
- Konno!
- Yes!


779
00:49:34.641 --> 00:49:36.472
Don't get cocky because
you did well on the...


780
00:49:36.543 --> 00:49:38.511
...practice college entrance exam.

781
00:49:38.579 --> 00:49:39.375
Yes, sir!

782
00:49:46.286 --> 00:49:47.878
That's weird...

783
00:49:49.423 --> 00:49:52.221
I swear it said "90" last time.

784
00:49:55.362 --> 00:49:57.421
I know. Why not ask her ourselves?

785
00:49:57.498 --> 00:49:58.590
Oh, but...

786
00:49:58.665 --> 00:50:01.156
- What?
- W-Wait!


787
00:50:01.235 --> 00:50:03.328
W
- Whoa! What's this about?!

788
00:50:03.403 --> 00:50:06.531
Miss Konno! We are members
of the Volunteer Club!


789
00:50:06.607 --> 00:50:08.871
And there's something
we'd like to ask you directly!


790
00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:10.341
I
- It's nothing!

791
00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.344
- We've noticed lately that...
- H-Hang on...


792
00:50:12.412 --> 00:50:13.845
- You're always with Kousuke!
- W-Wait!


793
00:50:13.914 --> 00:50:15.381
- I guess...
- Stop this!


794
00:50:15.449 --> 00:50:18.111
Does this mean that
you're going out with him?!


795
00:50:18.185 --> 00:50:19.550
Are you going out with him?

796
00:50:19.653 --> 00:50:21.587
Are you going out with him?!

797
00:50:27.294 --> 00:50:30.627
I was still in junior high
at the time...


798
00:50:30.697 --> 00:50:34.292
...but apparently, the Volunteer
Club of Kuranose Senior High...


799
00:50:34.368 --> 00:50:37.565
...once visited the old age home
that my grandmother was at.


800
00:50:37.638 --> 00:50:41.074
My grandmother was particularly
impressed with one of the...


801
00:50:41.141 --> 00:50:44.804
...students and she had
spoken to me about him many times.


802
00:50:44.878 --> 00:50:48.939
She would go on about what a kind
and gentle boy he was.


803
00:50:49.016 --> 00:50:51.610
She said it over and over.

804
00:50:52.219 --> 00:50:55.188
Since she had talked so
much about him...


805
00:50:55.255 --> 00:50:58.019
...I kind of began
to fall in love with him...


806
00:50:58.125 --> 00:51:02.789
...even though I'd never even met him.
- That's a cute story.


807
00:51:02.863 --> 00:51:05.229
I found out when
I got into senior high...


808
00:51:05.299 --> 00:51:08.700
...that the student was
Kousuke Tsuda.


809
00:51:08.769 --> 00:51:11.203
Wow, things like that really happen.

810
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:14.297
But as you can see,
this girl is a total shrinking violet.


811
00:51:14.374 --> 00:51:16.569
We worked so hard
to pump her up.


812
00:51:16.643 --> 00:51:20.306
And we finally got her
to declare her feelings to him.


813
00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.472
Oh, the other day...

814
00:51:21.548 --> 00:51:23.482
But according to Kousuke...

815
00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:24.517
Huh? Hm?

816
00:51:25.552 --> 00:51:28.612
"I already have a girl that
I've given my heart to!"


817
00:51:28.689 --> 00:51:31.089
"So I'm sorry. 
I can't go out with you!"

818
00:51:31.158 --> 00:51:32.318
Um, but... wait...

819
00:51:32.392 --> 00:51:33.984
- But that's not how it went.
- Huh?


820
00:51:34.494 --> 00:51:37.986
"How could an idiot like that get
a higher mark than me?"


821
00:51:38.065 --> 00:51:40.499
"I can't be slacking off anymore, so... "

822
00:51:40.968 --> 00:51:42.833
And so he apologized.

823
00:51:47.174 --> 00:51:50.200
Could that "idiot"
he's referring to, be me?


824
00:51:50.277 --> 00:51:52.245
- And that's when Kousuke...
- Huh?!


825
00:51:52.312 --> 00:51:54.940
...said he wasn't going out
with you!


826
00:51:55.015 --> 00:51:57.074
But what has been
going on lately?!


827
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.118
Something just doesn't seem right!

828
00:51:59.186 --> 00:52:00.847
Please explain properly!

829
00:52:00.921 --> 00:52:02.650
H
- Hang on a minute!

830
00:52:02.723 --> 00:52:04.691
O
- Okay! All right!

831
00:52:05.692 --> 00:52:08.525
Ahem! I'll deal with this somehow.

832
00:52:08.862 --> 00:52:09.794
Somehow?

833
00:52:09.963 --> 00:52:11.863
What do you mean, somehow?

834
00:52:12.199 --> 00:52:13.826
I'll deal with it somehow!

835
00:52:25.579 --> 00:52:26.375
Ow!

836
00:52:27.781 --> 00:52:30.579
- What the...?!
- What happened?


837
00:52:33.654 --> 00:52:35.485
Um... Well...

838
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.357
Kaho!

839
00:52:37.958 --> 00:52:38.925
Yeah.

840
00:52:39.326 --> 00:52:40.293
Um...

841
00:52:41.395 --> 00:52:42.384
Kousuke!

842
00:52:43.797 --> 00:52:44.764
Huh?

843
00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:50.599
What? Didn't you just head off
to the baseball field?!


844
00:52:50.671 --> 00:52:51.865
Never mind that!

845
00:52:51.939 --> 00:52:55.500
This girl's grandmother says she's
so grateful that you came around...


846
00:52:55.575 --> 00:52:57.770
...and took care of her at
the old age home.


847
00:52:57.844 --> 00:52:59.607
I'm impressed, Kousuke!
And, you see...


848
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.241
H
- How do you know my grandmother?!

849
00:53:03.317 --> 00:53:06.445
How? Um, I met
her at the bowling alley...


850
00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.078
My grandmother's bedridden!

851
00:53:08.155 --> 00:53:09.622
Oh! That's not it...!

852
00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:11.555
Let me know when you're
done talking.


853
00:53:11.625 --> 00:53:13.820
Uh, w-wait, Kousuke!

854
00:53:16.897 --> 00:53:18.091
What the...?!

855
00:53:20.734 --> 00:53:21.792
One more time!

856
00:53:28.241 --> 00:53:29.037
Ow!

857
00:53:30.477 --> 00:53:31.774
Um... Well...

858
00:53:33.146 --> 00:53:34.113
Kousuke!

859
00:53:35.382 --> 00:53:36.246
Huh?

860
00:53:37.284 --> 00:53:38.251
Here we go...

861
00:53:38.318 --> 00:53:40.912
- What? Didn't you just head off...?!
- Hold it!


862
00:53:40.988 --> 00:53:42.717
You're being very cowardly about this!

863
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:44.882
Don't sulk about
me getting a better mark!


864
00:53:44.958 --> 00:53:46.949
This has nothing to do with that!

865
00:53:47.027 --> 00:53:49.427
What's up with you, showing up
out of nowhere and bragging?!


866
00:53:49.496 --> 00:53:50.963
And this has nothing to do
with what?!


867
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:54.262
I'm saying that my test score
should have nothing to do with...


868
00:53:54.334 --> 00:53:56.063
...Kaho being in love with you!

869
00:53:56.136 --> 00:53:57.694
- Th-That's not true!
- What?!


870
00:53:57.771 --> 00:53:59.102
That's not true!

871
00:53:59.172 --> 00:54:01.299
- W-Wait! Kaho!
- Kaho!


872
00:54:01.375 --> 00:54:04.572
- She says it's not true.
- Uh! Hang on, Kousuke!


873
00:54:07.547 --> 00:54:09.071
What the...?!

874
00:54:12.786 --> 00:54:15.482
I've got to take
a more basic approach to this.


875
00:54:28.502 --> 00:54:31.835
Why all the ruckus so early
in the morning, sis?


876
00:54:31.905 --> 00:54:35.033
I went back too far!
And I'm late, to boot! Aww!


877
00:54:35.108 --> 00:54:36.837
Makoto! The peaches!

878
00:54:37.477 --> 00:54:38.569
The peaches!

879
00:54:42.883 --> 00:54:43.679
Huh?

880
00:54:48.155 --> 00:54:49.144
Oh, boy...

881
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:51.485
And for the headlock!

882
00:54:53.794 --> 00:54:54.590
Ha!

883
00:54:55.195 --> 00:54:56.628
Huh? What was that?

884
00:54:56.696 --> 00:54:57.663
Amazing...

885
00:54:57.731 --> 00:54:59.665
- Don't look. Just carry on!
- Huh?


886
00:54:59.733 --> 00:55:01.030
You guys need to move!

887
00:55:01.101 --> 00:55:01.800
Year 1 Class 2

888
00:55:01.835 --> 00:55:02.824
Year 1 Class 2
Kaho!


889
00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:03.866
Huh?

890
00:55:03.937 --> 00:55:05.131
I don't exactly know why...

891
00:55:05.205 --> 00:55:07.366
...but she wants you to come
down to the courtyard.


892
00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:08.806
Who does?

893
00:55:08.875 --> 00:55:11.901
Where are we going?!
What're you going to make me do?!


894
00:55:11.978 --> 00:55:14.310
- You'll know when we get there!
- Makoto!


895
00:55:14.381 --> 00:55:15.370
Later!

896
00:55:15.449 --> 00:55:16.916
Okay! Okay! You got me!

897
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:19.810
Is this what she meant by
"come to the courtyard"?


898
00:55:19.886 --> 00:55:20.784
Who knows?

899
00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.388
- Go there!
- Uh, wha...?


900
00:55:29.296 --> 00:55:30.695
That was close!

901
00:55:31.798 --> 00:55:33.288
Ow, ow...!

902
00:55:33.366 --> 00:55:36.028
What the hell are you
guys doing?!


903
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.629
- You're hurting me.
- Huh?


904
00:55:39.673 --> 00:55:40.640
Ah! Oh, no!

905
00:55:42.209 --> 00:55:43.733
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.


906
00:55:45.045 --> 00:55:46.012
Oh!

907
00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:48.877
- You might've sprained it.
- Oh, I'm fine. It's okay.


908
00:55:48.949 --> 00:55:51.816
- It's not okay!
- K-Kousuke!


909
00:55:52.285 --> 00:55:55.686
- Put your hand over my shoulder.
- I-I'm sorry...


910
00:55:56.056 --> 00:55:59.958
- What do you think of this development?
- This could be...


911
00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:01.994
This could be something!

912
00:56:02.062 --> 00:56:02.926
All right!

913
00:56:04.431 --> 00:56:07.093
I sure feel like I did something good!

914
00:56:07.167 --> 00:56:09.533
Oh, what a happy feeling this is!

915
00:56:11.304 --> 00:56:12.100
Hm?

916
00:56:12.172 --> 00:56:13.867
It's changed again!

917
00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.534
Ten? What does "10" mean?

918
00:56:18.345 --> 00:56:19.312
Hm?

919
00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.147
One?

920
00:57:22.709 --> 00:57:26.076
No one's here.
Maybe I'm too early.


921
00:57:34.821 --> 00:57:37.381
There he is...

922
00:57:50.537 --> 00:57:53.335
Um, excuse me!
I have a question for you!


923
00:57:56.209 --> 00:57:57.506
Yuri!

924
00:57:57.577 --> 00:57:59.568
I was wondering who it was.

925
00:57:59.646 --> 00:58:01.045
Why...?

926
00:58:01.248 --> 00:58:03.876
I brought the notebooks up for you.

927
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:06.544
I think you forgot
you had duties today.


928
00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.349
Oh! That's right!

929
00:58:08.421 --> 00:58:09.979
I figured as much.

930
00:58:10.056 --> 00:58:12.490
I hope you appreciate our
friendship here.


931
00:58:12.559 --> 00:58:14.390
So, what's your question?

932
00:58:14.461 --> 00:58:16.292
Oh, uh, it's nothing!

933
00:58:16.363 --> 00:58:17.330
Fine.

934
00:58:22.035 --> 00:58:24.003
- Hey, Yuri...
- Hm?


935
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:26.436
Did you see anyone
on your way up here?


936
00:58:26.506 --> 00:58:27.530
Like who?

937
00:58:27.607 --> 00:58:29.541
Uh, never mind.

938
00:58:30.577 --> 00:58:31.544
All right.

939
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:37.482
Mailbox: I think I was just
asked out. I bet you're envious!


940
00:58:37.517 --> 00:58:41.421
Mailbox: I think I was just asked out. I bet you're
envious! From Kousuke... "I think I was just asked out. "


941
00:58:41.454 --> 00:58:43.012
Mailbox: I'm borrowing your bike.
- Tsuda Huh?


942
00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.559
Oh, please... Who do
you think set it up for you?


943
00:58:48.228 --> 00:58:51.994
I'm borrowing your bike.
- Tsuda


944
00:58:52.565 --> 00:58:54.055
Don't tell me...

945
00:58:55.669 --> 00:58:57.364
Ma...

946
00:58:57.437 --> 00:58:58.734
Ko...

947
00:58:58.805 --> 00:59:00.534
To... There.

948
00:59:00.607 --> 00:59:01.699
Where do you live?

949
00:59:01.775 --> 00:59:03.902
In the south district,
on the other side of the station.


950
00:59:03.977 --> 00:59:06.275
We should probably
go by the hospital.


951
00:59:06.346 --> 00:59:08.871
- What?
- My place is close by.


952
00:59:09.883 --> 00:59:11.874
Makoto, come to think of it...

953
00:59:12.185 --> 00:59:14.949
I passed by a
guy on my way here...

954
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:18.880
It was Chiaki.

955
00:59:22.529 --> 00:59:23.587
Kousuke!

956
00:59:23.963 --> 00:59:27.330
He went home.
Holding hands with that first year girl.


957
00:59:30.303 --> 00:59:31.270
It's gone!

958
00:59:38.278 --> 00:59:39.438
Hey, Kousuke!

959
00:59:39.879 --> 00:59:44.782
Yeah, it's me. Hey, Dad,
I've got a sprain. Think you can fix it?


960
00:59:44.851 --> 00:59:46.478
Oh, it's not me.

961
00:59:47.053 --> 00:59:48.611
Yeah, right away.

962
00:59:49.089 --> 00:59:50.386
I'm sorry.

963
00:59:50.457 --> 00:59:52.982
Please leave a message
after the beep.


964
00:59:53.059 --> 00:59:54.026
Damn!

965
01:00:06.172 --> 01:00:09.437
What should I do?
Should I go back in time?


966
01:00:09.509 --> 01:00:12.478
But it's not like
anything's happened yet.


967
01:00:51.551 --> 01:00:52.074
Huh?

968
01:00:52.519 --> 01:00:53.076
Hm?

969
01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:09.732
Uh, um... Was there
a bike accident here?


970
01:01:09.803 --> 01:01:12.704
No. I don't think so.

971
01:01:13.173 --> 01:01:14.640
Thank you.

972
01:01:14.707 --> 01:01:17.699
An accident, she says. How scary.

973
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:24.541
Kousuke? Where are you now?
Kousuke?


974
01:01:30.723 --> 01:01:31.951
Chiaki.

975
01:01:34.928 --> 01:01:37.226
Kousuke's over at his place.

976
01:01:37.297 --> 01:01:39.265
You guys didn't show up at the field!

977
01:01:39.332 --> 01:01:40.890
- Sorry.
- I'll be waiting.


978
01:01:40.967 --> 01:01:42.594
- Hey, you know...
- Huh?


979
01:01:42.669 --> 01:01:47.231
I've been wanting to ask you
something for a while now.


980
01:01:48.308 --> 01:01:50.776
Do you have fun playing
baseball with me?


981
01:01:50.844 --> 01:01:54.780
- What're you talking about?
- I like playing baseball with you.


982
01:01:54.848 --> 01:01:57.942
For someone who likes baseball,
you sure don't improve much.


983
01:01:58.017 --> 01:01:59.814
Well, all you've got is enthusiasm.

984
01:01:59.886 --> 01:02:01.786
Better than having none.

985
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:05.751
What are you laughing about?

986
01:02:07.026 --> 01:02:10.052
It feels like I'm talking to you
for the first time in a while.


987
01:02:10.129 --> 01:02:12.461
What're you talking about?
We've been talking all day.


988
01:02:12.532 --> 01:02:14.932
Oh, right. I guess.

989
01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:18.027
- You miss me that much?
- W-What're you talking about, stupid?!


990
01:02:18.104 --> 01:02:20.436
Just kidding! Come on!

991
01:02:22.876 --> 01:02:26.744
Actually, there's something
I wanted to ask you as well.


992
01:02:26.813 --> 01:02:27.745
What's that?

993
01:02:27.814 --> 01:02:29.782
It's a really stupid question.

994
01:02:29.849 --> 01:02:31.441
Well, what is it?

995
01:02:32.752 --> 01:02:35.448
- Well...
- Come on. Spit it out.


996
01:02:36.523 --> 01:02:39.492
Have you been time leaping?

997
01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:48.297
You've been time leaping,
haven't you?


998
01:02:49.969 --> 01:02:51.231
Hey, Makoto...

999
01:02:52.071 --> 01:02:53.231
Makoto!

1000
01:02:58.311 --> 01:03:02.805
Actually, there's something
I wanted to ask you as well.


1001
01:03:03.249 --> 01:03:06.116
It's a really stupid question.

1002
01:03:06.953 --> 01:03:08.853
- Well...
- H-Hang on a second!


1003
01:03:08.922 --> 01:03:10.856
- Huh?
- Let's talk about my little sister.


1004
01:03:10.924 --> 01:03:14.257
- Huh? Why?
- You see, my sister is really stupid...!


1005
01:03:14.327 --> 01:03:16.488
Hold on, I was about to...

1006
01:03:19.065 --> 01:03:21.829
Never mind. I'll be waiting then.

1007
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:26.338
How does Chiaki know...?

1008
01:03:28.808 --> 01:03:29.775
Hm?

1009
01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:33.675
Z ero? So these numbers did
represent the number of times...


1010
01:03:33.746 --> 01:03:34.770
...I could time leap.

1011
01:03:35.448 --> 01:03:38.474
I sure wasted my last one
on something lame.


1012
01:03:38.551 --> 01:03:42.180
Oh, well. I guess it's okay,
seeing that Kousuke's all right.


1013
01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:43.516
Hey, Makoto!

1014
01:03:53.366 --> 01:03:55.334
I need to borrow this a bit longer!

1015
01:03:57.937 --> 01:03:59.564
Wait, Kousuke!

1016
01:03:59.639 --> 01:04:00.663
Kousu...!

1017
01:04:03.042 --> 01:04:06.910
Hey! Watch where you're going!
Apologize now! Hey!


1018
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.247
Look!

1019
01:04:12.585 --> 01:04:15.748
Stop, Kousuke! Kousuke!

1020
01:04:20.627 --> 01:04:21.594
Kousuke!

1021
01:04:22.862 --> 01:04:24.090
Stop!

1022
01:04:26.633 --> 01:04:28.567
Kousuke! Kousuke!

1023
01:04:30.803 --> 01:04:32.134
Kousuke!

1024
01:04:32.572 --> 01:04:33.903
Kousuke!

1025
01:04:35.975 --> 01:04:36.907
Ah!

1026
01:04:40.313 --> 01:04:41.905
H
- Hey! Is she all right?

1027
01:04:45.051 --> 01:04:47.611
- She's really badly injured!
- Call an ambulance!


1028
01:04:47.687 --> 01:04:50.349
How did she end up like this?
Can she move?


1029
01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:28.823
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!


1030
01:05:30.096 --> 01:05:32.826
Stop!

1031
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:52.117
Huh?

1032
01:05:54.253 --> 01:05:56.619
What? Huh?!

1033
01:05:58.191 --> 01:06:00.557
W
- What's going on?

1034
01:06:01.494 --> 01:06:03.462
I knew it was you.

1035
01:06:05.498 --> 01:06:06.465
Chiaki!

1036
01:06:08.134 --> 01:06:09.999
What are you doing here?

1037
01:06:10.436 --> 01:06:11.801
Where's Kousuke?

1038
01:06:11.871 --> 01:06:15.671
- Probably still at home.
- What? But he was just here...


1039
01:06:23.983 --> 01:06:26.679
Did you do this?!

1040
01:06:27.286 --> 01:06:29.846
You can time leap too, Chiaki?!

1041
01:06:30.556 --> 01:06:35.084
Would you laugh at me
if I said I come from the future?


1042
01:07:36.389 --> 01:07:37.856
In my time...

1043
01:07:38.925 --> 01:07:42.417
...a device is developed which
allows one to freely travel in time.


1044
01:07:44.463 --> 01:07:48.263
This is it here.
You use it to charge your body.


1045
01:07:49.268 --> 01:07:52.931
I was able to come to this era
thanks to this.


1046
01:07:53.139 --> 01:07:57.599
But without me realizing it,
I had lost it somewhere along the way.


1047
01:07:58.477 --> 01:08:00.104
I panicked.

1048
01:08:00.379 --> 01:08:03.507
I looked everywhere and
I eventually found it.


1049
01:08:03.583 --> 01:08:05.278
In the science lab.

1050
01:08:07.887 --> 01:08:10.412
Although it was already all used up.

1051
01:08:13.159 --> 01:08:16.617
But I'm relieved it was
charged to an idiot.


1052
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:22.133
I had trouble sleeping with fear that
it'd be used for something evil.


1053
01:08:24.203 --> 01:08:25.795
W
- Why?

1054
01:08:27.406 --> 01:08:28.634
Just because...

1055
01:08:30.376 --> 01:08:31.468
Just because?

1056
01:08:35.615 --> 01:08:38.982
Because there was a painting
that I desperately wanted to see.


1057
01:08:39.318 --> 01:08:41.752
No matter how far it was...

1058
01:08:41.821 --> 01:08:44.813
...and whatever sort of place it was at.

1059
01:08:44.891 --> 01:08:47.793
"White Plum and Two Camellias" This painting is temporarily unavailable for
display due to restoration. Tokyo Metropolitan Museum No matter how dangerous...


1060
01:08:47.828 --> 01:08:48.282
"White Plum and Two Camellias" This painting is temporarily
unavailable for display due to restoration. Tokyo Metropolitan Museum


1061
01:08:49.161 --> 01:08:51.129
It was a painting I had to see.

1062
01:08:56.936 --> 01:09:00.235
By my time, it had already
been destroyed.


1063
01:09:00.306 --> 01:09:03.901
And before these times,
its whereabouts were unknown.


1064
01:09:03.976 --> 01:09:07.810
The only place where there was
an accurate record of it...


1065
01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.281
...was in this present time,
in this place, in this season.


1066
01:09:11.984 --> 01:09:14.919
You would be satisfied
just to see it?


1067
01:09:15.988 --> 01:09:18.183
All I needed was to see it.

1068
01:09:20.059 --> 01:09:23.028
I was never going to forget
it for the rest of my life.


1069
01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:34.301
But I guess there's
no point to it now.

1070
01:09:34.373 --> 01:09:35.533
To anything.

1071
01:09:37.576 --> 01:09:38.474
Huh?

1072
01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:42.876
You can't go back?!
What do you mean by that?!


1073
01:09:42.949 --> 01:09:46.646
Like I said, I can't go back
to my time.


1074
01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:48.277
So, why is that?!

1075
01:09:48.788 --> 01:09:53.225
When I went to steal away your bike
that Kousuke was supposed to be...


1076
01:09:53.292 --> 01:09:56.693
...riding, the amount that had been
charged up in me was used up.


1077
01:09:56.762 --> 01:09:58.491
W
- What're you going to do?!

1078
01:09:58.564 --> 01:10:00.031
I'm not doing anything.

1079
01:10:00.099 --> 01:10:02.192
Why would you use it up?!

1080
01:10:02.368 --> 01:10:04.598
Didn't you think to save it?!

1081
01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:06.399
I did save it.

1082
01:10:07.373 --> 01:10:09.773
You may not know this...

1083
01:10:09.842 --> 01:10:14.245
...but Kousuke and that girl
did die once at that crossing.


1084
01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:18.181
A certain someone I know was
sobbing and blaming herself for it...


1085
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.844
...so this was the
only thing I could do.

1086
01:10:24.323 --> 01:10:28.419
I was supposed to go home, but it
turned into summer before I knew it.


1087
01:10:30.062 --> 01:10:34.931
Being with you guys was
just too much fun.


1088
01:10:56.155 --> 01:10:59.522
I saw a river flow across
the land for the first time.


1089
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.928
I rode a bike for the first time.

1090
01:11:04.663 --> 01:11:07.632
I learned for the first time
that the sky was so big.


1091
01:11:09.035 --> 01:11:10.764
But more than anything...

1092
01:11:10.836 --> 01:11:14.135
...I'd never seen any place
with so many people.


1093
01:11:16.876 --> 01:11:18.639
Hey, Chiaki?

1094
01:11:19.945 --> 01:11:23.403
Could it be that there's
some kind of connection...


1095
01:11:23.482 --> 01:11:28.442
...between that painting and
the future you come from?


1096
01:11:32.725 --> 01:11:34.693
Please, tell me.

1097
01:11:39.632 --> 01:11:42.897
I like this era.
There's baseball as well.


1098
01:11:44.036 --> 01:11:47.233
Huh? Baseball's going
to disappear?!


1099
01:11:47.306 --> 01:11:48.796
Where are you looking, idiot.

1100
01:11:48.874 --> 01:11:51.570
Aww, stop messing around.

1101
01:11:53.979 --> 01:11:55.003
That painting...

1102
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:56.013
Huh?

1103
01:11:56.082 --> 01:11:58.175
- That painting...!
- Yeah?


1104
01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.445
You'll be able to see it soon.

1105
01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.354
They're just restoring it right now.

1106
01:12:03.422 --> 01:12:06.414
How about the three of us go?
With Kousuke as well?


1107
01:12:06.492 --> 01:12:08.517
I mean, summer vacation's
about to start!


1108
01:12:08.594 --> 01:12:11.028
Huh, Chiaki? Chiaki?

1109
01:12:12.531 --> 01:12:14.192
Sorry, but I can't.

1110
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.596
Huh?

1111
01:12:16.135 --> 01:12:18.569
I'm going to disappear tomorrow.

1112
01:12:18.637 --> 01:12:20.537
W
- Why?!

1113
01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.831
I'm not supposed to let people
who live in the past...


1114
01:12:23.909 --> 01:12:25.376
...know about time leaps.

1115
01:12:26.278 --> 01:12:28.041
I broke that rule.

1116
01:12:29.181 --> 01:12:31.115
That's why...

1117
01:12:31.183 --> 01:12:33.276
...I won't be able to see you again.

1118
01:12:33.352 --> 01:12:36.378
I'll keep my mouth shut!
I won't tell anyone!


1119
01:12:37.723 --> 01:12:40.214
Chiaki! Where are you?!

1120
01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.050
Hey, Chiaki...

1121
01:12:43.796 --> 01:12:44.888
Chiaki...

1122
01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:47.295
Chiaki...

1123
01:12:48.267 --> 01:12:50.599
You said we'd go to
a night game together!


1124
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:51.931
Sorry.

1125
01:12:52.004 --> 01:12:54.598
And you said we'd go to
a fireworks festival!


1126
01:12:54.673 --> 01:12:55.799
I'm really sorry.

1127
01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:59.470
You don't want to see me in a yukata?!
Is that it?!


1128
01:13:00.045 --> 01:13:02.411
Sorry, I would've liked to have seen that.

1129
01:13:04.216 --> 01:13:05.581
You idiot!

1130
01:13:11.056 --> 01:13:12.182
Chiaki!

1131
01:13:14.326 --> 01:13:15.350
Chiaki!

1132
01:13:21.467 --> 01:13:22.491
- Chiaki!
- Whoa!


1133
01:13:22.568 --> 01:13:23.967
Wait a sec!

1134
01:13:24.036 --> 01:13:25.094
Chiaki!

1135
01:13:52.498 --> 01:13:54.557
Why is Chiaki quitting school?

1136
01:13:54.633 --> 01:13:57.431
Apparently he was in debt
and the mob was after him.


1137
01:13:57.503 --> 01:13:59.801
Is that true?
You sure his parents aren't divorcing?


1138
01:13:59.872 --> 01:14:03.968
I heard he's marrying an older woman.
He got her pregnant.


1139
01:14:04.176 --> 01:14:06.542
What?! No way!

1140
01:14:06.612 --> 01:14:08.580
So what's the story, Makoto?

1141
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:13.577
He's not that kind of guy!

1142
01:14:13.652 --> 01:14:15.813
Apparently, he lost it and
stabbed the guy.


1143
01:14:15.888 --> 01:14:18.584
I heard he beat him to a pulp
with a baseball bat.


1144
01:14:18.724 --> 01:14:21.989
- Or stabbed him with a knife.
- I said he's not like that!


1145
01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:24.959
- Hey, Kousuke!
- Kousuke!


1146
01:14:32.871 --> 01:14:34.839
What the hell's going on?

1147
01:14:37.876 --> 01:14:39.673
It's one thing to not tell me...

1148
01:14:39.745 --> 01:14:42.839
...but to think he'd go
without saying a word to you...


1149
01:14:44.583 --> 01:14:48.349
He did have a thing
for you, after all.


1150
01:14:51.123 --> 01:14:52.852
Did Chiaki say that?

1151
01:14:52.992 --> 01:14:54.323
It was obvious.

1152
01:14:55.394 --> 01:14:56.861
You didn't notice?

1153
01:14:58.063 --> 01:15:01.032
Well, you're awkward about
stuff like that.


1154
01:15:02.234 --> 01:15:06.193
So maybe that's why
he couldn't come out with it.


1155
01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.464
Kousuke...

1156
01:15:09.908 --> 01:15:10.875
Huh?

1157
01:15:11.777 --> 01:15:13.972
- I'm a truly horrible person.
- What?


1158
01:15:14.913 --> 01:15:17.347
He wanted to tell me something...

1159
01:15:17.416 --> 01:15:19.850
...but I pretended
it never happened.


1160
01:15:19.918 --> 01:15:23.046
Why didn't I take what
he said more seriously?


1161
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:27.723
Makoto, what are you talking about?

1162
01:15:29.094 --> 01:15:29.890
H
- Hey!

1163
01:16:11.937 --> 01:16:13.598
Have you calmed down?

1164
01:16:15.441 --> 01:16:21.505
You know, I honestly thought you
were just friends with both...


1165
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.775
...Kousuke and Chiaki.

1166
01:16:27.653 --> 01:16:30.952
I figured you would graduate
without dating either one of them...


1167
01:16:31.023 --> 01:16:34.288
...and you'd end up
with someone else entirely.


1168
01:16:35.527 --> 01:16:38.291
That's what I thought too,
until yesterday.


1169
01:16:39.031 --> 01:16:41.795
But that's not how it is, is it?

1170
01:16:47.373 --> 01:16:50.968
I fell in love for the first time
when I was in senior high.


1171
01:16:52.044 --> 01:16:54.308
We hit it off right from the start.

1172
01:16:55.047 --> 01:16:58.483
It was as if we'd known each other
since we were kids.


1173
01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:01.519
But it fell apart before
we became adults.


1174
01:17:04.089 --> 01:17:05.056
Why?

1175
01:17:06.725 --> 01:17:09.319
Bad timing, I guess.

1176
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:13.496
What is he doing now?

1177
01:17:14.566 --> 01:17:16.864
I wonder what he's up to.

1178
01:17:16.935 --> 01:17:20.166
He promised to come back for me.

1179
01:17:20.272 --> 01:17:24.333
I wasn't intending to wait for him,
but so much time has passed.


1180
01:17:26.478 --> 01:17:30.812
It didn't seem long.
Time flew by quickly.


1181
01:17:34.553 --> 01:17:35.815
But Makoto...

1182
01:17:36.922 --> 01:17:40.483
You're not like me, are you?

1183
01:17:45.497 --> 01:17:48.398
If a guy is
late meeting up with you...

1184
01:17:48.467 --> 01:17:51.527
...you're the type to go run
and look for him, right?


1185
01:18:00.012 --> 01:18:01.912
Makoto! Have some watermelon!

1186
01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.345
Come on, Dear.

1187
01:18:03.415 --> 01:18:06.680
What's up with her? She didn't have
dinner. And now, no watermelon?


1188
01:18:06.752 --> 01:18:08.720
- She's heartbroken.
- You're kidding?!


1189
01:18:08.787 --> 01:18:10.812
Miyuki, it's none of your business.

1190
01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.433
If a guy is
late meeting up with you...

1191
01:18:24.503 --> 01:18:27.472
...you're the type to go run
and look for him, right?


1192
01:18:45.491 --> 01:18:46.458
Why?!

1193
01:18:47.793 --> 01:18:49.761
It's supposed to be at zero.

1194
01:18:54.233 --> 01:18:56.030
It can't be...!

1195
01:18:58.303 --> 01:18:59.770
- Makoto!
- Sis!


1196
01:18:59.838 --> 01:19:01.430
Don't do anything rash, Makoto!

1197
01:19:04.109 --> 01:19:05.076
Makoto!

1198
01:19:08.514 --> 01:19:09.546
That moment,
because Chiaki turned back time...


1199
01:19:09.581 --> 01:19:12.050
Walking home from school, I joked around That
moment, because Chiaki turned back time...


1200
01:19:12.084 --> 01:19:15.053
Walking home from school, I joked around
Then it should be the same for him...


1201
01:19:15.087 --> 01:19:15.220
Walking home from school, I joked around
Oh, Mako!


1202
01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:15.519
Oh, Mako!

1203
01:19:15.554 --> 01:19:16.388
I made you angry for no good reason
Oh, Mako!


1204
01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:16.887
I made you angry for no good reason

1205
01:19:16.922 --> 01:19:18.490
I made you angry for no good reason
Even Chiaki...!


1206
01:19:18.525 --> 01:19:20.549
I made you angry for no good reason

1207
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.129
I wanted to see all of your expressions

1208
01:19:26.164 --> 01:19:28.600
I wanted to see all of your expressions
Go!


1209
01:19:28.635 --> 01:19:29.726
Go!

1210
01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:37.039
Your wide eyes and tear-filled voice

1211
01:19:38.277 --> 01:19:43.977
Even now, they make my heart ache

1212
01:19:45.217 --> 01:19:50.712
Weaving through the passing strangers

1213
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:57.525
I ran after you

1214
01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:00.161
Now, settle down. Quiet!

1215
01:20:00.532 --> 01:20:00.697
Seeking something that wouldn't change

1216
01:20:00.732 --> 01:20:02.367
Seeking something that wouldn't change
Huh? Who are you?


1217
01:20:02.401 --> 01:20:05.771
Seeking something that wouldn't change
- I'm Tsuda. This is Konno... your new classmate Chiaki Mamiya.


1218
01:20:05.804 --> 01:20:06.138
Seeking something that wouldn't change
Konno?


1219
01:20:06.173 --> 01:20:06.503
Konno?

1220
01:20:06.538 --> 01:20:06.672
I won't forget how you looked that day
Konno?


1221
01:20:06.705 --> 01:20:09.107
I won't forget how you looked that
day - Makoto! - He looks a bit rough...


1222
01:20:09.141 --> 01:20:11.543
I won't forget how you looked that day
- Come over here!... but I hope you all get along.


1223
01:20:11.577 --> 01:20:12.077
I won't forget how you looked that day
See ya, Makoto!


1224
01:20:12.112 --> 01:20:12.709
See ya, Makoto!

1225
01:20:12.744 --> 01:20:13.278
Some feelings are more powerful than time
See ya, Makoto!


1226
01:20:13.313 --> 01:20:13.510
Some feelings are more powerful than time

1227
01:20:13.545 --> 01:20:15.714
Some feelings are more powerful than time
Hey, did you hear that?


1228
01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:15.812
Some feelings are more powerful than time

1229
01:20:15.847 --> 01:20:18.050
Some feelings are more powerful than time
He called you by your first name.


1230
01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:18.379
Some feelings are more powerful than time

1231
01:20:18.784 --> 01:20:26.714
I want to be with you right now

1232
01:20:28.293 --> 01:20:32.024
Makoto, how about you
go out with me?


1233
01:20:32.898 --> 01:20:35.867
You were talking about what if
Kousuke got a girlfriend.


1234
01:20:37.002 --> 01:20:40.199
I'm not that ugly, am I?

1235
01:21:03.061 --> 01:21:03.823
Huh?

1236
01:21:22.614 --> 01:21:23.638
Makoto?

1237
01:21:26.284 --> 01:21:27.751
Are you okay?

1238
01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:35.917
I wonder what Chiaki does
on the weekends and stuff?


1239
01:21:36.395 --> 01:21:39.364
It's not like he can
play baseball all day, right?


1240
01:21:42.968 --> 01:21:43.935
Yuri...

1241
01:21:44.102 --> 01:21:45.069
Huh?

1242
01:21:45.637 --> 01:21:49.266
There's something I haven't
been able to tell you.


1243
01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:50.508
What is it?

1244
01:21:52.244 --> 01:21:55.736
I really like Chiaki.

1245
01:21:58.850 --> 01:21:59.817
Sorry.

1246
01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:07.284
Right. That's what I thought.

1247
01:22:08.994 --> 01:22:12.987
I bumped into Chiaki on my way here.
Go see him.


1248
01:22:13.765 --> 01:22:14.732
Okay.

1249
01:22:19.905 --> 01:22:20.872
Makoto.

1250
01:22:22.441 --> 01:22:24.432
Time waits for no one...

1251
01:22:25.544 --> 01:22:26.670
Makoto!

1252
01:22:28.814 --> 01:22:31.476
Kousuke, where's Chiaki?

1253
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:34.348
He got tired of waiting and
went ahead to the field.


1254
01:22:34.419 --> 01:22:37.252
He was pretty irritable. 
We'd better hurry.

1255
01:22:37.322 --> 01:22:40.553
You sure you want to leave your
girlfriend alone? I did work hard to...


1256
01:22:40.625 --> 01:22:42.252
Girlfriend? Whose girlfriend?

1257
01:22:42.327 --> 01:22:45.125
Oh, right.
It's all gone back...


1258
01:22:45.197 --> 01:22:46.755
What are you talking about?

1259
01:22:46.832 --> 01:22:49.164
Uh, well... Oh!

1260
01:22:49.334 --> 01:22:50.301
Huh?

1261
01:22:52.738 --> 01:22:56.071
- Oh no! He saw us!
- He noticed us!


1262
01:22:56.141 --> 01:22:59.076
Hey, why don't we invite them
to join us for baseball?


1263
01:22:59.144 --> 01:23:01.078
- Huh?!
- Go and ask them.


1264
01:23:01.146 --> 01:23:02.113
Why?

1265
01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:05.115
The more people we have,
the more fun it is.


1266
01:23:05.183 --> 01:23:08.448
Hey, do you even know them?

1267
01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.579
Kind of. And another thing...

1268
01:23:11.123 --> 01:23:11.919
Huh?

1269
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:14.481
If you use my bicycle,
it'll cost you 5,000 yen.


1270
01:23:14.559 --> 01:23:15.321
Huh?!

1271
01:23:15.393 --> 01:23:17.520
Got that? 5,000 yen!

1272
01:23:17.596 --> 01:23:19.655
Hey! What's this about?!

1273
01:23:19.731 --> 01:23:23.360
Ask them nicely, "Would you like to
play baseball with us?" Like that.


1274
01:23:24.836 --> 01:23:26.463
- Oh, one more thing!
- Huh?


1275
01:23:26.538 --> 01:23:28.699
I appreciate you waiting for me!

1276
01:23:31.276 --> 01:23:32.140
Makoto!

1277
01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:33.006
What?!

1278
01:23:33.078 --> 01:23:34.705
Watch where you're going!

1279
01:23:36.181 --> 01:23:37.148
Sure!

1280
01:24:57.796 --> 01:25:00.128
You're late. Where's Kousuke?

1281
01:25:00.332 --> 01:25:02.300
- He's not coming.
- Huh?


1282
01:25:02.367 --> 01:25:04.335
What do you mean he's not coming?

1283
01:25:13.078 --> 01:25:14.511
Where'd you find that?

1284
01:25:14.579 --> 01:25:18.140
I mean, do you even know
what it is?


1285
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:19.876
I do.

1286
01:25:20.652 --> 01:25:22.984
- Who told you?
- You did.


1287
01:25:23.054 --> 01:25:26.820
I didn't tell you.
I would never tell you.


1288
01:25:27.225 --> 01:25:29.318
You told me everything.

1289
01:25:29.394 --> 01:25:33.660
About the future you live in,
and what this is...


1290
01:25:33.865 --> 01:25:34.832
Everything.

1291
01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.792
H
- Hey...

1292
01:25:37.936 --> 01:25:39.426
Just as I thought.

1293
01:25:39.905 --> 01:25:41.338
Thank goodness.

1294
01:25:41.539 --> 01:25:43.507
Where did you come from?

1295
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:45.301
The future.

1296
01:25:45.377 --> 01:25:47.675
- Can you leap?
- Not anymore.


1297
01:25:47.913 --> 01:25:49.881
Did I tell you all that?

1298
01:25:49.948 --> 01:25:50.915
Yup.

1299
01:25:50.982 --> 01:25:53.212
- And you believed me?
- Yup.


1300
01:25:53.285 --> 01:25:55.185
- You're an idiot.
- Maybe.


1301
01:25:55.253 --> 01:25:57.346
And you came back to tell me that?

1302
01:25:57.422 --> 01:25:58.320
Yeah.

1303
01:26:04.930 --> 01:26:08.195
Why did I tell you? 
I'm such an idiot!

1304
01:26:57.449 --> 01:27:01.078
That painting.
Go back to the future and enjoy it.


1305
01:27:02.554 --> 01:27:05.580
It's not going to get lost or
burned anymore.


1306
01:27:07.392 --> 01:27:12.591
I'll do my best to make sure
it's there for you in your era.


1307
01:27:13.832 --> 01:27:16.494
Sure, I'd appreciate that.

1308
01:27:20.071 --> 01:27:24.269
I was supposed to go back,
but before I knew it, it was summer.


1309
01:27:26.111 --> 01:27:29.774
I was just having
too much fun with you guys.


1310
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:34.780
That's not how you put it.

1311
01:27:35.587 --> 01:27:37.054
Then what did I say?

1312
01:27:42.027 --> 01:27:42.994
Hm?

1313
01:27:46.564 --> 01:27:48.191
I'm not telling.

1314
01:27:48.666 --> 01:27:50.293
Why not?

1315
01:27:51.269 --> 01:27:53.737
Come on. What did I say?

1316
01:27:54.472 --> 01:27:55.803
I'm not telling.

1317
01:27:55.874 --> 01:27:59.332
You have to tell me.
I have to know now. Come on!


1318
01:28:00.245 --> 01:28:01.712
Hey, look at the lovers.

1319
01:28:02.547 --> 01:28:04.344
Look at the lovers.

1320
01:28:04.416 --> 01:28:07.510
- Well, are we in love or what?
- Look at the lovers.


1321
01:28:07.585 --> 01:28:08.643
Get lost, you idiots!

1322
01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.679
- Let's get out of here!
- Hurry!


1323
01:28:24.836 --> 01:28:26.804
Give my regards to Kousuke.

1324
01:28:26.871 --> 01:28:29.567
Tell him I'm sorry
I couldn't say good-bye to him.


1325
01:28:29.641 --> 01:28:30.471
Sure.

1326
01:28:32.177 --> 01:28:35.943
Oh, and... Makoto?

1327
01:28:41.052 --> 01:28:41.916
What?

1328
01:28:43.188 --> 01:28:46.555
There's something I've been
meaning to tell you.


1329
01:28:50.662 --> 01:28:52.186
Just don't...

1330
01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:58.030
Just don't get yourself hurt
by jumping out in front of things.


1331
01:29:01.039 --> 01:29:02.301
Huh?!

1332
01:29:02.373 --> 01:29:05.934
I mean, you really need to be
more careful. Be more observant.


1333
01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:09.707
Think about what you're doing
before you act. Yeah.


1334
01:29:09.948 --> 01:29:10.915
What's that?

1335
01:29:11.416 --> 01:29:13.907
That's the last thing you have
to say to me?


1336
01:29:13.985 --> 01:29:16.613
You idiot, I'm just worried about you.

1337
01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:23.958
Fine, then! Thank you so much
for worrying about me!


1338
01:29:24.028 --> 01:29:25.859
Now, just go already!

1339
01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:27.397
What are you upset about?!

1340
01:29:27.465 --> 01:29:29.057
Just go!

1341
01:29:30.835 --> 01:29:31.665
See ya.

1342
01:29:32.504 --> 01:29:33.334
See ya!

1343
01:30:09.407 --> 01:30:11.705
I wonder why...

1344
01:30:46.578 --> 01:30:48.546
I'll be waiting for you in the future.

1345
01:30:54.285 --> 01:30:57.982
Okay. I'll be right there,
I'll come running.


1346
01:31:30.488 --> 01:31:31.512
Makoto...

1347
01:31:33.958 --> 01:31:35.016
Makoto...!

1348
01:31:37.362 --> 01:31:39.023
Hey, Makoto!

1349
01:31:51.042 --> 01:31:52.839
What's going on?

1350
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:54.138
It's one thing not to tell me...

1351
01:31:54.212 --> 01:31:56.271
...but nothing to you either?

1352
01:31:56.347 --> 01:31:58.372
All of a sudden
he's dropping out...


1353
01:31:58.449 --> 01:32:00.883
...so he can study abroad?

1354
01:32:00.952 --> 01:32:02.385
Give me a break!

1355
01:32:03.087 --> 01:32:06.056
Oh! Sorry!

1356
01:32:08.559 --> 01:32:10.322
Don't worry about it, Kaho.

1357
01:32:10.695 --> 01:32:13.664
He probably found
something he wanted to do.


1358
01:32:14.098 --> 01:32:16.896
Did he tell you something?

1359
01:32:16.968 --> 01:32:18.765
Nothing, really.

1360
01:32:20.338 --> 01:32:23.273
- There!
- Whoa!


1361
01:32:23.341 --> 01:32:25.673
- Sorry!
- Kaho, your arm's too weak...


1362
01:32:26.377 --> 01:32:27.571
Oh, boy...

1363
01:32:27.912 --> 01:32:31.177
I've also decided on what
I'm going to do.


1364
01:32:31.249 --> 01:32:33.274
Really? What?

1365
01:32:33.351 --> 01:32:35.148
It's a secret!

1366
01:32:35.219 --> 01:32:37.710
Huh? What's that about?

1367
01:32:39.057 --> 01:32:40.820
Maybe some other time.

1368
01:33:16.461 --> 01:33:18.622
Miss Konno!

1369
01:33:18.796 --> 01:33:19.660
Hey!

1370
01:33:21.032 --> 01:33:22.021
There!

1371
01:33:25.770 --> 01:33:27.294
Good throw!

1372
01:33:28.606 --> 01:33:29.971
Here it comes!

1373
01:33:31.676 --> 01:33:32.643
There!

1374
01:33:35.079 --> 01:33:42.652
The Girl Who Leapt Through Time

1375
01:33:55.166 --> 01:34:01.435
<i>As you ran around the baseball field</i>

1376
01:34:01.706 --> 01:34:07.611
<i>You seemed freer than
the clouds in the sky</i>


1377
01:34:08.112 --> 01:34:14.415
<i>Even your blocky writing in your notebook</i>

1378
01:34:14.786 --> 01:34:20.816
<i>Seemed like a light that lit everything</i>

1379
01:34:23.428 --> 01:34:29.628
<i>I didn't understand the emotion of love</i>

1380
01:34:30.034 --> 01:34:35.267
<i>This moment in time that will never return</i>

1381
01:34:35.606 --> 01:34:45.606
<i>Taught me the true meaning of love</i>

1382
01:34:48.085 --> 01:34:54.513
<i>I'm going to burn into my heart
the memories of days I spent with you</i>


1383
01:34:54.592 --> 01:35:00.827
<i>So I never have to remember them</i>

1384
01:35:00.965 --> 01:35:07.427
<i>Even if I someday fall
in love with someone else</i>


1385
01:35:07.505 --> 01:35:17.505
<i>You will always be special and precious</i>

1386
01:35:18.082 --> 01:35:26.888
<i>And this season will come around again</i>

1387
01:35:27.191 --> 01:35:33.255
<i>The fact that I met you
in the vastness of time</i>


1388
01:35:33.664 --> 01:35:39.762
<i>Has made me stronger than anything else</i>

1389
01:35:40.071 --> 01:35:46.306
<i>Running towards tomorrow in a daze
and I just so happen to get there</i>


1390
01:35:46.744 --> 01:35:56.744
<i>You will always be special and precious</i>

1391
01:35:57.421 --> 01:36:06.352
<i>And this season will come once more</i>

1392
01:36:28.052 --> 01:36:38.052
<i>That summer you promised
me that you'd never forget</i>


1393
01:36:40.331 --> 01:36:50.331
<i>Time has passed, and only
now my tears begin to flow</i>


1394
01:36:57.248 --> 01:37:03.778
<i>I'm going to burn into my heart
the memories of days I spent with you</i>


1395
01:37:03.854 --> 01:37:10.020
<i>So I never have to remember them</i>

1396
01:37:10.394 --> 01:37:16.731
<i>Even if I someday fall
in love with someone else</i>


1397
01:37:16.867 --> 01:37:26.867
<i>You will always be special and precious</i>

1398
01:37:27.845 --> 01:37:36.913
<i>And this season will come around again</i>
