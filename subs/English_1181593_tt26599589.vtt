-We were a Black Ops team frequently
on special assignment behind enemy lines.


4
00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.944
We trusted each other without question.

5
00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:33.893
We had to . . .

6
00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:35.978
or we wouldn't make it home alive.

00:01:45.713 --> 00:01:50.120
The intelligence community was hot
on the trail of Nasir al-Wuhayshi,


9
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.307
the second in command of Al
-Qaeda.

10
00:01:53.327 --> 00:01:56.108
One of his lieutenants
had been turned by the CIA


11
00:01:56.188 --> 00:01:58.162
and was willing to give up
Nasir's location


12
00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:00.174
in exchange for amnesty.

13
00:02:01.243 --> 00:02:04.144
Our team was sent in
to extract this intel,


14
00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.946
but something about this whole thing
just didn't sit right with me.


15
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.769
Things were too quiet,

16
00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:12.479
too easy.

17
00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:19.953
-That's our, guy.

18
00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:21.255
All clear.

19
00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:22.530
Let's go.

-Allahu Akbar!

Ambush, down, down,
down, down. Down. Get down!


22
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.013
Fire, fire, fire.
Logan's hit!

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.887

-there might be more coming!
-We have incoming!


29
00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:53.326

Let's go. Come on, let's go.

-On this mission, I learned one thing,
nightmares really do come true.


37
00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:28.741
I'm Denver McCabe

38
00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:31.491
and this is my story.

39
00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:41.572

[music]

41
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.523
After that mission went sideways,

42
00:03:55.923 --> 00:03:59.787
me and my men ran for our lives.

43
00:04:00.228 --> 00:04:01.392
Since then,

44
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.631
I found myself never able to stop running.

45
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:11.079
I was once one of the most
respected men in my field.


46
00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:14.741
If you had told me back then
where my choices,


47
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.641
my pride, and my response to the guilt
that I felt would cause me to end up,


48
00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:22.556
I would have laughed at you,

49
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:28.470
but when I met my worst fears head-on,
I soon discovered


50
00:04:28.596 --> 00:04:33.288
that I wasn't nearly as strong of a man
as I thought I was.


51
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:40.871
The flashbacks, the nightmares consumed me

52
00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:43.415
and I couldn't control myself.

53
00:04:47.984 --> 00:04:50.523
My poor wife bore
the brunt of the pain.

54
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.831
When I think of the times
that I made that little woman cry,


55
00:04:56.084 --> 00:04:59.159
it causes my face to burn with shame.

56
00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:02.043
Without a word late in the night,

57
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:05.513
I left her and never looked back.

58
00:05:06.047 --> 00:05:09.682
She didn't deserve the monster
that I had become.


59
00:05:11.775 --> 00:05:15.527
I ran for months fast and hard,

60
00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:17.491
but before long,

61
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:21.834
I was living on the street
and completely worthless to society,


62
00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:27.064
but I took advantage of the generosity
of others as much as possible.


63
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:32.530
A man's got to be able to try
to survive and keep on running.


64
00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:37.597
My life was a mess.

65
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.003
I spent most of the money on booze

66
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:43.605
so that I could try to bury my pain
in the bottom of a bottle.


67
00:05:43.996 --> 00:05:46.360
I thought I could drown my memories,

68
00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:48.875
but whenever I would come to,

69
00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:51.752
I'd find myself in some gutter,

70
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:52.932
filthy,

71
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:54.301
wretched,

72
00:05:54.448 --> 00:05:57.246
and still halted by my past.

[gunshots]
[screams]


74
00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:08.949
The mission had failed.

75
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.620
It was my fault.

76
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.550
I should have foreseen that ambush.

77
00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.432
I knew something was off from the get-go.

78
00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:20.790
I could feel it in my gut.

79
00:06:22.403 --> 00:06:23.641

Keep your head down!

Over here, hurry up.

00:06:39.244 --> 00:06:40.819
Put pressure on it.

-Are we clear?
-Yes, we're clear.

-I got two high in the back.

89
00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:48.944
I got ammo, I can hold them off.
Y'all got to go.


90
00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:49.962
-We are not leaving you here.

91
00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.734
We came in together,
we're going out together.


92
00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:52.874
-Guys, I'm going to slow you down.

93
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:54.576
I'm good on ammo, 
I can hold them off.

00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:58.771
-Okay, where are we?

97
00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.362
-I'm not sure, let me check.

98
00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:01.711
-More hostiles inbound!

[gunshots]

100
00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:05.074
-Boys, we're cut off
from our extraction point.


101
00:07:05.155 --> 00:07:07.574
We're gonna have to find
another place to get out of here.


102
00:07:07.655 --> 00:07:10.503
According to this map, there is
a farmhouse two clicks to the north.


103
00:07:10.584 --> 00:07:12.961
We've gotta head in that direction.
Hand me your comms.


104
00:07:15.674 --> 00:07:17.108
Bravo Team 1,

105
00:07:17.448 --> 00:07:18.828
we've got a man down.

106
00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:25.190
We've got a new extraction,
southwest by northwest 4796243.


107
00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:27.182
-We can't hold them for much longer!
-Allahu Akbar!


108
00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:29.279
-They're closing in, guys.
They're closing in.


109
00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:31.645
-Go, go, go, I got them.
I'll hold them off.


110
00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:34.265
Go, go. Go on, get out of here.

111
00:07:34.346 --> 00:07:36.011
Go, go, I'll cover you!

112
00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:38.496
I'll cover you, go, go, go.

113
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.141
[gunshots]

114
00:07:46.288 --> 00:07:47.606
-Allahu Akbar!

115
00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:55.798
-I remember hearing the gunfire
in the distance go silent.


116
00:07:56.996 --> 00:07:59.115
I knew that meant only one thing,

117
00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:04.287
Logan was dead,
and I blamed myself for that.


118
00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:06.823
We should have died together.

119
00:08:07.549 --> 00:08:09.874
We should have never left him there.

120
00:08:10.144 --> 00:08:15.237
[music]

121
00:08:15.318 --> 00:08:19.165
After months of searching,
I finally found his grave.


122
00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:25.056
The guilt and regret that washed over me
is impossible to describe.


123
00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:28.786
I lost count on the times
I went to visit him,


124
00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:32.018
and with tears,
begged him to forgive me.


125
00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:35.043
He had laid down his life

126
00:08:35.176 --> 00:08:36.578
so that we could live.

127
00:08:37.944 --> 00:08:39.304
And every time I remembered

128
00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:42.690
how he sacrificed himself
without hesitation,


129
00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:44.591
it broke me even more.

130
00:08:45.422 --> 00:08:48.594
He was a good man
with so much to live for.


131
00:08:50.037 --> 00:08:52.694
Why should a man
like that have to die?

132
00:08:53.148 --> 00:08:54.797
It should have been me . . .

133
00:08:58.073 --> 00:09:00.734
but Logan was more than a good man.

134
00:09:01.872 --> 00:09:04.097
He was a Christian.

135
00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:07.300
I lost track of the times
at night out on patrol


136
00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:10.875
that he would tell me of the change
that God had made in him.


137
00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:14.356
He often tried to get me
to give my life to Christ,


138
00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:17.172
but I told him that wasn't for me.

139
00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.317
Now he was dead

140
00:09:19.537 --> 00:09:21.847
and I was still here.

141
00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:29.998
[music]

142
00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:31.873
I needed another drink.

143
00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:34.816
I needed to bury my pain.

144
00:09:35.358 --> 00:09:38.876
I needed relief
from the regret and the shame,


145
00:09:39.264 --> 00:09:41.421
but when you're homeless and broke,

146
00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:43.904
that's easier said than done.

147
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:48.800
The rejection from society
made me angry and frustrated,


148
00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:52.080
but strangely enough,

149
00:09:52.897 --> 00:09:55.273
I eventually came to accept it.

150
00:09:56.726 --> 00:10:02.899
Anybody that had done the things
that I had done deserved nothing less.


151
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.082
Before long,
the booze wasn't strong enough,


152
00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:11.044
I needed something more.

153
00:10:11.962 --> 00:10:13.452
I'd heard about Marco,

154
00:10:13.556 --> 00:10:16.816
a man on the street that could get you
anything you wanted.


155
00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:19.886
Of course, it came with a price.

156
00:10:20.657 --> 00:10:22.214
The rules were simple.

157
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.988
If I helped him,

158
00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:25.809
he would help me,

159
00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:27.977
so I agreed

160
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:30.152
and he helped me.

161
00:10:30.744 --> 00:10:33.250
He helped me lose track of time.

162

This cycle of crime

Marco took good care of me

who could always get the job done,

was to fulfill Cooper's dying request.

324
00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:58.679
[music - no audible dialogue this scene]

325
00:20:40.227 --> 00:20:44.427
To look at that woman and her son
knowing that I was the one


326
00:20:44.508 --> 00:20:46.660
who was responsible for his death.

327
00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:51.473
This is what haunted me most of all.

328
00:20:53.475 --> 00:20:55.371
Now I lay broken,

329
00:20:55.776 --> 00:21:02.067
helpless in absolute bondage
to the guilt of my past,


330
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.982
but little did I realize

331
00:21:05.207 --> 00:21:09.361
that my precious wife
never stopped praying for me.


332
00:21:09.832 --> 00:21:11.716
She didn't know where I was,

333
00:21:11.808 --> 00:21:13.786
but she knew God did.

334
00:21:14.154 --> 00:21:15.868
She couldn't reach me,

335
00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:18.147
but she believed that God could.

336
00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.774
I needed help,

337
00:21:20.994 --> 00:21:22.376
and I knew it.

338
00:21:22.474 --> 00:21:24.607
Something had to change.

339
00:21:25.487 --> 00:21:29.902
One day I saw a flyer
on the ground for a recovery center.


340
00:21:30.141 --> 00:21:31.565
To be honest,

341
00:21:31.711 --> 00:21:33.982
I'd always been skeptical
of these kinds of places,


342
00:21:34.062 --> 00:21:37.313
but I figured
it wouldn't hurt to give it a try.


343
00:21:38.466 --> 00:21:40.526
When it was my turn to share,

344
00:21:41.012 --> 00:21:44.273
it was like a floodgate
opened up inside of me.


345
00:21:46.249 --> 00:21:48.433
-I've seen some good men die.

346
00:21:50.455 --> 00:21:54.587
I still see their faces
. . . in my head!

347
00:21:56.235 --> 00:21:59.626
Every night I see their faces
and it just won't go away.


348
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.720
It's driving me crazy;
I don't know how much more I can take!


349
00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:05.927
-It's okay. Really, it's okay.

350
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.279
Let's try to work on these emotions.

351
00:22:08.366 --> 00:22:12.926
These things are things that really
can hurt us from the past here.


352
00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:16.193
Let's try to work on our breathing, okay?
Let's breathe in.


353
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:18.953
Breathe out.

354
00:22:21.313 --> 00:22:22.720
Come on, everybody, let's help Denver.

355
00:22:22.846 --> 00:22:24.050
Breathe in.

356
00:22:26.573 --> 00:22:27.859
Breathe out.

357
00:22:30.753 --> 00:22:32.250
There now.

358
00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:34.770
Is that better?

359
00:22:35.613 --> 00:22:36.873
-I'm good.

360
00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:41.395
The counselor was sincere,

361
00:22:41.579 --> 00:22:43.926
but my needs were
way out of his league.

362
00:22:44.647 --> 00:22:46.924
I scared most of the people there.

363
00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:50.844
But there was one man
who took an interest in me -


364
00:22:51.262 --> 00:22:52.527
a fellow veteran.

365
00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:55.953
We had a lot in common
as we swapped war stories


366
00:22:56.033 --> 00:22:58.238
and talked about our struggles.

367
00:22:58.646 --> 00:23:01.067
He had compassion on me.

368
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:06.247
He told me that his mama raised him
to always do good to others in need.


369
00:23:06.423 --> 00:23:10.872
To do unto others
as you'd have them do unto you.


370
00:23:11.287 --> 00:23:12.910
He wanted to help me out

371
00:23:13.051 --> 00:23:14.908
And get me back on my feet.

372
00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:18.027
He couldn't do much,
but he worked construction


373
00:23:18.107 --> 00:23:21.985
and told me that his boss had just bought
an old house from a foreclosure.


374
00:23:22.342 --> 00:23:24.984
They were planning to flip it
in a couple of months,


375
00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:26.401
but for now,

376
00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:27.934
nobody would be there.

377
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.220
I thanked him

378
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.555
because at least it was a roof
over my head for a few weeks


379
00:23:33.716 --> 00:23:35.433
while I tried to sort out my life.

380
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:45.540
[music]

381
00:24:19.187 --> 00:24:21.669
Down the street was a Catholic church.

382
00:24:22.231 --> 00:24:24.564
Maybe here I could find the answers

383
00:24:24.644 --> 00:24:26.544
and the peace that I was looking for.

384
00:24:29.498 --> 00:24:32.606
I never really thought about
having a relationship with God,


385
00:24:32.902 --> 00:24:38.382
but I kept hearing Logan's voice
in my mind over and over again,


386
00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:41.332
telling me that Jesus loved me

387
00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:44.109
and that I needed to
give my life to him.

388
00:24:44.907 --> 00:24:47.346
Even Cooper talked with me about my soul.

389
00:24:47.807 --> 00:24:49.415
When he faced death,

390
00:24:49.557 --> 00:24:51.260
he was ready to meet God

391
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.763
and believed he would see his family again
in heaven someday.


392
00:24:56.338 --> 00:24:59.131
Both of my men had found peace.

393
00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:02.745
Maybe this is what I needed,

394
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.685
but where could I find Him?

395
00:25:06.989 --> 00:25:08.353
Who was He?

396
00:25:08.947 --> 00:25:11.244
How could He love somebody like me?

397
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.665
What did all this mean?

398
00:25:14.467 --> 00:25:18.568
I believed He was real,
but I didn't understand any of it.


399
00:25:20.441 --> 00:25:22.567
If He really cared,

400
00:25:22.801 --> 00:25:27.785
why did He let me suffer so much pain
through war and killings?


401
00:25:29.156 --> 00:25:30.675
Whoever He was,

402
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.493
He felt a million miles away.

403
00:25:41.074 --> 00:25:42.429
As I sat there,

404
00:25:43.325 --> 00:25:48.158
I felt just as empty and lifeless
as the building and the statues


405
00:25:48.317 --> 00:25:49.709
that surrounded me.

406

[music]

407
00:26:07.486 --> 00:26:10.675
-I couldn't help but noticing you
around the church, my son.


408
00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:14.118
You seem to be hurt deeply.

409
00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:18.143
It seems like something's weighing . . .
heavily on your soul.


410
00:26:18.382 --> 00:26:20.377
Is there something I can help you with?

411
00:26:22.044 --> 00:26:23.663
-I don't see how.

412
00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:31.772
-I can just imagine
how many people have told me,


413
00:26:31.835 --> 00:26:33.384
"I don't see how,"

414
00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:38.294
but if they would just share and open up
their feelings to someone else -


415
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:43.151
there might be an avenue
that we can take that might help you


416
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:47.040
get through this time of anguish
that you're in.


417
00:26:47.502 --> 00:26:50.770
-I've tried just about everything,
to be honest with you.


418
00:26:51.656 --> 00:26:54.908
-You look like a former military man.

419
00:26:55.649 --> 00:26:59.062
I've dealt with a lot of people
that come through our church


420
00:26:59.205 --> 00:27:02.105
that they seem to have lost their way

421
00:27:02.298 --> 00:27:04.357
while they were serving
in Afghanistan . . .

422
00:27:04.473 --> 00:27:06.229
Could you be one of those type?

423
00:27:09.671 --> 00:27:12.745
-I reckon. I got a lot of people killed,
I know that.


424
00:27:12.887 --> 00:27:15.666
-Yes, but you also probably
saved a lot of people.


425
00:27:15.765 --> 00:27:17.791
The Patriot Saint of Warriors

426
00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:23.631
would probably deem you as a hero.

427
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:27.120
-I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a hero.

428
00:27:27.723 --> 00:27:29.192
I can tell you that.

429
00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:33.025
-I bet you if we pray to Mary,

430
00:27:33.106 --> 00:27:36.139
Mary can intercede on your behalf
and get you on the right path.


431
00:27:36.231 --> 00:27:38.057
-Pray to Mary?
-Sure.


432
00:27:38.381 --> 00:27:40.362
Mary is the mother of God.

433
00:27:41.513 --> 00:27:42.809
With her,

434
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:48.446
she has an open forum right
to the Creator of the universe.


435
00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.247
If anybody can get you back on a path
where you feel


436
00:27:52.402 --> 00:27:57.434
like you've redeemed yourself
and you're once again whole,


437
00:27:57.753 --> 00:28:01.092
wouldn't that be worth
a bit of your time?

438
00:28:02.892 --> 00:28:04.796
-Redeem myself?

439
00:28:05.394 --> 00:28:07.408
Me, a hero?

440
00:28:08.087 --> 00:28:12.719
I could tell he was trying to be kind,
but the more that man spoke,


441
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.063
the more confused I became.

442
00:28:15.807 --> 00:28:18.512
I don't even think
he believed in it himself.

443
00:28:19.057 --> 00:28:21.789
There was no light in his eyes,

444
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.494
just the same emptiness
that was in his church.


445
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:31.795
Nothing about God made
any sense to me at all.


446
00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:37.193
He gave me what he called a rosary
saying that it would restore my life


447
00:28:37.273 --> 00:28:39.221
as I prayed through Mary.

448
00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:43.119
But how could a handful of beads
and a dead woman


449
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.789
help me get closer to God?

450
00:28:46.618 --> 00:28:49.316
He kept telling me
that I should be proud of the service


451
00:28:49.396 --> 00:28:51.126
I gave for my country,

452
00:28:51.564 --> 00:28:53.357
but no matter what
he said . . .

453
00:28:53.521 --> 00:28:55.235
one thing was for sure -

454
00:28:55.837 --> 00:28:57.092
I was no hero.

I knew I could do

to end all of my pain and suffering.

to ease the pain.

00:30:36.755 --> 00:30:38.609
and I deserved it.

482
00:30:39.684 --> 00:30:42.724
This world would be
a whole lot better place


483
00:30:42.804 --> 00:30:44.025
with me gone.

-Well, Lord, I believe you want me
to go to soulwinning on this street today.


486
00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:10.162
So, would you please open someone's heart
to hear the gospel?


487
00:31:10.824 --> 00:31:12.606
We've had some good visits so far,

488
00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:17.867
but please use me to reach that one soul
who really needs you.


489
00:31:18.153 --> 00:31:20.334
Thank you. In Jesus' name, Amen.

-Hey, my name is Warren.

494
00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.706
I'm visiting from the Calvary
Baptist Church here in town.


495
00:31:40.786 --> 00:31:41.793
I just thought I'd stop by.

496
00:31:41.913 --> 00:31:43.824
I'm out in the neighborhood knocking doors.

497

-I'm kind of busy right now.

498
00:31:47.074 --> 00:31:50.048
-I'm sorry, sir, I couldn't hear you.
A car was going by.


499
00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:55.429
-Say what?
-I said I'm kind of busy right now.


500
00:31:55.802 --> 00:31:56.882
-Well,

501
00:31:57.612 --> 00:32:00.038
I'd love to take the time
and share Christ with you.


502
00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.856
There's always hope in Jesus.

503
00:32:02.063 --> 00:32:04.395
If I could come back sometime,
I'd love to do that.


504
00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:08.410
-I'm . . . I'm . . . Whatever.
-Whatever?


505
00:32:08.529 --> 00:32:10.672
All right, man.
Hey, listen, let me leave you something.


506
00:32:11.692 --> 00:32:13.233
You have a good one, all right?

507
00:32:18.395 --> 00:32:20.541
-Maybe I shouldn't have turned away
whoever that was,


508
00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:23.070
but I was done.

509
00:32:23.868 --> 00:32:25.747
I just wanted to be left alone.

[music]

511
00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:29.071
I heard whispers from the darkness
calling out to me,


512
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:34.134
promising rest and silence from the pain.

-Good evening, sir.

516
00:35:41.691 --> 00:35:44.449
Listen, you're probably
not going to believe this,


517
00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.897
but I really believe God
wants me to talk to you.


518
00:35:50.262 --> 00:35:51.954
-I think so too.

519
00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:56.532
I think so too.

520
00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.992
-Can I take a few moments

521
00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.467
and share few verses about hope
in Christ with you?


522
00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:02.325
-Yes.
-Come on out.


523
00:36:02.468 --> 00:36:03.750
What's your name, man?

524
00:36:04.118 --> 00:36:06.507
-My name is Denver.
-Denver? I'm Warren.


525
00:36:06.634 --> 00:36:07.626
-Denver McCabe.

526
00:36:07.737 --> 00:36:09.272
-Nice to meet you, Denver.

527
00:36:10.404 --> 00:36:11.233
It's good to see you, man,

528
00:36:11.261 --> 00:36:14.724
I came back because I actually believe
God wants me to show this to you.


529
00:36:15.055 --> 00:36:18.015
It's awkward for me
as it probably is for you, but Denver,


530
00:36:18.096 --> 00:36:20.825
there's a couple of verses
I'd like to share with you


531
00:36:20.975 --> 00:36:22.134
about eternal life.

532
00:36:22.214 --> 00:36:23.906
How you can be sure that
if something happened,


533
00:36:23.928 --> 00:36:25.468
you're going to be with Jesus.

534
00:36:25.554 --> 00:36:27.636
All through the New Testament,
it talks about it,


535
00:36:27.754 --> 00:36:30.381
but I'm going to share some
verses with you . . .

536
00:36:31.969 --> 00:36:36.235
-That old man had no idea
how close I was to pulling the trigger.


537
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:42.599
He took his worn leather Bible
and began showing me that there was hope.


538
00:36:43.532 --> 00:36:48.757
"For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son,


539
00:36:48.902 --> 00:36:51.487
that whosoever believeth in Him"

540
00:36:52.057 --> 00:36:53.501
that included me -

541
00:36:53.732 --> 00:36:57.927
"should not perish
but have everlasting life."


542
00:36:58.707 --> 00:37:02.098
Being brought close to death
gave me a greater clarity


543
00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:04.157
like I'd never had before.

544
00:37:04.496 --> 00:37:06.596
My life was spared.

545
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.806
This very moment,
God was reaching out to me.


546
00:37:10.552 --> 00:37:14.516
This man showed me from the Bible
what my problem really was.


547
00:37:14.902 --> 00:37:16.195
I was a sinner.

548
00:37:16.851 --> 00:37:19.098
I didn't argue with him about that.

549
00:37:19.229 --> 00:37:24.027
He showed me that the wages
or penalty of sin is death in hell.


550
00:37:24.428 --> 00:37:26.817
I knew this is what I deserved,

551
00:37:27.143 --> 00:37:28.386
but then he showed me

552
00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:33.441
that Jesus Christ was the answer
through His sacrifice on the Cross.


553
00:37:33.522 --> 00:37:36.214
I remembered how Logan
gave his life for me and Cooper


554
00:37:36.355 --> 00:37:38.701
and it all began to
make sense . . .

555
00:37:38.872 --> 00:37:41.746
Jesus died so that I could live!

556
00:37:41.855 --> 00:37:44.157
Three days later, He rose again

557
00:37:44.244 --> 00:37:47.601
and now freely offered me
the gift of eternal life.


558
00:37:48.553 --> 00:37:50.656
-Denver, if you were to have
that gift of eternal life


559
00:37:50.792 --> 00:37:52.857
and you were to
die, where would you go?

560
00:37:54.815 --> 00:37:56.066
-I'd go to Heaven.

561
00:37:56.162 --> 00:37:59.907
-Exactly. If you don't have that gift,
what's going to happen to you?


562
00:38:00.276 --> 00:38:01.772
-I'd go to Hell.

563
00:38:01.891 --> 00:38:04.193
-Would you like that gift of eternal life?

564
00:38:04.493 --> 00:38:06.653
[music]

565
00:38:06.765 --> 00:38:10.527
-Jesus stood in Heaven
with His arms open wide in love


566
00:38:10.669 --> 00:38:12.426
ready to receive me.

567
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:15.653
"For whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord


568
00:38:15.773 --> 00:38:17.582
shall be saved."

569
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:20.543
Could it really be this simple?

570
00:38:21.138 --> 00:38:23.176
As this man talked to me,

571
00:38:23.262 --> 00:38:25.564
my heart burned within me.

572
00:38:25.944 --> 00:38:28.872
God wasn't a million miles away anymore.

573
00:38:29.088 --> 00:38:32.615
He was right here with us, calling me.

574
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:35.294
He really loved me.

575
00:38:36.423 --> 00:38:38.985
For the first time in my life,

576
00:38:39.527 --> 00:38:41.196
I found hope.

577
00:38:41.804 --> 00:38:43.489
I found grace.

578
00:38:45.184 --> 00:38:47.145
I found Jesus.

00:38:47.252 --> 00:38:51.200
[music]

580
00:38:55.524 --> 00:38:56.580
God,

581
00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:02.187
I need you right now.

582
00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:08.241
My life is a mess.

583
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:12.216
I've tried everything,

584
00:39:13.446 --> 00:39:15.045
I've done everything . . .

585
00:39:19.616 --> 00:39:22.184
I've got nobody else to turn to.

586
00:39:25.435 --> 00:39:28.437
I believe what You said

587
00:39:29.374 --> 00:39:30.944
about that gift,

588
00:39:32.705 --> 00:39:34.364
and I want that gift.

589
00:39:36.697 --> 00:39:38.242
I need that gift.

590
00:39:38.824 --> 00:39:40.756
I need that eternal life

591
00:39:41.094 --> 00:39:42.908
You were talking about.

592
00:39:43.918 --> 00:39:45.046
Please,

593
00:39:45.234 --> 00:39:46.946
I'm asking you,

594
00:39:47.355 --> 00:39:52.068
I'm begging you to save me right now!

595
00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.526
I don't want to go to Hell.

596
00:39:55.279 --> 00:39:57.772
Oh, God, I don't want to
go to hell . . .

597
00:39:58.102 --> 00:40:00.202
Would you please save me?

598
00:40:01.021 --> 00:40:02.374
I beg you.

599
00:40:02.469 --> 00:40:04.894
I beg you in Jesus' name,

600
00:40:06.482 --> 00:40:07.873
save me,

601
00:40:10.054 --> 00:40:12.203
Amen.

-Denver, let me ask you,
did you mean that?

-Yes.
-Amen.

00:40:21.635 --> 00:40:23.175
Thank you for talking to me!

607
00:40:23.429 --> 00:40:26.472
-Yes, sir. But you don't thank me,
you thank God.


608
00:40:26.877 --> 00:40:29.683
Tonight when you go to bed
and you put your head in the pillow,


609
00:40:29.874 --> 00:40:31.738
I want you to think about
the flames of hell,


610
00:40:31.865 --> 00:40:35.062
the burning, the torment
and realize you are not going there.


611
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.258
Jesus saved you.

612
00:40:36.376 --> 00:40:38.044
Learn to say, "Thank you, Jesus."

613
00:40:38.556 --> 00:40:39.356
Can you do that for me?

614
00:40:39.406 --> 00:40:41.036
-Yes, sir.
-God bless you, buddy.

-The transformation that comes
through true salvation


618
00:41:04.724 --> 00:41:07.031
began in me that very day.

619
00:41:07.255 --> 00:41:09.567
The load of sin had been lifted.

620
00:41:10.058 --> 00:41:14.454
The pain that had consumed me
for so long was finally gone.


621
00:41:15.153 --> 00:41:17.693
I was a new creature in Christ.

622
00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:21.121
Now I had a reason to live.

623
00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:23.684
God led the right people into my life

624
00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:27.483
to help me to grow in the Lord
and get me back on my feet.


625
00:41:32.105 --> 00:41:33.716
The more I read my Bible,

626
00:41:34.192 --> 00:41:36.743
the more changes he produced in me.

627
00:41:37.276 --> 00:41:41.319
There was no longer a desire
for alcohol or drugs.


628
00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:46.548
God in His grace and mercy
began helping me and guiding me.


629
00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:51.171
He filled my heart
with a desire for Him and His Word.


630
00:41:51.318 --> 00:41:52.758
Little by little,

631
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:56.726
the sins that had defined
my life for so long


632
00:41:56.897 --> 00:41:58.406
He began to take away.

633
00:41:59.189 --> 00:42:03.064
The loneliness was gone,
the guilt was gone,


634
00:42:03.968 --> 00:42:06.852
the nightmares slowly faded,

635
00:42:07.158 --> 00:42:09.916
and never before had I
felt such peace . . .

636
00:42:14.928 --> 00:42:19.310
The thought of facing my wife
after all I had put her through


637
00:42:19.556 --> 00:42:21.882
filled me with uncertainty.

638
00:42:22.526 --> 00:42:25.122
Shame clawed at my insides

639
00:42:25.253 --> 00:42:28.730
when I remembered my last words
of anger and abuse


640
00:42:28.885 --> 00:42:32.267
before I walked out on her
all those years ago.


641
00:42:33.059 --> 00:42:35.637
But would she really take me back?

642
00:42:35.967 --> 00:42:39.170
She said she would, but how?

643
00:42:39.259 --> 00:42:40.909
Why would she?

644
00:42:41.305 --> 00:42:44.998
I gave her nothing but
fear and anguish . . .

645
00:42:48.598 --> 00:42:50.489
But the flag was out.

646
00:42:51.438 --> 00:42:55.522
Was this her way of telling me
that I was welcome home?


647
00:42:56.257 --> 00:43:01.411
I couldn't bear to think of her reaction
to seeing me after all this time.


648
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:04.205
She had every right to hate me,

649
00:43:04.588 --> 00:43:07.467
but Jesus Christ had saved me.

650
00:43:07.709 --> 00:43:09.367
The least I could do

651
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:13.363
was let her know
that her prayers had been answered.


652
00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.809
I was different.

653
00:43:15.922 --> 00:43:18.914
[music]

654
00:44:28.012 --> 00:44:31.918
God has now given me
the opportunity to reach those


655
00:44:31.998 --> 00:44:34.599
who are just like how I once was.

656
00:44:35.424 --> 00:44:38.056
I've become a preacher of the gospel,

657
00:44:38.273 --> 00:44:41.475
a messenger of hope to those in need.

658
00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.183
I testify often

659
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:49.960
of what God did for me
through the saving power of Jesus Christ,


660
00:44:50.195 --> 00:44:53.920
bringing miraculous deliverance
from a life of homelessness,


661
00:44:54.154 --> 00:44:55.154
crime,

662
00:44:55.337 --> 00:44:56.337
prison,

663
00:44:56.424 --> 00:45:00.107
and years of addiction
to the vices of sin.


664
00:45:02.029 --> 00:45:05.308
I love sharing how that
one of the greatest days in my life


665
00:45:05.444 --> 00:45:06.982
after I got saved

666
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:09.910
was when I was able to visit
the veteran cemetery


667
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:13.325
without the guilt and regrets of the past.

668
00:45:14.204 --> 00:45:15.547
I was forgiven

669
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:21.368
and my sins and past mistakes
were under the blood of Jesus Christ.


670
00:45:22.181 --> 00:45:25.070
I was able to take Lisa
to the graves of my men


671
00:45:25.181 --> 00:45:28.236
and shared with her how
instrumental they'd been


672
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:30.528
in sowing the seeds of the Gospel

673
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.120
before they died.

674
00:45:32.668 --> 00:45:34.785
It was their bold witness

675
00:45:34.888 --> 00:45:37.759
and the unceasing prayers
of my precious wife


676
00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:40.120
that ultimately brought me to Christ.

677
00:45:40.756 --> 00:45:46.081
I'm marveled at God's amazing grace
for such a wretch like me!


678
00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:49.533
And I preached to these men

679
00:45:49.832 --> 00:45:53.951
that they too could find hope
through Jesus Christ.


680
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:59.317
But one night I thought I noticed
a familiar face in the crowd.


681
00:46:00.082 --> 00:46:04.031
Could it be after all these years?

682
00:46:05.001 --> 00:46:07.811
I began to preach
with all of my heart

683
00:46:07.986 --> 00:46:10.090
how God loved each of them,

684
00:46:10.401 --> 00:46:12.284
no matter who they were

685
00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:14.061
or what they had done.

686
00:46:14.362 --> 00:46:17.023
That Jesus stood with the power

687
00:46:17.205 --> 00:46:22.549
and grace to be able to forgive
every single sin no matter how deep,


688
00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:23.959
how dark,

689
00:46:24.108 --> 00:46:26.689
or how depraved the person had become.

690
00:46:30.567 --> 00:46:32.737
By the end of my message,

691
00:46:32.909 --> 00:46:35.246
I locked eyes with that man.

692
00:46:35.851 --> 00:46:40.828
My heart ached for Marco
to come to Christ,


693
00:46:41.729 --> 00:46:44.336
but he had to make this decision himself.

694
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:49.178
[music]

695
00:46:51.596 --> 00:46:54.207
Ol' Marco raised his hand.

696
00:46:54.326 --> 00:46:57.509
The same hand that had sold me drugs,

697
00:46:57.651 --> 00:47:00.326
the same hand that had stolen from people,

698
00:47:00.588 --> 00:47:06.534
the same hand that nearly had me killed
was now reaching out to a loving Saviour!


699
00:47:08.612 --> 00:47:13.784
My old drug dealer came forward
and melted in my warm embrace.


700
00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:17.933
He was broken from the years
of such a hard life.


701
00:47:18.414 --> 00:47:24.702
But he was tired of running from God,
and here he was ready to be saved.


702
00:47:25.353 --> 00:47:29.378
Together,
we knelt at the old-fashioned altar,


703
00:47:29.607 --> 00:47:34.396
and I had the wonderful privilege
of personally leading Marco to Christ.


704
00:47:35.339 --> 00:47:38.224
Tears streamed down both of our faces

705
00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:40.499
as he too found hope,

706
00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:43.402
Redeeming Hope.

707
00:48:04.432 --> 00:48:08.235
-Thank you for taking the time
to watch our film, Redeeming Hope.


708
00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:10.633
I pray that it deeply touched your heart.

709
00:48:11.006 --> 00:48:12.813
While the story is fictitious,

710
00:48:12.926 --> 00:48:15.189
the events and struggles
portrayed in this film


711
00:48:15.308 --> 00:48:18.925
were inspired by true events
and based on real people


712
00:48:19.022 --> 00:48:21.992
who found hope in Jesus Christ.

713
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560
Friend,

714
00:48:23.796 --> 00:48:26.605
just as Denver McCabe
and even Marco realized


715
00:48:26.685 --> 00:48:30.883
that they were lost and in desperate need
of the Lord to save their souls,


716
00:48:31.013 --> 00:48:33.597
wouldn't you also like
to come to him by faith


717
00:48:33.763 --> 00:48:37.030
and accept Him
as your personal Saviour?


718
00:48:37.402 --> 00:48:41.328
God loves you. No matter who you are
or what you've done,


719
00:48:41.455 --> 00:48:43.679
Jesus died on the Cross for you

720
00:48:43.795 --> 00:48:47.910
so that you could have peace
and eternal life with Him in Heaven.


721
00:48:48.263 --> 00:48:50.484
God promises in Romans 10:13,

722
00:48:50.958 --> 00:48:54.230
"For whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord


723
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.745
shall be saved."

724
00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:58.696
You can be saved right now.

725
00:48:59.373 --> 00:49:00.639
In this moment,

726
00:49:00.981 --> 00:49:02.562
you have a choice,

727
00:49:02.666 --> 00:49:04.926
a personal decision to make.

728
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:07.203
Will you accept Jesus?

729
00:49:07.285 --> 00:49:08.843
He's ready to receive you

730
00:49:08.999 --> 00:49:12.175
and God is listening,
ready to forgive you.


731
00:49:12.408 --> 00:49:14.286
Please don't wait any longer.

732
00:49:14.394 --> 00:49:16.095
From your heart in faith,

733
00:49:16.283 --> 00:49:20.094
would you bow your head
and sincerely pray with me?


734
00:49:21.028 --> 00:49:22.705
Dear Lord Jesus,

735
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:24.967
I know that I'm a sinner.

736
00:49:25.938 --> 00:49:29.505
I know I deserve
the penalty for my sins,

737
00:49:30.385 --> 00:49:33.133
but I don't want to
die and go to Hell.

738
00:49:34.492 --> 00:49:37.259
I want to be with You in Heaven.

739
00:49:38.155 --> 00:49:42.154
I believe you died in the cross
and rose again for me.


740
00:49:43.176 --> 00:49:45.441
Please forgive me of my sins.

741
00:49:46.315 --> 00:49:49.047
Come into my heart and save me.

742
00:49:50.043 --> 00:49:53.846
I gladly receive
Your gift of eternal life.


743
00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.742
I trust in You
alone to be my Saviour.

744
00:49:59.884 --> 00:50:03.661
Thank you, God,
for Your love and for saving me.


745
00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:05.676
In Jesus' name,

746
00:50:06.077 --> 00:50:07.460
Amen.

747
00:50:09.334 --> 00:50:10.492
Friend,

748
00:50:10.711 --> 00:50:14.500
did you just trust in Jesus Christ
as your personal Saviour?


749
00:50:14.857 --> 00:50:18.699
The Bible plainly teaches
that you can never lose your salvation.


750
00:50:18.809 --> 00:50:21.476
"For whosoever shall call upon
the name of the Lord


751
00:50:21.596 --> 00:50:23.606
shall be saved."

752
00:50:23.759 --> 00:50:25.529
Not maybe or might be,

753
00:50:25.683 --> 00:50:26.991
but shall be.

754
00:50:27.319 --> 00:50:30.595
John 3:16 declares,
"For God so loved the world


755
00:50:30.745 --> 00:50:32.794
that He gave His only begotten Son,

756
00:50:32.941 --> 00:50:35.700
that whosoever believe in Him
should not perish,


757
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:38.729
but have everlasting life."

758
00:50:39.145 --> 00:50:42.066
You are saved forever!

759
00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:45.902
If you prayed and trusted in Christ today,
we would love to hear from you.


760
00:50:46.053 --> 00:50:48.664
Please contact us
so we can rejoice with you.


761
00:50:48.933 --> 00:50:51.646
We'd be delighted to pray for you
and help you with any questions


762
00:50:51.767 --> 00:50:54.214
that you may have as a Christian.

763
00:50:54.599 --> 00:50:59.620
God bless you! And please share this
wonderful film of redemption . . . of hope -


764
00:50:59.937 --> 00:51:03.083
with as many people
as you possibly can.
