1
00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:18.981
Stand up, guys-

2
00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.588
They are here now.

3
00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:07.841
God gave us hands,
so we have to work.

4
00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:12.907
Since we are here, we have to work.

5
00:13:13.005 --> 00:13:15.281
Everybody works 12 hours.

6
00:13:15.374 --> 00:13:19.413
Some do work that requires
physical strength.


7
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:21.252
Some use their mind.

8
00:13:21.347 --> 00:13:26.387
Some work requires hands and feet,
some work requires brains.


9
00:13:26.485 --> 00:13:31.127
Some people have to use their muscles,
some use their pens.


10
00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:34.401
There are different systems.

11
00:13:34.493 --> 00:13:36.268
Some work on machines.

12
00:13:36.362 --> 00:13:39.935
I do different things.

13
00:13:40.032 --> 00:13:42.410
The machines have to be controlled,

14
00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:46.142
either by using a button or the brain.

15
00:13:46.238 --> 00:13:48.684
If I am supposed to move this,

16
00:13:48.974 --> 00:13:52.478
I need to use my brain
to control the movement.


17
00:13:52.578 --> 00:13:56.549
There, you push a button.
It has a computer system.


18
00:13:56.649 --> 00:13:59.289
But here,
I need to use strength and brains.


19
00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:02.423
Or I would break my hands and legs.

20
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:07.493
This has 220 kilograms of Chemicals.

21
00:14:07.593 --> 00:14:10.574
This has 100 kilograms. 
That one has 60.

22
00:14:10.663 --> 00:14:14.406
Everything has different
systems and weights.


23
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.480
That is how things are made.

24
00:14:16.568 --> 00:14:22.177
The color will be made
according to the order.


25
00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:26.948
Sixty, 50, 40, 35 kilograms.
Whatever is needed.


26
00:14:27.046 --> 00:14:31.256
100, 200, 220,
that's the amount you make in color.


27
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.160
You make it to match the order.

28
00:21:10.382 --> 00:21:13.591
Working on the Wheel
pays 210 rupees per shift.


29
00:21:15.487 --> 00:21:19.731
From that I have to eat,
save and raise my family.


30
00:21:22.094 --> 00:21:26.873
When I think about
having to raise my kids with this money,


31
00:21:26.965 --> 00:21:32.381
I try saving 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 rupees.

32
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:35.384
The mill doesn't run
every day of the month.


33
00:21:35.474 --> 00:21:41.390
Tell me, who has the strength
to work nonstop for 36-48 hours?


34
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:47.590
You have to break and twist your body
to save a paisa or two.


35
00:22:16.648 --> 00:22:19.822
How would the wealthy know
the problems of the poor?


36
00:22:19.918 --> 00:22:23.991
What am I even doing here
when I have everything back home?


37
00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:26.535
But it is poverty

38
00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:31.074
that makes a poor man take loans
to come here to work.


39
00:22:32.197 --> 00:22:37.010
When I don't have the money to come here,
I borrow at ten percent interest.


40
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:39.842
I earn by hard labor, sir.

41
00:22:39.938 --> 00:22:42.145
It's a 12-hour shift here.

42
00:22:43.508 --> 00:22:48.116
You come at 8:00 in the morning
and leave at 8:00 in the evening.


43
00:22:48.213 --> 00:22:52.559
Once back, I cook and eat.

44
00:22:52.651 --> 00:22:58.624
Then after an hour's break,
I come for a second shift at 9:00 p.m.


45
00:23:01.693 --> 00:23:03.604
There are no other options.

46
00:23:03.695 --> 00:23:05.072
But what is poverty anyway?

47
00:23:07.065 --> 00:23:09.102
Poverty is harassment, sir.

48
00:23:09.935 --> 00:23:15.476
One has to forsake one's kids,
wife and parents to come here.


49
00:23:18.076 --> 00:23:20.920
You can't do anything. 
There is no cure.

50
00:23:30.956 --> 00:23:35.701
Sir, let me tell you
that nobody is exploiting me.


51
00:23:35.794 --> 00:23:38.604
I have taken loans
to come here to work.

52
00:23:38.697 --> 00:23:43.271
For my own needs, to raise my kids.

53
00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:49.883
Exploitation would mean
that I am being forced to work here.


54
00:23:49.975 --> 00:23:51.682
Wouldn't it?

55
00:23:51.776 --> 00:23:54.120
I have come from far away.

56
00:23:54.212 --> 00:23:59.161
I have traveled 1,600 kilometers
so I can work here.


57
00:24:00.118 --> 00:24:01.597
Of my own free will.

58
00:24:01.686 --> 00:24:03.188
Nobody is pressuring me.

59
00:24:03.288 --> 00:24:07.930
We all come here in order to work,
as we're in debt.


60
00:24:09.594 --> 00:24:11.232
There are thousands like me.

61
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:17.079
The train I travel in has four carriages,
but there's not an inch of free space.


62
00:24:17.168 --> 00:24:21.639
You can't sit down,
you have to stand for 36 hours.


63
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:28.055
There is neither water nor food.
I carry roasted chickpeas.


64
00:24:28.146 --> 00:24:30.956
For 36 hours there is no food.

65
00:26:53.024 --> 00:26:56.130
The only money
I spend is on chewing tobacco.


66
00:26:56.861 --> 00:26:59.171
What other habit can I truly afford?

67
00:26:59.264 --> 00:27:02.211
I can't even afford a cigarette.

68
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.009
A cigarette is five rupees or ten.
I can't afford it.


69
00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:09.813
A packet of chewing tobacco
is two rupees and lasts all day.


70
00:27:09.908 --> 00:27:13.253
Won't you need a buzz
if you work all day?

71
00:27:13.344 --> 00:27:16.188
Chewing tobacco gives you relief.

72
00:27:16.281 --> 00:27:20.229
Not even the supervisor
or the boss can say anything.


73
00:27:22.053 --> 00:27:24.465
All day you work, so chewing tobacco

74
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:28.069
gives you a moment to sit and breathe.

75
00:29:20.438 --> 00:29:25.114
You have to work
12 hours, no matter what.

76
00:29:26.477 --> 00:29:31.085
You work on and on and on
until the 12 hours are over.


77
00:29:34.419 --> 00:29:38.094
When I arrive at the gate for work,

78
00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:41.602
I feel like turning back right there.

79
00:29:46.364 --> 00:29:49.243
When I arrive at the gate,
my gut tells me...


80
00:29:50.435 --> 00:29:52.642
that I should just turn back.

81
00:29:52.937 --> 00:29:55.383
But it's not good to turn back.

82
00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:19.669
What you learn as a child,
you cannot learn as an adult.


83
00:30:21.232 --> 00:30:25.271
If you pay attention
to the machines when you are young,


84
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.611
you become sharper as an adult.

85
00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.681
You become skilled.

86
00:30:30.975 --> 00:30:34.479
Whatever you learn,
you should learn as a child.


87
00:30:34.579 --> 00:30:38.322
If I learn this now,
then I can do any work later.


88
00:34:56.274 --> 00:35:00.950
Take out 24 bundles,
and then fill it with 24 more bundles.


89
00:35:02.747 --> 00:35:05.853
- You got the ones from below?
- Yes.


90
00:39:20.538 --> 00:39:23.018
<i>You are me queen of me palaces I</i>

91
00:39:23.107 --> 00:39:26.611
<i>I am the king of the streets ♪</i>

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.520

<i>If you leave in anger I</i>

95
00:39:37.822 --> 00:39:42.965
<i>You will hear news of my death ♪</i>

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:48.669

100

<i>You will hear news of my death ♪</i>

101
00:40:58.636 --> 00:41:03.051
This brand... It costs a thousand!

102
00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.177
We can discuss the price.

103
00:41:08.879 --> 00:41:10.722
I like this one. 
How much is it?

104
00:41:14.151 --> 00:41:17.860
This material is good for the summer.

105
00:41:18.756 --> 00:41:20.292
We call it "voile."

106
00:41:21.759 --> 00:41:24.603
They call it “bawared”

107
00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:26.333
It's expensive.

108
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.075
- You mean this one?
- Yes.


109
00:41:28.165 --> 00:41:32.204
You mean it's better
than the one from Korea?


110
00:41:32.303 --> 00:41:34.681
I'm talking about “jacquard”

111
00:41:34.772 --> 00:41:37.616
- It's comfortable to wear.
- Hm ...


112
00:41:37.708 --> 00:41:40.211
This costs 100... 100...

113
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:43.781
I swear, nowadays it's 127 in dollars.

114
00:42:01.332 --> 00:42:03.107
Buzz off!

115
00:42:05.102 --> 00:42:06.877
Pull out the trash.

116
00:42:07.838 --> 00:42:10.717
Pull it out with your hands.

117
00:42:10.808 --> 00:42:12.617
There”s copper in there.

118
00:42:15.346 --> 00:42:18.190
- It's sticky.
- Pull it!


119
00:42:20.184 --> 00:42:23.028
Pull it out!

120
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.124
- Don't put it on me!
- Pull it all out.


121
00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:40.871
- Where did it fall?
- Take hold of it and pull.


122
00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:43.877
Come on!

123
00:42:43.974 --> 00:42:47.114
- It's Sticky. WII it come off?
- Of course it will.


124
00:42:47.211 --> 00:42:50.283
There is a lot for you to take out.
Just wait.


125
00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:52.258
It's falling.

126
00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:36.293
This state, Gujarat...

127
00:43:37.795 --> 00:43:42.369
The state of Gujarat has
fed the stomachs of the poor.


128
00:43:42.466 --> 00:43:45.709
If there's no food, nothing at home,

129
00:43:45.803 --> 00:43:51.082
a child of 10, 15 or 20 years of age comes
and earns up to 6,000 rupees a month.


130
00:43:51.175 --> 00:43:55.385
Even if he's not able to save anything,

131
00:43:55.479 --> 00:43:58.221
he is at least able to feed himself.

132
00:44:00.317 --> 00:44:02.422
In some states,
there's no shortage of labor.


133
00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:07.229
In Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Orissa...

134
00:44:08.759 --> 00:44:10.261
Chhattisgarh.

135
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.467
If men from there
didn't come to Gujarat to work,


136
00:44:14.765 --> 00:44:16.142
not even a fly would land here.

137
00:44:16.233 --> 00:44:17.940
No mill would run.

138
00:44:23.207 --> 00:44:28.247
If the workers unite,
they can get the bosses to yield.


139
00:44:28.345 --> 00:44:31.224
But the laborers are not united.

140
00:44:31.315 --> 00:44:36.993
If they were,
their circumstances wouldn't be so dire.


141
00:44:39.123 --> 00:44:43.868
We'd work for eight hours instead of 12,
get paid for eight and go home.


142
00:44:43.961 --> 00:44:47.135
We could get rights, funds and bonus.

143
00:44:47.231 --> 00:44:50.542
Here you get your wages
and are then supposed to leave.


144
00:44:50.834 --> 00:44:53.405
We get nothing, no funds, bonus, holidays.

145
00:44:54.872 --> 00:44:56.351
Nobody gets anything.

146
00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.820
You do your duty for a month,
get your wages and leave.


147
00:45:02.146 --> 00:45:07.152
If they find any problems,
they slap you and throw you out.


148
00:45:08.352 --> 00:45:10.161
That's the problem here.

149
00:45:10.254 --> 00:45:15.294
If the laborers had any unity,
they wouldn't be going through this.


150
00:45:15.392 --> 00:45:17.565
Today the laborer can become a tiger.

151
00:45:17.861 --> 00:45:21.172
But due to a lack of unity,
the laborer is a sheep.


152
00:45:21.265 --> 00:45:26.476
Why is there no unity? Because then there
would be eight-hour shifts.


153
00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.551
The bosses would have to com ply.

154
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.084
But when the laborers do unite,
the leader is usually killed.


155
00:45:35.012 --> 00:45:36.958
They finish him off.

156
00:45:42.319 --> 00:45:46.961
The moment people form a union, they ask,

157
00:45:47.057 --> 00:45:49.833
Who is the leader?"

158
00:45:49.927 --> 00:45:55.138
Then the bosses get together
and finish the leader off.


159
00:48:37.227 --> 00:48:39.138
Union?

160
00:48:39.229 --> 00:48:40.765
I am the union.

161
00:48:42.232 --> 00:48:44.041
Unions exist,

162
00:48:44.134 --> 00:48:46.410
but they are at a lower level
than the contractor.


163
00:48:46.503 --> 00:48:49.677
If the contractor is useless,
then there'll be a union.


164
00:48:49.773 --> 00:48:54.153
If the contractor is good,
nobody has the strength to make a union.


165
00:48:54.244 --> 00:48:56.155
I am strong.

166
00:48:56.246 --> 00:48:59.625
My laborers don't go anywhere,
so what will a union do?


167
00:49:01.651 --> 00:49:03.653
Nobody can do anything to me.

168
00:49:04.688 --> 00:49:06.531
I can give them two slaps.

169
00:49:08.525 --> 00:49:11.699
If you've been laid off
and the mill is shut down


170
00:49:11.795 --> 00:49:13.570
then what will you do?

171
00:49:13.663 --> 00:49:15.802
Will you go back to Uttar Pradesh?

172
00:49:16.099 --> 00:49:19.808
Will you come back from Uttar Pradesh
to fight for your case?


173
00:49:22.806 --> 00:49:26.083
It's a simple thing, 
I am telling you.

174
00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:29.484
Neither you or I could do it.

175
00:49:31.782 --> 00:49:36.288
I can't come from Uttar Pradesh, spending

176
00:49:36.386 --> 00:49:38.798
To attend one case
will cost you 1,000 rupees.


177
00:49:39.089 --> 00:49:43.469
Once you're here, you'll also have to
spend on food and water.


178
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.369
This is distressful.

179
00:49:45.462 --> 00:49:50.468
Will a person who doesn't
have any food to eat


180
00:49:50.567 --> 00:49:53.810
think about fighting a case
from Uttar Pradesh?


181
00:49:54.638 --> 00:49:56.083
Will he?

182
00:50:22.165 --> 00:50:24.873
That is why the unions are weak.

183
00:50:25.168 --> 00:50:28.479
And why the laborers
can't support the unions.


184
00:50:30.707 --> 00:50:32.880
And what does a contractor do?

185
00:50:33.176 --> 00:50:36.214
He's always there to help the laborer.

186
00:50:38.582 --> 00:50:42.359
If the laborer ever needs money,
he gives it to him.


187
00:50:42.452 --> 00:50:46.366
Be it 50 rupees, 100 or 150,
the contractor gives it to him.


188
00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:51.634
That's why he is successful
and the union <i>is</i> weak.


189
00:51:46.416 --> 00:51:49.192
The pay is very poor,
given the work we do.


190
00:51:49.286 --> 00:51:52.495
For example, if it's the two of us.

191
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:56.594
What can two people do?
Even if we skip two days work in protest.


192
00:51:56.693 --> 00:52:02.769
The company doesn't close
because of two people not coming to work.


193
00:52:02.866 --> 00:52:07.440
One man thinks, 'We should put pressure on
the company and its owner."


194
00:52:07.537 --> 00:52:12.316
The other man thinks,
"No, this is wrong. We'll starve to death.


195
00:52:12.409 --> 00:52:15.754
We have no one here. 
Who will feed us?”

196
00:52:15.845 --> 00:52:20.225
Thus, the workers compromise.
And they just carry on.


197
00:53:01.291 --> 00:53:05.865
Why would I get angry
if I am being paid for the work I do?


198
00:53:07.464 --> 00:53:09.569
You don't just get angry like that.

199
00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:12.545
You get angry if there is a reason.

200
00:53:12.636 --> 00:53:16.641
If someone says something nasty.
It's not as if the boss insults us.


201
00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:21.348
The workers here insult each other
and get angry with each other.


202
00:53:22.646 --> 00:53:26.389
Nobody else says anything to us.
The boss never comes.


203
00:53:26.483 --> 00:53:30.056
I don't even know who the boss is,
what he does.


204
00:53:31.621 --> 00:53:34.033
I don't know anything about the boss.

205
00:53:34.324 --> 00:53:38.830
I know the company's gate.
I am a worker who works here.


206
00:53:38.928 --> 00:53:42.535
I know my section, I know my room.
That's it.


207
00:53:42.632 --> 00:53:46.978
This is all I have. From here to my room
and from my room to here.


208
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:50.882
Neither do I know who the boss is,
nor how he looks.


209
00:53:52.042 --> 00:53:53.885
I don't know anything.

210
01:02:57.486 --> 01:02:59.295
What are you directing here?

211
01:03:06.596 --> 01:03:09.440
Because of the drought,
nothing is growing.


212
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:15.012
We are farmers.
This time our crops failed completely.


213
01:03:15.104 --> 01:03:20.019
Then we planted potatoes. We planted
potatoes for 20 rupees per kilo.


214
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:21.986
We sold it for five rupees per kilo.

215
01:03:22.078 --> 01:03:24.888
So how much loss did the peasant suffer?

216
01:03:25.648 --> 01:03:28.026
He lost 15 rupees per kilo.

217
01:03:28.117 --> 01:03:32.532
What will he do with that money?
Spend it on his kids' education?


218
01:03:32.622 --> 01:03:37.196
Or spend it on farming?
How will he be able to get grain?


219
01:03:41.197 --> 01:03:44.667
If 15 rupees are gone
and only five rupees are left,


220
01:03:44.967 --> 01:03:49.211
he has to feed his family
from the remaining five rupees.


221
01:03:49.305 --> 01:03:53.583
You also have to pay
for your Children's education.


222
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.547
Otherwise, the kids run away.

223
01:03:56.646 --> 01:04:00.116
That's why you have
to work in a factory.

224
01:04:00.216 --> 01:04:02.287
You have to find another place.

225
01:04:09.525 --> 01:04:13.166
Nobody does any research about this.

226
01:04:13.262 --> 01:04:18.712
People just come here,
look at our problems and leave.


227
01:04:19.001 --> 01:04:21.140
Nobody is ready to take any action.

228
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.453
You are asking us about our problems.

229
01:04:27.543 --> 01:04:33.323
When we are presenting them to you,
why don't you do something about it?


230
01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:36.329
Get our shifts reduced to eight hours!

231
01:04:36.419 --> 01:04:39.195
Turn 12 hours into eight-hour shifts.

232
01:04:39.288 --> 01:04:44.169
If you have the capacity, then do it.
All the workers will agree.


233
01:04:44.994 --> 01:04:46.667
They will all agree.

234
01:04:47.563 --> 01:04:51.375
We will follow you wherever you take us.
We'll skip work.


235
01:04:51.467 --> 01:04:54.311
- Right, guys? Will you come?
- Yes!


236
01:04:54.403 --> 01:04:59.375
What do you say?
Why have you come here? Tell us honestly.


237
01:05:01.043 --> 01:05:05.150
You will leave after listening to us,
just as the ministers do.


238
01:05:05.247 --> 01:05:10.094
They come here,
deliver their speeches and leave.


239
01:05:10.186 --> 01:05:14.225
For us workers,
it's the same story on and on again.


240
01:05:20.596 --> 01:05:25.545
If you really want to do something
for the workers,


241
01:05:26.469 --> 01:05:28.642
then tell us what to do.

242
01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.671
My only satisfaction is
that everyone dies.


243
01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:36.765
Nobody takes anything with them.

244
01:07:36.866 --> 01:07:42.748
Even when the rich go,
they leave the world with nothing.
