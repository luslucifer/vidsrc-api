WINNER OF THE GRAND PRIZE
OF THE CITY OF VENICE 1961

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.750
LEON MORIN
PRIEST


4
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.897
It must've been around 8 in the evening.

5
00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:25.997
I was coming back from a neighbouring village

6
00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:28.446
when I saw a group of
strange young men in the park,


7
00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:30.148
staring at the passers-by.

8
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.447
They were wearing funny little felt hats
topped with a tall feather.


9
00:03:35.113 --> 00:03:37.574
I would've taken them for street actors...

10
00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:40.188
had it not been
for the stack of guns.

11
00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:54.013
Our town was occupied by Italian soldiers.

12
00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:46.247
The weight of that occupation
seemed light to me.


13
00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:55.130
Censorship alone reminded me
of the rigours of a war grown distant.


14
00:04:57.113 --> 00:05:02.197
I worked at a correspondence school
correcting French schoolwork.


15
00:05:20.947 --> 00:05:23.197
Mr Edelman was an old philosophy teacher

16
00:05:23.363 --> 00:05:26.863
who, like myself, had been stranded
at the school by the hazards of war.


17
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.655
I liked Sabine Levy,
the director's personal assistant.


18
00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:43.780
The sight of her
sent me ﬂying through time and space.


19
00:05:45.947 --> 00:05:49.447
I thought that authority
must belong to beautiful beings.


20
00:05:52.905 --> 00:05:55.131
I felt an intense pleasure...

21
00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:59.047
when my gaze sparred with hers,

22
00:06:05.513 --> 00:06:08.066
until, unable to take it any longer,

23
00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.588
I was forced to lower my eyes,

24
00:06:11.222 --> 00:06:13.238
savouring her victory.

25
00:06:18.622 --> 00:06:19.872
You see,

26
00:06:21.388 --> 00:06:23.988
she reminds me of
the beautiful youths in scripture,


27
00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:27.013
the saints,

28
00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.597
wielding the traveller's staff,

29
00:06:30.763 --> 00:06:34.197
the fiery sword or the rod,
and who are angels.


30
00:06:36.138 --> 00:06:39.805
She looks like an Amazon, like Pallas,

31
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.413
like a samurai.

32
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.638
When she leans over me as I work,

33
00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.805
I feel like I'm in the shade
of a palm tree.


34
00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:54.722
In short, you want to sleep with her.

35
00:06:54.888 --> 00:06:56.692
Are you mad? How dreadful!

36
00:06:57.555 --> 00:06:59.110
If Sabine fascinates me,

37
00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:01.822
it's because she looks like a young man,

38
00:07:03.097 --> 00:07:05.472
but blessed with a singular charm,

39
00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:10.138
a subtle, feminine virility.

40
00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:25.472
Everything about her charmed me.

41
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.013
The diversity of her intelligence,
her strange beauty.


42
00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:46.972
I felt attached to her
by a bond stronger than that of mating.


43
00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.930
The papers are saying
the Germans will occupy the town.


44
00:07:55.097 --> 00:07:58.430
We'll make eyes at them
so they don't shoot us.


45
00:07:58.597 --> 00:08:00.305
I'd rather be shot
than make eyes at them.


46
00:10:05.222 --> 00:10:06.972
They'll be late baptisms, that's all.

47
00:10:07.138 --> 00:10:11.138
Lucienne, Jenny and I decided
to baptise our children,


48
00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:14.638
who were half-Jewish
or wholly of Communist descent.


49
00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:17.180
Once we have the baptism certificates,
we'll just doctor the dates.


50
00:10:17.347 --> 00:10:19.013
What about the godparents?

51
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.388
Yes, of course. 
That's more involved.

52
00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:24.305
I've thought about it,
and this is my suggestion.


53
00:10:24.847 --> 00:10:28.472
I'll be godmother to France,
your daughter.


54
00:10:28.638 --> 00:10:33.430
You, Barny, will be godmother to my
daughter Jaqueline and to Jenny's son.


55
00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:36.805
Emile, Jenny's husband,
will be godfather to my daughter


56
00:10:36.972 --> 00:10:39.847
and to your daughter, France.

57
00:10:40.013 --> 00:10:43.055
You, Barny, Jenny...

58
00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:47.680
No, sorry.
I'll be godmother to Jenny's daughter.


59
00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:50.180
Your children will just have
to do without a godfather.


60
00:10:50.347 --> 00:10:53.430
Let's write this down
so we keep it straight.


61
00:10:54.263 --> 00:10:55.347
All right...

62
00:11:21.638 --> 00:11:23.347
- Hello, Barny.
- Hello.


63
00:11:23.513 --> 00:11:25.472
- It's hot!
- Be quiet.


64
00:11:28.138 --> 00:11:29.555
It's too hot!

65
00:11:29.763 --> 00:11:32.013
Be quiet or I'll call the fur salesman!

66
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.722
Help me, Barny. 
Polish her shoes.

67
00:11:41.138 --> 00:11:43.097
There isn't a brush? 
How about a cloth?

68
00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:45.763
Never mind, take the curtain.

69
00:11:48.388 --> 00:11:52.305
We shouldn't make the priest wait.
Pierre is already there with Emile.


70
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.222
Your slip!
Turn around, for heaven's sake!


71
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.013
Stop it!

72
00:12:15.013 --> 00:12:17.347
You really should avoid
smashing your head in.


73
00:12:17.513 --> 00:12:19.972
May as well wait
until afterwards at least.


74
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:30.513
Receive the salt of wisdom.
May it be a pledge of everlasting life.


75
00:12:31.222 --> 00:12:33.805
- It's bad.
- That's war for you, mate.


76
00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:35.972
May peace be with you.

77
00:12:40.263 --> 00:12:42.180
Are you sure he won't ring the bells?

78
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.305
Emerging from the dark church
into the light


79
00:12:49.472 --> 00:12:53.138
were four children baptised
by the grace of God and the Germans.


80
00:12:57.055 --> 00:13:00.305
The members of the Resistance
embraced their wives and children


81
00:13:03.722 --> 00:13:06.013
and then went back into the woods.

82
00:13:40.555 --> 00:13:43.305
I see the believers and their priest
as a challenge.


83
00:13:43.513 --> 00:13:45.597
They live off paper money.

84
00:13:46.472 --> 00:13:49.555
I'm going to tell them what I think.
Know what I'm going to do?


85
00:13:52.722 --> 00:13:55.763
I set my sights
on the church of Saint-Bernard.


86
00:14:08.463 --> 00:14:10.147
PRIEST CONFESSION TUESDAY,
THURSDAY TO SATURDAY - BEFORE MASS


87
00:14:10.488 --> 00:14:12.990
I ruled out the priest
likely to be the oldest


88
00:14:13.097 --> 00:14:15.347
and most impervious to kidding around.

89
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.513
That left the two curates,

90
00:14:35.914 --> 00:14:37.779
- ABBOT CONFESSION MONDAY,
- Philippe De Manoir...


91
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.730
THURSDAY TO SATURDAY 
- BEFORE MASS

92
00:14:51.805 --> 00:14:54.422
...and Léon Morin.

93
00:14:54.888 --> 00:14:59.180
I had to guess who would be more receptive
based on their names alone.


94
00:14:59.347 --> 00:15:01.613
Philippe must come from
a bourgeois family.


95
00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:05.332
Considering the name they gave him,
Leon's parents must be peasants.


96
00:15:05.432 --> 00:15:07.641
Léon it was.
Down with Morin!


97
00:15:08.513 --> 00:15:09.781
I was afraid,

98
00:15:10.082 --> 00:15:12.088
but turning back was not an option.

99
00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:18.722
Morin was supposed to be there
at 5:30pm.


100
00:16:17.597 --> 00:16:20.930
- Religion is the opium of the people.
- Not exactly.


101
00:16:21.972 --> 00:16:25.347
It's the bourgeois
who distorted it to their own benefit.


102
00:16:25.513 --> 00:16:29.930
But you allowed them do it.
You're one and the same now.


103
00:16:30.638 --> 00:16:35.013
The Church has lost the working class,
it's true. But we're reacting.


104
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:40.013
Taking communion will strengthen the
resolve of a righteous man on strike.


105
00:16:40.847 --> 00:16:43.347
The Christian heart loathes injustice.

106
00:16:43.513 --> 00:16:45.138
That's not all.

107
00:16:45.847 --> 00:16:50.722
Even if religion had remained pure,
that wouldn't prove its truth to me.


108
00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:54.055
Of course. It's good that you came.

109
00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:57.347
How's that? I came here as an enemy.

110
00:16:57.513 --> 00:16:59.305
I don't believe that.

111
00:17:00.805 --> 00:17:02.388
It's been a long time
since you've been to confession.


112
00:17:02.597 --> 00:17:05.722
Not since my First Communion,
but I'm not here to confess.


113
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.805
I know it's not fun to acknowledge
your faults in front of others.


114
00:17:10.013 --> 00:17:13.305
Fun or not, it doesn't matter
because I don't believe in God.


115
00:17:13.472 --> 00:17:16.180
Are you sure? Do you ever pray?

116
00:17:16.347 --> 00:17:18.888
Only when I can't help it.

117
00:17:19.055 --> 00:17:22.430
A leftover habit from my childhood,
a weakness.


118
00:17:22.597 --> 00:17:25.747
- You're proud, aren't you?
- Yes.


119
00:17:25.913 --> 00:17:27.997
Do you sometimes lie?

120
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.180
Yes.

121
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.513
- Have you ever stolen anything?
- Yes.


122
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.263
- What did you steal?
- Food.


123
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.805
- Do you ever get angry?
- Yes.


124
00:17:38.972 --> 00:17:42.888
- Do you sin against purity?
- I don't know.


125
00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:47.388
- Do you make sacrifices for others?
- Only for my daughter.


126
00:17:47.555 --> 00:17:50.847
- Do you serve your duty of state?
- More or less.


127
00:17:51.013 --> 00:17:55.388
- Are you realising your full potential?
- No.


128
00:17:56.847 --> 00:17:59.763
Saint Paul said,
"The world would be better if you were."


129
00:18:02.597 --> 00:18:06.680
That was a good confession.
Now ask for forgiveness.


130
00:18:06.847 --> 00:18:08.638
- Ask whom?
- Ask...


131
00:18:10.472 --> 00:18:11.638
Ask X.

132
00:18:16.055 --> 00:18:19.722
We'll stay like this
until the end of the world.


133
00:18:19.888 --> 00:18:21.555
You lack courage.

134
00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:24.097
Forgive me.

135
00:18:25.722 --> 00:18:27.722
- Do you want me to give you penitence?
- No.


136
00:18:27.888 --> 00:18:31.055
Yes. A penitence would be good for you.

137
00:18:31.222 --> 00:18:33.805
After you leave the confessional,
go and kneel.


138
00:18:34.472 --> 00:18:36.222
On one of the velvet chairs?

139
00:18:36.388 --> 00:18:39.305
No, on the flagstones.

140
00:18:39.472 --> 00:18:43.680
They'll hurt your knees a little.
There, say a prayer of your choosing.


141
00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:48.263
That pseudo-prayer could only be
a mockery since I'm not a believer.


142
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.680
Prayers are always a mockery.

143
00:18:50.847 --> 00:18:54.388
The disproportion between them
and the Almighty is vast.


144
00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:57.930
But what if the person saying them
takes them seriously, believes in them?


145
00:18:58.097 --> 00:19:01.430
Who told you that the effort
is less worthy than the faith?


146
00:19:01.597 --> 00:19:04.305
- I feel no remorse.
- I should hope not.


147
00:19:04.472 --> 00:19:07.972
Judas felt remorse,
that's why he hanged himself.


148
00:19:08.138 --> 00:19:11.430
It is repentance that is asked of us,
just the opposite of remorse.


149
00:19:11.638 --> 00:19:13.430
I could repent

150
00:19:13.597 --> 00:19:16.847
if I had chosen Christianity
as my line of moral conduct.


151
00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:22.263
Even so,
you live in a Christianised world.


152
00:19:22.972 --> 00:19:26.597
Are you always pleased with yourself
when you sin


153
00:19:26.763 --> 00:19:28.722
against the collective conscience?

154
00:19:28.888 --> 00:19:29.888
No.

155
00:19:30.888 --> 00:19:35.722
My behaviour is determined
by heredity, agencies, circumstances.


156
00:19:35.888 --> 00:19:39.888
You're a robot, then? Lower your head
so I can give you absolution.


157
00:19:42.263 --> 00:19:44.513
It's easy to get me to play along,
isn't it?


158
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.847
Relatively.

159
00:20:05.222 --> 00:20:06.222
I...

160
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.347
absolve you of your sins.

161
00:20:10.222 --> 00:20:14.388
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.


162
00:20:16.513 --> 00:20:19.972
May the passion of Jesus Christ,
our Lord,


163
00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:26.472
the merits of the blessed Virgin Mary
and of all the saints,


164
00:20:28.555 --> 00:20:30.888
everything good you have done,

165
00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:35.222
and everything you have had to suffer,
aid you in the remittance of your sins,


166
00:20:35.847 --> 00:20:39.013
the acquisition of grace,
and the conquest of everlasting life.


167
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.388
Amen.

168
00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:46.013
- Shall I lend you some books?
- Yes.


169
00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:51.055
The presbytery is opposite the cinema.
When can you come?


170
00:20:51.222 --> 00:20:52.680
Only in the evenings.

171
00:20:54.638 --> 00:20:57.763
Can you come Wednesday at 20:30?
Third floor.


172
00:20:59.013 --> 00:21:02.555
Father Morin. You won't forget?

173
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.180
You may go now.

174
00:21:40.847 --> 00:21:44.513
I remembered the pain
that had been inflicted on me.


175
00:22:13.597 --> 00:22:18.930
I walked happily,
light, precious, fragile.


176
00:22:20.055 --> 00:22:22.305
I didn't know
if I should attribute my joy


177
00:22:22.472 --> 00:22:27.097
to the complete freedom of my thoughts
or to the absolution I'd been given.


178
00:22:28.972 --> 00:22:33.347
Wednesday night I walked through town,
paused in front of shop windows,


179
00:22:34.597 --> 00:22:37.263
took shortcuts, made detours,

180
00:22:38.597 --> 00:22:40.555
and reached, at the agreed time,

181
00:22:41.347 --> 00:22:45.472
the alley that separated
the church from the presbytery.


182
00:22:53.088 --> 00:22:54.888
NIGHT BELL FOR SACRAMENTS

183
00:23:55.555 --> 00:23:56.763
Hello.

184
00:23:57.347 --> 00:23:58.347
Hello.

185
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.430
How have you been since the other day?

186
00:24:39.138 --> 00:24:43.513
- Were the streets of St-Bernard kind?
- Yes... No.


187
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.763
Anyhow, I'll never enter a church again,
except as a tourist.


188
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.763
- We're all tourists in a way.
- It's not the same.


189
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.430
Some people aren't scandalised
by gilding.


190
00:24:52.597 --> 00:24:56.347
It scandalises me as much as it does
you. All that junk should be burned.


191
00:24:56.555 --> 00:24:58.930
- You're a priest and you say that?
- Yes.


192
00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:01.388
You think priests
like religious trinkets?


193
00:25:01.555 --> 00:25:04.597
- They allow them to exist.
- Not all of them.


194
00:25:04.763 --> 00:25:08.180
We fight. It's hard,
but there is already a bit of progress.


195
00:25:08.347 --> 00:25:11.263
For example, there is no longer
a class system for our burials.


196
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.763
Sometimes it would take three priests
to put a man in the ground. For what?


197
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.013
Burial is not a sacrament.
It's secondary.


198
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.680
We're not undertakers,
we're here for the living.


199
00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:27.888
If that's your accomplishment, reducing
the number of priests at a burial...


200
00:25:28.055 --> 00:25:32.930
We also did away with collection. It's
always a question of money in church,


201
00:25:33.097 --> 00:25:35.847
so the people who don't have any
don't come.


202
00:25:36.013 --> 00:25:39.763
Yes, but that has to do with the
non-application of Christ's teachings.


203
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.180
Question number one is,
"Are Christ's teachings viable?"


204
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.888
What is your idea of Christ?

205
00:25:46.055 --> 00:25:49.180
I read the Gospels, of course,
and Renan.


206
00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:51.972
- That's all?
- And...


207
00:25:52.138 --> 00:25:54.597
Oh, yes, Life of Christ
by Giovanni Papini.


208
00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:57.638
Papini isn't terribly good.

209
00:26:08.555 --> 00:26:10.763
Jesus Christus by Karl Adam.

210
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.555
Professor at the University of Tübingen,
no less.


211
00:26:15.263 --> 00:26:19.430
Take this book.
Can you come back Friday evening?


212
00:26:19.638 --> 00:26:22.222
The day after tomorrow?
But I won't finish it by then.


213
00:26:22.388 --> 00:26:24.888
We should see each other regardless.

214
00:26:25.055 --> 00:26:29.972
- Do you want to convert me?
- Only you and the Lord can do that.


215
00:26:31.597 --> 00:26:33.013
Then why are you lending me books?

216
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.763
Wouldn't you, in my position?

217
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.680
I don't know.
But why do you want me to come back?


218
00:26:39.847 --> 00:26:44.805
You never feel the need to exchange
ideas with your peers? You brute!


219
00:26:49.222 --> 00:26:51.138
That was mostly on Monday.

220
00:26:51.305 --> 00:26:53.930
I don't know what got into me.
Please forget about it.


221
00:26:54.097 --> 00:26:56.388
No, no. It was rather amusing.

222
00:27:04.888 --> 00:27:06.430
See you Friday.

223
00:27:10.805 --> 00:27:13.638
He has the nature
and manners of a militant.


224
00:27:13.805 --> 00:27:16.180
Citizen-priest, comrade-abbot.

225
00:27:17.138 --> 00:27:20.097
He must be acting that way
to confuse me.


226
00:27:46.763 --> 00:27:48.222
- Finished already?
- Yes.


227
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.888
- You read it much too quickly.
- Once I started, I couldn't stop.


228
00:27:59.722 --> 00:28:04.638
From your Catholic perspective, am I
damned if I go on living as an atheist?


229
00:28:04.805 --> 00:28:08.722
No, my child, you're not damned.
Even if you go on living as an atheist.


230
00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:11.472
No salvation outside the Church,
though, right?


231
00:28:11.638 --> 00:28:16.555
That's the invisible Church.
It surpasses the visible one by far.


232
00:28:16.722 --> 00:28:19.055
- What's the invisible Church?
- It's...


233
00:28:20.763 --> 00:28:22.722
the humanity of goodwill.

234
00:28:25.347 --> 00:28:28.472
What a mess.
I never have the time to organise them.


235
00:28:28.638 --> 00:28:30.263
People don't return books.

236
00:28:35.472 --> 00:28:38.305
It's funny that I chanced upon you,
isn't it?


237
00:28:38.472 --> 00:28:39.888
It's providence.

238
00:28:40.597 --> 00:28:43.138
I don't know
why I'm the one choosing your books.


239
00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:46.597
Come over here.
Just take the ones you fancy.


240
00:28:58.347 --> 00:28:59.430
Take it.

241
00:29:03.888 --> 00:29:04.972
Let's see it.

242
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:17.472
I'm not sure I'm doing you a favour
by lending you a book like that.


243
00:29:17.638 --> 00:29:19.680
You're already enough
of a hair-splitter.


244
00:29:19.847 --> 00:29:22.638
But if that's what you want...

245
00:29:24.263 --> 00:29:27.305
- That's all you're taking?
- I have very little time.


246
00:29:27.472 --> 00:29:29.763
You haven't told me
what you thought of Karl Adam.


247
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.972
It's strong, it's original. I think I
believed in God while I was reading it.


248
00:29:35.138 --> 00:29:37.513
It's a good thing that didn't last!

249
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.763
How can you expect me to believe
without proof?


250
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.722
It doesn't matter whether there's proof
as you understand it.


251
00:29:42.888 --> 00:29:45.013
Belief in God
is not a cerebral certainty,


252
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.180
a science, as you seem to think.

253
00:29:48.347 --> 00:29:52.013
Belief in God is the consent
of every part of our being.


254
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.388
When you love someone,
you love that person without proof.


255
00:29:55.555 --> 00:29:58.972
Faith is the same.
It's a moral certainty.


256
00:29:59.138 --> 00:30:00.263
But...

257
00:30:00.972 --> 00:30:03.138
Firstly,
there are loads of religious books


258
00:30:03.305 --> 00:30:05.888
offering would-be proof
of God's existence.


259
00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:10.638
No, they're merely guides
that help us along part of the path.


260
00:30:10.805 --> 00:30:13.555
There is always a precipice
one must cross alone.


261
00:30:13.722 --> 00:30:17.430
If there was proof, as you say,
everyone would believe.


262
00:30:17.597 --> 00:30:20.055
Belief itself would be unnecessary.

263
00:30:20.222 --> 00:30:24.013
We'd understand.
We'd know. We'd see.


264
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.972
It would no longer be down here,
it would be Heaven.


265
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.263
I'm going to do a portrait of you.

266
00:30:39.097 --> 00:30:40.180
That's you.

267
00:30:41.888 --> 00:30:43.430
Now I'll draw God.

268
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:53.847
The dot wants to contain the circle.
It's impossible, as you can see.


269
00:30:54.055 --> 00:30:56.888
The dot's place is inside the circle.

270
00:30:57.055 --> 00:31:00.638
- You can't reverse the roles.
- What is the circle waiting for?


271
00:31:00.805 --> 00:31:02.680
It's up to you to move around.

272
00:31:02.847 --> 00:31:06.347
If God forced devotion upon us,
we wouldn't be free.


273
00:31:06.513 --> 00:31:11.263
The comparison you made just now
between God and love,


274
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.555
it doesn't work at all.

275
00:31:13.722 --> 00:31:15.722
You love another person
without proof, yes.


276
00:31:15.888 --> 00:31:19.805
But it's thanks to proof
that you know that person exists.


277
00:31:19.972 --> 00:31:24.388
In short, you keep wondering
whether God exists or not.


278
00:31:24.555 --> 00:31:28.430
God does not exist;
he is existence itself.


279
00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:33.763
You know, Jehovah said,
"I am he who is."


280
00:31:35.805 --> 00:31:38.472
It's kind of like saying, "X equals X."

281
00:31:40.638 --> 00:31:44.513
After reading Jesus Christus,
I wondered


282
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.930
if God's existence
was a personal existence.


283
00:31:50.513 --> 00:31:53.388
You think that humans
have a personality?


284
00:31:53.555 --> 00:31:54.555
Yes.

285
00:31:55.347 --> 00:31:59.430
Surely that personality
comes from a superior personality?


286
00:31:59.597 --> 00:32:00.847
Not necessarily.

287
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:07.680
We could have progressed
from earlier, undifferentiated beings.


288
00:32:08.638 --> 00:32:11.055
Where would the force
of that progress have come from?


289
00:32:11.222 --> 00:32:13.680
Can a lesser being engender
a greater being on its own?


290
00:32:13.847 --> 00:32:16.472
That's all scholastic.

291
00:32:16.638 --> 00:32:20.097
Perhaps it's good that the lesser being
can engender the greater.


292
00:32:20.263 --> 00:32:22.513
It's as though you believed
in spontaneous generation.


293
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:28.888
Of course. You're giving me all these
reasons to make me believe in God,


294
00:32:30.347 --> 00:32:35.138
but an atheist would have opposing
arguments that were just as strong.


295
00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:39.055
Certainly.
We should stop chattering on like this.


296
00:32:39.222 --> 00:32:41.430
What good are words?

297
00:32:41.597 --> 00:32:45.222
God is, above all else, an experimental,

298
00:32:45.388 --> 00:32:48.055
individual reality, one that
is different for every one of us,


299
00:32:48.222 --> 00:32:50.722
and is incommunicable.

300
00:32:54.638 --> 00:32:56.222
Incommunicable.

301
00:32:58.263 --> 00:33:00.888
- That's dreadful.
- Why?


302
00:33:01.055 --> 00:33:03.638
What difference does it make to you
if there is a God or not?


303
00:33:03.805 --> 00:33:09.597
What do you mean, "What difference
does it make?" That's all that matters.


304
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.680
I wanted to kill myself
in philosophy class because of him.


305
00:33:12.847 --> 00:33:13.888
What an idea!

306
00:33:16.055 --> 00:33:20.555
The conversations with Morin
one or more nights a week


307
00:33:20.722 --> 00:33:22.638
were now part of my life.

308
00:33:25.097 --> 00:33:28.472
I felt at home,
as I never had anywhere before,


309
00:33:28.638 --> 00:33:32.888
in that parlour with its air
of a disused laundry room,


310
00:33:33.055 --> 00:33:35.305
and a floor that shone like a mirror.

311
00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:19.888
The Italians fought all night.

312
00:34:20.055 --> 00:34:23.222
They refused to submit
to German commands.


313
00:34:23.388 --> 00:34:26.472
They didn't surrender
until they'd exhausted their munitions.


314
00:34:28.597 --> 00:34:32.805
We won't be seeing
the feathered street artists any more.


315
00:34:35.055 --> 00:34:39.888
When the Germans occupy a place,
they carry out dramatic disinfections.


316
00:34:40.055 --> 00:34:41.972
It's as though they wanted to prove

317
00:34:42.138 --> 00:34:46.805
that they're different
from their allies.


318
00:34:55.972 --> 00:34:57.847
The deportations began.

319
00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:22.763
I was summoned to the Kommandatur
this morning because of my name.


320
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.097
Holdenberg. I'm Alsatian.

321
00:35:26.263 --> 00:35:29.430
They asked me if I was Jewish,
and I assured them I wasn't.


322
00:35:29.597 --> 00:35:32.430
But how do you really know
if you're Jewish or not?


323
00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:34.222
It's when you're not baptised.

324
00:35:34.388 --> 00:35:35.805
Protestants aren't baptised either.

325
00:35:35.972 --> 00:35:38.347
Of course they are!
Protestants receive baptism.


326
00:35:38.513 --> 00:35:41.930
Jews don't have a nationality.
They're not part of the French race.


327
00:35:42.138 --> 00:35:45.347
- There is no French race.
- Damn! What more do you need?


328
00:35:45.513 --> 00:35:49.680
With all our inventors, our scholars.
When France speaks, the world listens.


329
00:36:29.388 --> 00:36:30.888
That evening,

330
00:36:31.472 --> 00:36:36.388
I stayed behind at the office alone
to correct some exercises.


331
00:36:44.847 --> 00:36:48.097
The offices are closed, sir.
If you'd like to see the director...


332
00:36:48.263 --> 00:36:51.722
No, my dear colleague,
I came to see you.


333
00:36:52.805 --> 00:36:56.888
I just came to say goodbye.
I'm leaving.


334
00:36:59.055 --> 00:37:00.472
You're Mr Edelman.

335
00:37:00.638 --> 00:37:03.597
Edelman? I don't know him any more.

336
00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:09.013
No, Edelman has become Georges Mouchon.

337
00:37:10.263 --> 00:37:14.472
The grey, once sad eyes
of the old philosophy professor


338
00:37:14.638 --> 00:37:17.347
now gleamed with the fever of adventure.

339
00:37:19.055 --> 00:37:22.638
There were more and more roundups,
so Sabine hid nearby,


340
00:37:22.805 --> 00:37:26.805
but came back occasionally
to answer our questions.


341
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.138
My passion had waned.

342
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.722
I told myself that Sabine's fear

343
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.430
was justified, touching even.

344
00:37:44.138 --> 00:37:46.888
But I could love her only
by defying death and torment.


345
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.430
Go home.

346
00:37:49.805 --> 00:37:51.888
Curfew begins in 15 minutes.

347
00:37:52.513 --> 00:37:53.847
Go home.

348
00:37:54.013 --> 00:37:55.097
Go home.

349
00:37:55.638 --> 00:37:58.888
We have to go home
so they can bury the bodies.


350
00:38:00.347 --> 00:38:03.805
As always, the day after
these discreet burials...


351
00:38:03.972 --> 00:38:07.722
This morning I heard
the Germans were shooting hostages.


352
00:38:07.888 --> 00:38:10.763
Fifteen for an officer,
ten for a soldier.


353
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:12.847
Good riddance to them.

354
00:38:13.013 --> 00:38:15.888
They're all Communists and Jews.

355
00:38:16.055 --> 00:38:19.472
By the way, sir,
with your permission...


356
00:38:28.013 --> 00:38:31.805
I never answer the doorbell.
It could be the Gestapo.


357
00:38:31.972 --> 00:38:35.097
It could also be someone
who needs you.


358
00:38:35.263 --> 00:38:38.180
- Should I answer, then?
- Of course.


359
00:38:38.888 --> 00:38:42.347
It's strange how little trust
you have in God.


360
00:39:08.472 --> 00:39:10.555
Anton, Mina, what is it?

361
00:39:13.638 --> 00:39:15.138
This afternoon,

362
00:39:15.972 --> 00:39:17.930
we weren't at home.

363
00:39:18.097 --> 00:39:20.013
The Gestapo came to arrest us.

364
00:39:21.013 --> 00:39:22.097
What will you do?

365
00:39:22.305 --> 00:39:24.513
Nothing, Barny.
We'll leave.


366
00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.888
No, Mina,
that's not what I meant.


367
00:39:27.555 --> 00:39:29.638
You'll sleep here tonight.

368
00:39:29.805 --> 00:39:31.347
What about you, Barny?

369
00:39:31.972 --> 00:39:34.972
I'll make up a bed in the kitchen.

370
00:39:35.347 --> 00:39:36.888
But I've nothing for you to eat.

371
00:39:37.097 --> 00:39:39.513
We brought what we needed
for tonight.


372
00:39:40.138 --> 00:39:42.013
I don't know what we'll do tomorrow.

373
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:46.263
Yes, the ration coupons
are being distributed.


374
00:39:46.722 --> 00:39:50.638
We're illegal now
because we didn't apply


375
00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:52.555
for a visa.

376
00:39:53.347 --> 00:39:58.430
For fear of deportation,
we've lost the right to our ration book.


377
00:39:58.597 --> 00:40:00.555
We can't do without it.

378
00:40:01.472 --> 00:40:04.013
There may be a way...

379
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.263
If you do exactly as I ask,

380
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.597
you should be able to get our coupons.

381
00:40:09.805 --> 00:40:12.055
Tell me what to
do and I'll do it.

382
00:40:12.263 --> 00:40:13.388
Right.

383
00:40:13.555 --> 00:40:14.930
Tomorrow, go...

384
00:40:29.388 --> 00:40:32.138
I would never know
why they had to flee.


385
00:40:32.305 --> 00:40:35.222
But it gave me the courage I needed.

386
00:41:35.972 --> 00:41:37.013
Thank you.

387
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.722
If this continues,
I'll start believing in God.


388
00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.305
I never stopped believing.

389
00:42:08.138 --> 00:42:10.472
That's surprising in a Communist.

390
00:42:10.638 --> 00:42:13.263
Yes, I know, but there's a war on.

391
00:42:27.388 --> 00:42:28.930
Here, type this.

392
00:42:34.138 --> 00:42:37.472
So, apparently you're hiding people.

393
00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:40.138
What? I'm not that stupid.

394
00:42:40.305 --> 00:42:42.430
Life's hard enough as it is.

395
00:42:44.888 --> 00:42:47.513
My concierge, hearing voices,

396
00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.805
must have told Christine's mother,
also a concierge.


397
00:42:52.763 --> 00:42:55.180
Lucienne,
your husband's in the Resistance.


398
00:42:55.347 --> 00:42:56.930
You've got room here.

399
00:42:57.097 --> 00:42:58.763
Please let them hide here.

400
00:42:58.972 --> 00:43:01.472
To hell with them!
You can tell them that.


401
00:43:01.638 --> 00:43:03.722
I'm not getting arrested for them!

402
00:43:03.888 --> 00:43:05.763
I've got enough trouble with Pierre.

403
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.305
If anything happens to him,

404
00:43:07.472 --> 00:43:10.472
how am I going to bring up
my kid on my own?


405
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.055
I can't keep them.
We've been spotted.


406
00:43:13.222 --> 00:43:16.680
Their place is here.
You're safe in the country.


407
00:43:16.888 --> 00:43:18.805
Maybe so, but they're a pain.

408
00:43:18.972 --> 00:43:20.138
They should go home.

409
00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:21.472
They'd be arrested.

410
00:43:22.013 --> 00:43:23.513
What do I care?

411
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.930
Serve them right.

412
00:43:25.097 --> 00:43:26.847
They should've stayed in Russia
or Poland.


413
00:43:27.013 --> 00:43:31.180
I swear on my husband's grave
and my daughter's life,


414
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:32.930
if you don't take them,

415
00:43:33.805 --> 00:43:35.805
I'll report you to the tribunal
I belong to.


416
00:43:39.138 --> 00:43:40.847
Where did you see that, Barny?

417
00:43:41.805 --> 00:43:42.805
At the cinema?

418
00:43:43.305 --> 00:43:44.305
Yes,

419
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:45.763
and in reality.

420
00:43:47.388 --> 00:43:49.513
Too bad.
I'm not taking them.


421
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:54.805
Requiescat in pace.

422
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.472
Same old Barny!

423
00:44:03.138 --> 00:44:05.388
I'll take your foreigners.

424
00:44:05.555 --> 00:44:07.430
I was pulling your leg.

425
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.263
I'll send them over.

426
00:44:22.888 --> 00:44:23.888
Barny!

427
00:44:32.888 --> 00:44:34.013
Bacon!

428
00:44:41.305 --> 00:44:42.555
When I got home,

429
00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:45.847
I found them asleep
on their suitcases.


430
00:44:49.555 --> 00:44:52.180
Lucienne's expecting you.
Hurry.


431
00:45:15.138 --> 00:45:16.888
You disgust me.

432
00:45:17.055 --> 00:45:19.597
And yet I'd give my life for you.

433
00:45:21.638 --> 00:45:24.638
I can't take it any more.
This has been going on too long.


434
00:45:24.805 --> 00:45:26.513
If my husband doesn't escape,
too bad for him.


435
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.722
She may be a concierge,
but my mother agrees with me.


436
00:45:28.888 --> 00:45:31.013
Here, take these to professor Dumas.

437
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.513
Yes, ma'am.
Can you please give me the address?


438
00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.930
No. Find it yourself, damn it!

439
00:45:42.138 --> 00:45:43.388
That has to go out tonight.

440
00:45:44.805 --> 00:45:46.888
Did you have servants in the old days?

441
00:45:47.097 --> 00:45:51.305
She has a concierge complex,
aggravated by marital deprivation.


442
00:45:51.472 --> 00:45:53.555
What did you just say?

443
00:45:53.722 --> 00:45:57.597
I can understand your anger,
but not this senseless cruelty.


444
00:45:57.763 --> 00:46:01.222
Who says it's easier to resist cruelty
than anger?


445
00:46:01.388 --> 00:46:04.555
I guess you didn't hear
about the woman in your situation.


446
00:46:04.722 --> 00:46:06.130
Aryan, dead Jewish husband.

447
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.233
Her two children
were taken away by the Gestapo.


448
00:46:09.287 --> 00:46:11.288
I'll insist
that he wasn't France's father.


449
00:46:12.305 --> 00:46:14.342
I'll make up an Aryan father.

450
00:46:14.443 --> 00:46:17.497
A friend of mine who looks like her
who won't deny it.


451
00:46:36.638 --> 00:46:40.222
That hurt! I swear I saw stars.

452
00:46:43.513 --> 00:46:47.388
That Barny.
When she puts her mind to something...


453
00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:01.135
One Sunday,
I decided to leave Dimitri...


454
00:47:01.236 --> 00:47:04.088
in the care of the farmer
my daughter was with.


455
00:47:07.305 --> 00:47:08.722
Do you like that?

456
00:47:08.888 --> 00:47:10.305
Tell me!

457
00:47:15.305 --> 00:47:17.180
They're asking for papers.

458
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:24.430
They're doing what?

459
00:47:24.597 --> 00:47:27.347
We'll go through the fields to see France,
it'll be much nicer.


460
00:47:27.513 --> 00:47:31.138
See those trees? We'll go down
there and gather grass for the rabbits.


461
00:47:31.305 --> 00:47:32.305
Help me.

462
00:47:45.847 --> 00:47:46.972
Hello.

463
00:47:52.388 --> 00:47:53.722
Hello, Mrs Barny.

464
00:47:53.888 --> 00:47:56.539
This is Dimitri.
He'll be staying with you.


465
00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.247
You'll have a little playmate.

466
00:47:58.913 --> 00:48:00.947
Why aren't you being nice to him?

467
00:48:01.513 --> 00:48:04.430
You know very well
that my friend is Titi Serpolet.


468
00:48:04.597 --> 00:48:06.998
He looks after five cows.
Five!


469
00:48:10.163 --> 00:48:11.372
Go on.

470
00:48:12.597 --> 00:48:15.513
Why are your white shoes dyed black?

471
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.622
They weren't white any more,
she got them all dirty.


472
00:48:17.722 --> 00:48:20.722
You should've cleaned them,
not dyed them black!


473
00:48:20.888 --> 00:48:22.555
That's what she wanted.

474
00:48:22.722 --> 00:48:26.597
- And why may I ask?
- Because my daddy is dead.


475
00:48:27.847 --> 00:48:29.638
- Good day, Mr Lathuile.
- Good day, Mrs Barny.


476
00:48:45.055 --> 00:48:46.388
What are you doing here?

477
00:48:46.555 --> 00:48:49.680
There wasn't a trace of make-up
on Christine's face.


478
00:48:49.847 --> 00:48:52.263
The earrings were gone from her ears.

479
00:48:53.513 --> 00:48:55.263
Are you out of make-up?

480
00:48:56.347 --> 00:48:59.388
- No, I took it off.
- Why?


481
00:49:00.597 --> 00:49:02.972
I'm going to see my spiritual advisor.

482
00:49:03.138 --> 00:49:07.597
- It's not Léon Morin, is it?
- Yes, Father Morin.


483
00:49:07.763 --> 00:49:12.138
- And what are you doing here?
- I was going there, but you go ahead.


484
00:49:12.305 --> 00:49:14.055
Wait, don't go!

485
00:49:18.847 --> 00:49:22.263
It's funny that we ran
into each other there.


486
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.513
When I went to see him
for the first time, I thought,


487
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.597
"This is exactly what I need."

488
00:49:27.763 --> 00:49:29.180
But he's not in your neighbourhood.

489
00:49:29.347 --> 00:49:32.222
No, Danièle Holdenberg took me.

490
00:49:32.388 --> 00:49:34.013
Yes, I remember.

491
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.763
Danièle told me that she went to see
a priest from time to time.


492
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:40.263
I don't know why,
but sometimes I just want to hit him.


493
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:44.972
- Are you and Danièle Catholic?
- Not in the same way.


494
00:49:45.138 --> 00:49:46.888
To her,
religion's like the history of France.


495
00:49:47.055 --> 00:49:48.055
And you?

496
00:49:49.013 --> 00:49:52.805
It's different for me.
It runs in my family's blood.


497
00:49:53.722 --> 00:49:56.722
Did he say anything to you about me?

498
00:49:57.847 --> 00:50:00.222
He said you were a funny girl.

499
00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:04.472
- That's all?
- I shouldn't repeat it.


500
00:50:04.638 --> 00:50:08.388
He said, "She is closer to God
than my parishioners."


501
00:50:09.972 --> 00:50:11.388
Did Mrs Sangredin tell you?

502
00:50:11.597 --> 00:50:14.680
About your antics? Yes, she did.

503
00:50:15.055 --> 00:50:19.222
Unsure if he meant the slap
or the caress on the stairs,


504
00:50:19.388 --> 00:50:21.055
I needed to know.

505
00:50:21.222 --> 00:50:24.013
I love a young woman.

506
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:28.597
Barely spoken,
this dead truth came back to life.


507
00:50:28.763 --> 00:50:31.430
I was gripped by the thought of Sabine.

508
00:50:32.305 --> 00:50:34.805
Of course.
All the men your age have left.


509
00:50:34.972 --> 00:50:37.430
You're a man my age.

510
00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:41.472
It's not the same.
That's something else.


511
00:50:42.347 --> 00:50:45.097
- A young girl. At your workplace?
- Yes.


512
00:50:46.138 --> 00:50:50.180
She's beautiful, intelligent.
She runs everything.


513
00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:53.888
She is like a beam of black light.

514
00:50:54.055 --> 00:50:55.847
Her name is Sabine.

515
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:57.805
Why don't you bring her here?

516
00:50:58.013 --> 00:51:00.888
She'd never come.
I'm her subordinate.


517
00:51:02.055 --> 00:51:05.055
Plus... I don't love her
the way I used to.


518
00:51:05.263 --> 00:51:08.972
You never did love her.
You don't know what love is.


519
00:51:09.138 --> 00:51:11.388
You've withdrawn into yourself.

520
00:51:15.222 --> 00:51:18.805
I can't help it.
Hearing that fills me with joy.


521
00:51:18.972 --> 00:51:22.638
Without even knowing what it is,
without hoping it's the Resistance.


522
00:51:22.805 --> 00:51:25.222
I know that lots of people
are dying a tragic death,


523
00:51:25.388 --> 00:51:27.847
yet the more I think about it,
the happier it makes me.


524
00:51:28.013 --> 00:51:29.597
When sparks fly,
I want to be there, too.


525
00:51:29.763 --> 00:51:32.472
Simply for the pleasure of it.

526
00:51:32.638 --> 00:51:36.597
I'm exactly the same way.
We're all a pathetic bunch.


527
00:51:36.763 --> 00:51:39.055
We like destruction, fighting.

528
00:51:39.222 --> 00:51:43.972
Human nature is corrupt,
but we shouldn't accept it.


529
00:51:44.138 --> 00:51:46.097
This war has changed our way of life.

530
00:51:46.263 --> 00:51:49.847
There are always people in my room.

531
00:51:50.013 --> 00:51:52.972
- They sleep in my bed.
- Who are they?


532
00:51:53.138 --> 00:51:56.972
Jews, of course.
You take one in, and others come.


533
00:51:57.138 --> 00:52:00.722
I almost need a machine
to issue all the baptism certificates.


534
00:52:00.888 --> 00:52:02.222
I'm in trouble with the diocese.

535
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:08.847
Mrs Lathuile couldn't keep France,
so I decided to take her back


536
00:52:09.013 --> 00:52:11.805
until I found another family for her.

537
00:52:11.972 --> 00:52:13.472
She went to school with them.

538
00:52:13.638 --> 00:52:16.597
She came home beaming one day.

539
00:52:21.388 --> 00:52:25.180
Mummy, today I did everything right,
I understood all of it.


540
00:52:25.347 --> 00:52:28.972
- All of what?
- You know who did it?


541
00:52:29.138 --> 00:52:31.263
- Who?
- God.


542
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:33.388
- Who told you that?
- The man!


543
00:52:33.555 --> 00:52:35.680
- What man?
- The priest.


544
00:52:37.305 --> 00:52:39.055
- Where?
- At catechism.


545
00:52:39.222 --> 00:52:41.972
- Where did you go to catechism?
- In the church.


546
00:52:42.138 --> 00:52:43.555
You were in a church?

547
00:52:43.722 --> 00:52:46.263
It wasn't me.
Lucinda Trivoli took me there.


548
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:48.513
They gave me a little book.

549
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.430
At your age, they give you
a little bread without a ration card.


550
00:52:52.597 --> 00:52:54.763
Now I know God.

551
00:52:55.847 --> 00:52:56.930
You didn't see him.

552
00:52:57.097 --> 00:52:59.847
I can't see him, he doesn't have a body.
But it doesn't matter.


553
00:53:02.555 --> 00:53:06.555
Lucienne Bernhardt introduced me
to Renne and Aimée Plantain,


554
00:53:06.722 --> 00:53:11.680
two old maids living in the country
who wanted to take in a child.


555
00:53:11.847 --> 00:53:14.638
When I was young, someone told me
I had beautiful hair.


556
00:53:14.805 --> 00:53:17.430
A pity for a worker's daughter
to have such pretty hair.


557
00:53:17.597 --> 00:53:23.097
My boyfriend's mother didn't let us get
married because of class differences.


558
00:53:23.263 --> 00:53:27.513
He died of Spanish influenza,
and then she couldn't have him, either.


559
00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.680
Aimée!

560
00:53:31.097 --> 00:53:32.722
- Can you take that off?
- Why?


561
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:37.513
I need to look people in the eye.
I hate all barriers.


562
00:53:38.055 --> 00:53:41.347
Like the pillars in the church
that prevent the faithful


563
00:53:41.513 --> 00:53:42.805
from seeing the altar.

564
00:53:42.972 --> 00:53:45.638
And the darkness, too. It's awful.

565
00:53:45.805 --> 00:53:50.222
We should have huge, modern churches
flooded with sunlight.


566
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:51.930
Religious skyscrapers.

567
00:53:52.138 --> 00:53:55.555
No, but an all-glass cathedral
would be good.


568
00:53:57.472 --> 00:54:00.763
Someone's mistaking the presbytery
for a bedsit.


569
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:38.555
Just put it on the billiard table.

570
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.305
Who is it?

571
00:54:46.472 --> 00:54:47.888
I don't know them.

572
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.097
What does the priest say
of your Vichyism?


573
00:54:51.263 --> 00:54:56.597
He says he'll help me if they stand me
against a wall after the liberation.


574
00:54:56.763 --> 00:54:59.763
- What did you do with your hair?
- It's him.


575
00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:03.722
He threatened to stop giving
me absolution if I kept dying my hair.


576
00:55:03.888 --> 00:55:08.722
He knows exactly how much it costs.
He must have a penitent hairdresser.


577
00:55:08.888 --> 00:55:13.472
He recommended that I imitate
the simplicity of Communist women.


578
00:55:13.638 --> 00:55:17.722
I understood right away.
By Communist women, he meant you.


579
00:55:17.888 --> 00:55:21.847
You've completely Sovietised him.
And you did a good job, too.


580
00:55:22.013 --> 00:55:24.513
No, he's the one who Communised me.

581
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.305
I told him that my mother
reproaches young Communists


582
00:55:27.472 --> 00:55:29.888
for committing before maturity.

583
00:55:30.055 --> 00:55:35.180
He replied, "They're right. They attain
maturity through commitment."


584
00:55:39.763 --> 00:55:43.097
A meadow stretched out
before the Plantain sisters' home.


585
00:55:43.263 --> 00:55:48.180
Every morning, new German recruits
would do their training there.


586
00:56:16.013 --> 00:56:17.513
Have you been good?

587
00:56:22.513 --> 00:56:23.638
Yes.

588
00:56:25.888 --> 00:56:29.097
Long have I loved you

589
00:56:29.263 --> 00:56:32.638
Never will I forget you

590
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:37.013
Are you staying here?

591
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:41.222
No, we're being relieved.
We're going to Russia.


592
00:56:41.388 --> 00:56:44.013
I really wanted you to stay this time.

593
00:57:00.555 --> 00:57:01.930
She's not too much trouble?

594
00:57:02.097 --> 00:57:05.763
No, she's a very good little girl,
and intelligent, too.


595
00:57:06.847 --> 00:57:09.097
Does she work hard in school at least?

596
00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:14.430
Yes. The teacher died,
but they replaced her with someone else.


597
00:57:14.638 --> 00:57:18.472
When you die, what do you want me
to put on your gravestone?


598
00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.180
Nothing expensive, because
I need money to raise my children.


599
00:57:24.305 --> 00:57:27.430
What's that?
Who gave you that bracelet?


600
00:57:27.597 --> 00:57:30.805
My friend Günther.

601
00:57:31.013 --> 00:57:32.222
Your friend Günther?

602
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:35.930
Yes, a very nice German boy
that I love.


603
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:39.930
Summer came.

604
00:57:41.305 --> 00:57:45.597
The Germans decreed an 8pm curfew
for an indefinite period.


605
00:57:45.763 --> 00:57:48.638
I couldn't go to Morin
and I had books to return.


606
00:57:49.305 --> 00:57:53.555
I took a chance and went over there
one Saturday morning.


607
00:59:43.722 --> 00:59:47.263
Will there be holy sacrament
this evening?


608
00:59:48.472 --> 00:59:51.597
Here's the key, 
I'll join you upstairs.

609
00:59:57.472 --> 01:00:02.597
I was shocked by the way
he acted in front of strangers.


610
01:00:02.763 --> 01:00:07.347
I 'd never seen anyone so careless
of what people might say.


611
01:00:36.388 --> 01:00:38.347
Here, I kept this for you.

612
01:00:40.263 --> 01:00:42.180
You won't accept anything from others?

613
01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:45.805
Yes, haven't I been accepting
the gift of your time?


614
01:00:45.972 --> 01:00:50.222
The gift? That's right,
I've been giving you my time.


615
01:00:50.388 --> 01:00:54.055
- Now eat this pear.
- No, thank you, Father.


616
01:00:54.222 --> 01:00:55.513
That's pride.

617
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.805
You're more bourgeois
than the bourgeois you despise.


618
01:00:58.972 --> 01:01:00.722
- Do you want it?
- Yes.


619
01:01:00.888 --> 01:01:03.513
- Take it.
- No, thank you, Father.


620
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.805
Fine. I'll give it to someone less
foolish. You have to be simple in life.


621
01:01:08.972 --> 01:01:12.430
- Are you simple?
- I don't know.


622
01:01:12.597 --> 01:01:14.555
Do I give you the impression
that I'm simple?


623
01:01:14.722 --> 01:01:16.888
You don't give me any impression.

624
01:01:18.763 --> 01:01:21.722
- And you, Father, are you simple?
- Yes.


625
01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:25.347
Yes, I think so.

626
01:01:25.513 --> 01:01:28.222
- What do you think of me?
- Nothing.


627
01:01:28.388 --> 01:01:30.305
What do you mean "nothing"?
That's not possible.


628
01:01:30.472 --> 01:01:34.305
If I don't judge you, no one
will ask me how worthy you are.


629
01:01:34.472 --> 01:01:35.930
Oh, come on.

630
01:01:36.555 --> 01:01:41.305
When I stand before you like this,
what effect do I have on you?


631
01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:44.180
You have the effect of an embryo.

632
01:01:45.013 --> 01:01:47.222
You accuse me of pride.

633
01:01:47.555 --> 01:01:51.972
- What's wrong with being proud?
- It's a lack of self-respect.


634
01:01:52.138 --> 01:01:55.472
On the contrary, it's a great deal
of respect for oneself.


635
01:01:55.638 --> 01:01:57.513
It's lying to oneself.

636
01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.888
Lying? How so?

637
01:02:00.055 --> 01:02:02.430
By assuming more importance
than you have.


638
01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:08.097
The angelus rang. He'd have to enact
a scene from a Millet painting


639
01:02:08.263 --> 01:02:11.055
or not answer the call of the church.

640
01:02:11.263 --> 01:02:14.972
Appear ridiculous or inadequate.

641
01:02:15.138 --> 01:02:16.930
Do you know the angelus?

642
01:02:21.347 --> 01:02:24.888
The Angel declared to Mary
that she would become the mother of God.


643
01:02:25.055 --> 01:02:27.305
And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.

644
01:02:27.513 --> 01:02:29.847
And the Word was made Flesh.

645
01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:33.888
And dwelt among us.
Holy mother of God, pray for us.


646
01:02:37.347 --> 01:02:40.972
And if you were not above
such things, you would reply,


647
01:02:41.138 --> 01:02:45.222
"That we may be made worthy
of the promises of Christ."


648
01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:53.013
You should paint your toenails.

649
01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.597
- You need a husband.
- Yes, well,


650
01:03:03.763 --> 01:03:05.055
I make love with a piece of wood.

651
01:03:05.972 --> 01:03:08.305
- You could hurt yourself.
- I don't injure easily.


652
01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.930
When there are gaps in the conversation,

653
01:03:16.097 --> 01:03:19.055
are you giving the Holy Spirit
time to whisper a reply?


654
01:03:21.138 --> 01:03:24.763
My poor girl, you really like
to string words together.


655
01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:28.180
You haven't answered my question,
Father.


656
01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:32.097
Are your silences
really asides with the Holy Spirit?


657
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.513
When I talked through my hat
as a child, I was told,


658
01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.597
"Go to the hayloft.
You can talk to the walls."


659
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:53.472
Why do I behave so poorly with you?

660
01:03:54.013 --> 01:03:57.847
It's how you are. It'll pass.

661
01:03:59.763 --> 01:04:01.180
I'm leaving.

662
01:04:05.138 --> 01:04:07.430
You're not taking a book today?

663
01:04:08.972 --> 01:04:10.555
No hard feelings?

664
01:04:42.805 --> 01:04:46.180
What's wrong, Sabine?
What's happened?


665
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:54.055
My mother wrote that my brother's
been arrested by the Gestapo.


666
01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.972
She received a letter saying
he'd be taken to Germany,


667
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.430
ending with the words,
"Long live France."


668
01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:07.013
They heard nothing more of him.

669
01:05:08.097 --> 01:05:10.513
Sabine ran the offices as usual.

670
01:05:15.013 --> 01:05:19.347
Her face became hollow,
and lost almost all its beauty.


671
01:05:20.305 --> 01:05:24.305
Type up three copies of this
and have the director sign them.


672
01:05:32.472 --> 01:05:35.888
Within a few weeks
she had aged several years.


673
01:05:56.638 --> 01:05:58.263
Excuse me.

674
01:05:59.263 --> 01:06:01.180
Please come in, ma'am.

675
01:06:11.347 --> 01:06:14.722
So what's going on,
my little swamp frog?


676
01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:17.347
I think that

677
01:06:17.472 --> 01:06:21.763
what repulses me about Christianity
is its self-interested character.


678
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:23.305
You force yourself to do this,

679
01:06:23.472 --> 01:06:26.680
deprive yourself of doing that,
just to go to Heaven.


680
01:06:26.847 --> 01:06:29.430
When you sow seeds,
don't you want them to grow?


681
01:06:29.597 --> 01:06:32.263
That's what Heaven is, the grain rising.

682
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:35.013
Do you remember when our Lord
spoke of this?


683
01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:38.263
- Your Lord.
- He's just as much yours as he is mine.


684
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:39.972
Not if I refuse to accept him.

685
01:06:40.138 --> 01:06:43.388
You can refuse to accept that
the world turns. It won't change much.


686
01:06:44.763 --> 01:06:46.222
I've been unhappier than ever

687
01:06:46.388 --> 01:06:50.388
since I came to talk to you
about what interests me.


688
01:06:50.555 --> 01:06:53.472
I can't help but read
the books you lend me,


689
01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.388
yet I can see that they're not good
for me. They're killing me.


690
01:06:59.555 --> 01:07:02.472
I'm tormented, hounded, persecuted.

691
01:07:03.805 --> 01:07:06.888
I feel like I should never
come back here,


692
01:07:07.055 --> 01:07:10.263
but I can't pass
up the chance to come.

693
01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:16.555
We call that the work of grace.

694
01:07:19.263 --> 01:07:21.222
At night I pondered.

695
01:07:21.388 --> 01:07:25.847
Belief in God scales the universe
down to a satisfactory level,


696
01:07:26.013 --> 01:07:28.597
but my discussions with Morin
are disconcerting.


697
01:07:28.763 --> 01:07:33.180
I charge like a ram,
only to find the obstacle gone.


698
01:07:33.347 --> 01:07:37.263
Swept away by momentum,
I fall and don't know where I am.


699
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:42.888
I lose myself for want of an adversary.
Morin is flawless in my eyes.


700
01:07:45.722 --> 01:07:49.430
A part of my attic
was cluttered with junk.


701
01:07:49.597 --> 01:07:52.972
I decided to spend Whit Monday
cleaning it.


702
01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:32.638
That's when disaster struck.

703
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.222
Father, I want to tell you something.

704
01:08:57.097 --> 01:09:00.180
- I'm done for.
- You're done for?


705
01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:06.180
Yes, I converted. 
I'm at your command.

706
01:09:09.263 --> 01:09:10.638
What happened to you?

707
01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:12.180
Nothing.

708
01:09:12.805 --> 01:09:15.930
I want to become Catholic. Again.

709
01:09:16.138 --> 01:09:19.263
- Why?
- I'm cornered, I surrender.


710
01:09:21.097 --> 01:09:23.597
You're tired.
You've been undernourished lately.


711
01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.805
No, I'm not tired.
And we just got potatoes.


712
01:09:28.972 --> 01:09:30.180
Why do you want to convert?

713
01:09:30.722 --> 01:09:33.472
I don't want to, I have to.

714
01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:39.472
What does a conversion mean to you?

715
01:09:39.638 --> 01:09:43.013
- Following Christ's precepts.
- Which ones?


716
01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.555
To always be poor,

717
01:09:47.347 --> 01:09:49.013
love others,

718
01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:52.097
do one's utmost for them.

719
01:09:53.305 --> 01:09:56.472
Renounce oneself, one's interests,

720
01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.472
pray to God, receive the sacraments.

721
01:10:04.597 --> 01:10:06.513
To be received within the Church.

722
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:08.013
You should think about it

723
01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.638
before making a decision
that affects your entire life.


724
01:10:10.847 --> 01:10:15.013
It's not a decision.
I don't have a choice.


725
01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:20.680
It seems like you don't have a choice.
You're a little tense, excited.


726
01:10:20.847 --> 01:10:25.763
No, I was very calm up in the attic,
all by myself.


727
01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:27.513
What happened in the attic?

728
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.513
Nothing at all. Quite the opposite.
Everything was finished.


729
01:10:31.722 --> 01:10:33.222
How's that?

730
01:10:33.388 --> 01:10:35.847
Like the way the armoury blew up.

731
01:10:37.138 --> 01:10:39.263
This girl has lost her mind.

732
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:42.180
I'm converting against my will.

733
01:10:42.347 --> 01:10:46.305
If you're possessed,
we'll have to exorcise you.


734
01:10:46.472 --> 01:10:51.805
Father, you've tried,
in every respect, to Christianise me,


735
01:10:53.013 --> 01:10:56.680
yet now you discourage me
from following your Lord.


736
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:58.033
Why do you want to follow him?

737
01:10:58.138 --> 01:11:01.013
Because I'm not so sure
that what he said was false.


738
01:11:01.222 --> 01:11:05.138
You'll poison your existence.
You'll ruin your life!


739
01:11:05.305 --> 01:11:10.513
Yes, it's true. You're saying
that to test me, obviously.


740
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.972
And I know that nothing worse has
happened, or ever will happen, to me.


741
01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:20.555
You never considered
becoming Protestant?


742
01:11:20.722 --> 01:11:22.513
They're often wonderful people.

743
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.430
Why are you mocking me right now?

744
01:11:25.597 --> 01:11:30.430
I'm not mocking you, just being frank.
All right, what's next?


745
01:11:30.597 --> 01:11:33.597
I need to confess
so I can take communion.


746
01:11:33.763 --> 01:11:36.138
Do I have to go to the church
in my parish?


747
01:11:36.285 --> 01:11:38.285
No, you can come to Saint
-Bernard.

748
01:11:38.382 --> 01:11:39.385
Will you be the one who...

749
01:11:39.485 --> 01:11:41.535
That'd be best
since we know each other.


750
01:11:41.888 --> 01:11:44.288
I hold confession Monday, Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday...


751
01:11:44.389 --> 01:11:46.795
starting at 5:30pm,
until 7:30pm or 8:00pm.


752
01:11:47.722 --> 01:11:50.013
And in the morning before mass.

753
01:11:50.847 --> 01:11:52.555
I'll come tomorrow evening.

754
01:11:52.722 --> 01:11:56.013
If you want.
And if not, that's fine, too.


755
01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.805
Now I've seen it all.

756
01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.138
- Good day, Barny.
- No.


757
01:12:26.347 --> 01:12:28.888
- Why are you so overawed?
- Vanity.


758
01:12:29.097 --> 01:12:33.722
That'll pass, you'll see.
It's nothing at all. Repeat after me.


759
01:12:34.763 --> 01:12:36.847
Lord, illuminate my conscience,

760
01:12:37.013 --> 01:12:39.930
that I may see all my trespasses
against you


761
01:12:40.097 --> 01:12:42.305
and atone for them
through humble confession,


762
01:12:42.472 --> 01:12:46.013
true contrition and sincere penitence.

763
01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:52.472
Lord, illuminate my conscience,
that I may see all my trespasses against you.


764
01:12:52.638 --> 01:12:55.930
And atone for them
through humble confession.


765
01:12:56.097 --> 01:12:57.555
Do I absolutely have to repeat that?

766
01:12:57.722 --> 01:13:01.055
Yes, but take your time.
There's no rush.


767
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:06.388
- And atone for them...
- Through humble confession.


768
01:13:06.555 --> 01:13:10.347
Through humble confession,
sincere contrition and true penitence.


769
01:13:10.513 --> 01:13:13.972
Thy spirit is good,
lead me into the land of uprightness.


770
01:13:14.138 --> 01:13:17.347
Thy spirit is good,
lead me into the land of uprightness.


771
01:13:17.513 --> 01:13:20.430
Revive me in your fairness.

772
01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:23.513
Revive me in your fairness.

773
01:13:24.722 --> 01:13:26.805
Your hands are still pure, right?

774
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:31.013
No.

775
01:13:32.337 --> 01:13:33.540
No, Father.

776
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:36.222
Your body is the temple
of the Holy Spirit.


777
01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:39.538
You should have more respect for it.

778
01:13:41.472 --> 01:13:43.263
Don't you find
the human organism marvellous?


779
01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.622
Yes.

780
01:13:44.722 --> 01:13:47.263
Then you should not tarnish it.

781
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:50.013
- You'll no longer be sinful.
- No.


782
01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.555
Are you nice at work?

783
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.263
The others hate me because I converted.

784
01:13:57.472 --> 01:14:00.180
- And do you like them?
- I can't.


785
01:14:00.347 --> 01:14:05.597
I love God, if he exists, because he is
perfect and omnipotent. But them...


786
01:14:06.888 --> 01:14:10.847
"if a man say, I love God,
and hateth his brother, he is a liar."


787
01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.430
It's in Saint John.

788
01:14:14.305 --> 01:14:16.138
Anything else wrong?

789
01:14:16.722 --> 01:14:19.513
- Yes.
- What is it?


790
01:14:19.972 --> 01:14:24.805
The first time I came here, I lied
to myself when I said it was a mockery.


791
01:14:26.347 --> 01:14:31.055
I feel like I've been acting for months,
that I've been hiding, that I ran away.


792
01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:34.472
That's called resistance to grace.

793
01:14:34.638 --> 01:14:37.055
- Is that all?
- Yes.


794
01:14:38.472 --> 01:14:41.347
For those sins, simply say this once,

795
01:14:41.513 --> 01:14:45.055
"Lord, let me love my neighbour
as myself, out of love for you."


796
01:14:48.888 --> 01:14:52.888
I was devastated
by the tightness of that penitence.


797
01:14:54.555 --> 01:14:57.597
You should start going to catechism.

798
01:14:57.763 --> 01:14:59.888
I've been going for a long time.

799
01:15:00.055 --> 01:15:04.388
- What? Why didn't you tell me?
- You wouldn't have liked it.


800
01:15:04.555 --> 01:15:08.138
- Why didn't the Plantains tell me?
- They don't know.


801
01:15:08.305 --> 01:15:11.180
- When do you go?
- After school.


802
01:15:11.347 --> 01:15:14.513
- Don't they worry when you're late?
- I tell them I was held back.


803
01:15:15.013 --> 01:15:18.347
I'm so glad you're back.
I'm suffering terribly.


804
01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:19.930
Why?

805
01:15:21.472 --> 01:15:25.388
Imagine a snail torn from its shell,
still alive.


806
01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:28.930
Covered with wounds that it drags
through the dirt and the pebbles.


807
01:15:29.097 --> 01:15:31.222
The sun will dry the wounds.

808
01:15:32.472 --> 01:15:36.680
How could you, who are capable
of true friendship, be a collaborator?


809
01:15:36.847 --> 01:15:39.222
It's the only way France
will pull through.


810
01:15:39.388 --> 01:15:41.347
Even if that was true,

811
01:15:41.513 --> 01:15:44.263
even if the Resistance
was doomed to failure,


812
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:48.222
even if collaboration
was France's only means of survival,


813
01:15:48.388 --> 01:15:51.680
you would not, as a Christian,
have the right to accept those means.


814
01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:53.180
And why not?

815
01:15:53.347 --> 01:15:56.263
Because France is better off dead
than living in a state of mortal sin.


816
01:15:56.430 --> 01:16:00.805
France is not in mortal sin because it
accepts collaboration as a lesser evil.


817
01:16:01.013 --> 01:16:05.930
Yes, because it accepts the deportation
and killing of innocent people.


818
01:16:06.097 --> 01:16:09.097
Like Sabine's brother, for example.
And thousands of others.


819
01:16:09.263 --> 01:16:11.680
The Resistance draws retaliation,
nothing more!


820
01:16:11.888 --> 01:16:14.597
In other words, you, a Catholic,

821
01:16:14.763 --> 01:16:17.680
consent to my daughter being deported
so that yours can have her milk.


822
01:16:17.888 --> 01:16:20.847
You think we should sacrifice
our own people for nothing?


823
01:16:21.888 --> 01:16:24.347
Deportees are your people, too.

824
01:16:24.597 --> 01:16:26.430
The Yids, you mean?

825
01:16:26.638 --> 01:16:27.847
Exactly.

826
01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.847
- Our Lord is a Yid.
- Yes.


827
01:16:32.847 --> 01:16:35.305
What I want is to get married.

828
01:16:35.472 --> 01:16:40.305
I'm making a trousseau
with buttoned shirts for breastfeeding.


829
01:16:40.472 --> 01:16:44.888
The worst part is, I'm always
being followed by boys in the street.


830
01:16:45.097 --> 01:16:49.138
Arlette, I'd like to introduce you
to someone who may be able to help.


831
01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.847
A priest with a particular interest
in young people.


832
01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:53.805
- Is he young?
- Yes.


833
01:16:54.013 --> 01:16:56.013
- How old is he?
- The same age as me.


834
01:16:56.222 --> 01:16:58.555
- When can we go?
- How about tomorrow?


835
01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:19.472
Hello. Please come in.

836
01:17:27.555 --> 01:17:29.055
He's handsome.

837
01:17:33.513 --> 01:17:35.555
After Arlette said it,

838
01:17:36.513 --> 01:17:39.597
I realised that Morin
was indeed handsome.


839
01:17:40.972 --> 01:17:43.638
I asked myself, shadowed by worry,

840
01:17:43.805 --> 01:17:48.305
if it was a sin to delight in
the appearance of my confessor.


841
01:17:49.638 --> 01:17:53.180
No, I assured myself,
what harm could there be in that?


842
01:17:53.347 --> 01:17:56.305
We learn in the Gospel
that Jesus was handsome.


843
01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:58.430
Beauty is a gift of God.

844
01:17:59.013 --> 01:18:05.388
Thank you, Lord, for making your
servant, Morin, a work of perfection.


845
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:08.430
...my brothers and me.

846
01:18:08.597 --> 01:18:11.097
Arlette already seemed less flighty.

847
01:18:11.847 --> 01:18:17.013
Morin had the ability to make all
those that he welcomed more like him.


848
01:18:17.222 --> 01:18:18.888
I would like to illuminate it.

849
01:18:19.097 --> 01:18:22.180
I don't take communion often.
It brings me no joy.


850
01:18:23.555 --> 01:18:28.472
You think it brings me joy?
You ask too much of communion.


851
01:18:30.347 --> 01:18:32.180
I...

852
01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.930
I have errands to run. Excuse me.

853
01:18:42.055 --> 01:18:45.472
Did you see?
The hotel Clarmont was blown up.


854
01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:50.638
Didn't you see it?
I thought it was on your way.


855
01:18:50.805 --> 01:18:52.388
Yes, it is on my way.

856
01:18:54.222 --> 01:18:57.847
You walked through the rubble
without noticing it was gone?


857
01:18:58.013 --> 01:18:59.805
No, I didn't notice.

858
01:19:02.055 --> 01:19:04.472
Well, that's not good at all.

859
01:19:04.638 --> 01:19:09.222
- I've always been absent-minded.
- Yes, but this is going too far.


860
01:19:09.388 --> 01:19:13.888
What does it matter?
Why are you worrying about it?


861
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:18.430
Failing to notice that the Clarmont
was blown up is not a sin.


862
01:19:18.597 --> 01:19:21.430
Your head's too high up in the clouds.

863
01:19:23.097 --> 01:19:28.013
On my way back, I crossed the square
where the Clarmont had been.


864
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:34.847
My recent blindness troubled me.

865
01:19:38.222 --> 01:19:40.805
I'm going to see Morin again
next Saturday.


866
01:19:40.972 --> 01:19:44.597
He lent me a book
and asked me to summarise it for him.


867
01:19:44.763 --> 01:19:48.847
When we parted, he said,
"Goodbye, little butterfly!"


868
01:19:49.013 --> 01:19:50.138
What book?

869
01:19:50.305 --> 01:19:52.888
It's really hard to read!
I don't understand a word of it.


870
01:19:53.055 --> 01:19:56.555
It's called The Beautiful Risk
of Faith. I'll never finish it.


871
01:19:56.722 --> 01:19:59.055
I can't possibly go back unless I do.

872
01:20:03.138 --> 01:20:08.222
Father, a friend of mine is divorcing
and I think she needs you.


873
01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:09.472
How's that?

874
01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:13.013
She's giving moral support
to five lovers.


875
01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.888
Two in the Milice,
one in the Resistance,


876
01:20:16.055 --> 01:20:19.097
one in the black market
and one in Germany.


877
01:20:19.263 --> 01:20:22.222
She works at the bank
and has very little time to serve


878
01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:25.513
the Resistance, Vichy
and Germany all at the same time.


879
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.888
She's having trouble
managing her appointments,


880
01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:29.138
and is trafficking gold, too.

881
01:20:29.305 --> 01:20:32.805
I'd like to meet this interesting person.

882
01:20:44.347 --> 01:20:48.097
Hello. I'd like you to meet my friend
Marion Lamirale.


883
01:20:48.263 --> 01:20:49.513
Come in.

884
01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:01.972
You're missing an earring.

885
01:21:02.138 --> 01:21:07.097
Yes, I forgot to put it back on
after being on the telephone.


886
01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:11.097
- How old are you?
- Twenty-six too.


887
01:21:11.263 --> 01:21:14.722
I thought so.
We were in the same class.


888
01:21:14.888 --> 01:21:16.847
So what do you do in life?

889
01:21:18.763 --> 01:21:20.138
Lots of things.

890
01:21:21.847 --> 01:21:23.055
Such as?

891
01:21:23.847 --> 01:21:26.222
A divorce, for starters.

892
01:21:26.388 --> 01:21:27.888
And why, may I ask?

893
01:21:28.888 --> 01:21:32.930
He doesn't want me any more.
There are good reasons for that.


894
01:21:36.972 --> 01:21:38.972
The priest went to see
Marion's husband.


895
01:21:39.138 --> 01:21:41.222
- What for?
- To ask him to take her back.


896
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.763
- Did he say yes?
- What do you think?


897
01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:45.888
The priest was lucky
to get a civil welcome.


898
01:21:46.055 --> 01:21:51.722
One thing is certain, Marion has a crush
on the priest. Says he'll be hers.


899
01:21:51.888 --> 01:21:52.972
Can you understand such a thing?

900
01:21:53.138 --> 01:21:56.888
I can't.
It wouldn't even cross my mind.


901
01:21:57.055 --> 01:22:00.805
I couldn't overlook the fact
that a priest is a consecrated man.


902
01:22:01.013 --> 01:22:04.055
But sacrilege doesn't bother Marion.

903
01:22:04.222 --> 01:22:06.638
To her, he's a
man and she wants him.

904
01:22:06.805 --> 01:22:09.097
Does she really think she can have him?

905
01:22:09.305 --> 01:22:13.305
She's sure of it. She said
she's never failed in that department.


906
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:23.055
You should become a country priest.

907
01:22:25.763 --> 01:22:27.513
I'd be your maid.

908
01:22:33.972 --> 01:22:39.597
There's an idea, except that priests'
maids are supposed to be old and ugly.


909
01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.638
Perhaps a few years from now.

910
01:22:49.472 --> 01:22:52.388
I want to look
at you with loving eyes.

911
01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.222
Your eyes will never be loving to me.

912
01:22:58.388 --> 01:23:01.597
- Because they're not allowed to be?
- No.


913
01:23:01.763 --> 01:23:05.263
No of fence,
but your eyes aren't that pretty.


914
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:08.847
Not enough mascara?
I'll use more next time.


915
01:23:09.013 --> 01:23:12.097
What will it be like
when you've put enough on?


916
01:23:12.263 --> 01:23:13.930
You poor bird-brain.

917
01:23:14.097 --> 01:23:17.555
Perhaps you'll have it
sorted out by next time.


918
01:23:27.097 --> 01:23:32.138
My dear child, 
Christ loves you madly.

919
01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:35.055
You're among his favourites.

920
01:23:35.222 --> 01:23:39.680
And I think Heaven was made
especially for you.


921
01:23:49.305 --> 01:23:50.722
Beloved God,

922
01:23:52.138 --> 01:23:54.305
let me pray like Marion

923
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.138
and with Marion.

924
01:24:09.722 --> 01:24:15.347
Marion of the gold, Marion of the five
lovers, entered the confessional.


925
01:24:16.597 --> 01:24:19.388
I saw Marion in Saint-Bernard.
She confessed.


926
01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:22.805
Yes, but it ends there.
Never get your hopes up with her.


927
01:24:22.972 --> 01:24:26.263
She left town yesterday
with a new protector.


928
01:24:48.763 --> 01:24:51.097
Do you mind hurrying up a bit?

929
01:24:56.263 --> 01:24:58.180
Forgotten how to walk?

930
01:25:11.013 --> 01:25:13.847
Last night someone in the bell tower
shot at the hotel across the street.


931
01:25:14.013 --> 01:25:16.930
It's a hotel that's been requisitioned
by the militiamen.


932
01:25:17.097 --> 01:25:20.347
They live inside with their families,
on the verge of war.


933
01:25:20.513 --> 01:25:25.055
Around 1am, someone shouted
from the street, "Hey, priest!


934
01:25:25.222 --> 01:25:27.597
"For crying out loud,
come down here fast!"


935
01:25:27.763 --> 01:25:32.555
I took my time getting down there.
The bell tower was lit up.


936
01:25:32.722 --> 01:25:37.263
We opened the church,
climbed up there...


937
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:39.638
And the men shooting?

938
01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.013
Vanished.

939
01:26:03.347 --> 01:26:07.555
Father, I don't understand

940
01:26:07.722 --> 01:26:09.805
how Jesus could have died
forsaken by God.


941
01:26:11.013 --> 01:26:12.388
What did you say?

942
01:26:12.555 --> 01:26:16.972
He says before dying,
"My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"


943
01:26:17.638 --> 01:26:18.888
Not at all.

944
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:25.805
Jesus was a Jew and he died a Jew,
reciting Psalm 22, a Jewish prayer.


945
01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:27.138
Here.

946
01:26:35.805 --> 01:26:39.097
"My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?"


947
01:26:40.472 --> 01:26:44.222
"Why art thou so far from helping me,
and from the words of my roaring?"


948
01:26:44.388 --> 01:26:46.888
And it ends with an homage to God.

949
01:26:47.472 --> 01:26:52.430
"For dominion belongs to Jehovah
and he rules over the nations."


950
01:26:52.763 --> 01:26:54.847
Jehovah, the God of Jews
and Christians.


951
01:26:55.055 --> 01:26:56.097
Of course.

952
01:26:56.305 --> 01:27:00.597
It's absurd that I have to remind myself
that Jehovah is God the Father.


953
01:27:00.805 --> 01:27:05.347
You're not the only one. Jesus
didn't choose Psalm 22 by accident.


954
01:27:05.513 --> 01:27:08.388
He chose it
because it applies to him in particular.


955
01:27:08.555 --> 01:27:10.013
He also said,

956
01:27:12.305 --> 01:27:14.597
"They have pierced my hands
and my feet.


957
01:27:14.763 --> 01:27:20.388
"They divide my garments among them
and cast lots for my clothing."


958
01:27:20.972 --> 01:27:25.097
Don't forget that the Old Testament
is the book of the Jews.


959
01:27:25.263 --> 01:27:27.680
The one the Messiah lived by.

960
01:27:27.847 --> 01:27:31.388
Jehovah chose Christ of flesh
and blood for his earthly life,


961
01:27:31.555 --> 01:27:33.972
thus giving himself youth.

962
01:27:34.138 --> 01:27:36.930
He chose to die
in the prime of his life.


963
01:27:37.097 --> 01:27:42.472
God will never age because
he is protected by that blood of youth.


964
01:27:44.638 --> 01:27:47.847
I think that my irritation
with old ladies


965
01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:50.472
who repeat their Our Fathers mindlessly,

966
01:27:50.638 --> 01:27:53.472
and with all the old men
who stop the Church's progress


967
01:27:53.638 --> 01:27:58.055
is a specifically Christian irritation.

968
01:28:01.513 --> 01:28:02.513
Goodbye!

969
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.597
- Gilberte, how are you?
- Fine.


970
01:28:06.763 --> 01:28:09.555
- And Mrs Lathuile?
- OK.


971
01:28:09.722 --> 01:28:10.847
- Going to town?
- Yes.


972
01:28:11.013 --> 01:28:13.597
- Want to go together?
- Let's go.


973
01:28:16.263 --> 01:28:17.763
Going to see France on Sundays,

974
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:23.555
I would often meet Gilberte Lathuile
going into town and we'd chat.


975
01:28:25.763 --> 01:28:27.722
I met Gilberte Lathuile again.

976
01:28:27.888 --> 01:28:30.138
What she does with the Germans
is her business,


977
01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.347
but now we have proof
she's feeding them information.


978
01:28:33.513 --> 01:28:36.347
Come the next raid, she'll be shot.

979
01:28:36.513 --> 01:28:39.972
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Pierre told me.


980
01:28:41.513 --> 01:28:42.972
The next Sunday,

981
01:28:43.138 --> 01:28:45.680
I found meeting Gilberte hard.

982
01:28:46.722 --> 01:28:48.180
Hello, Gilberte.

983
01:28:49.013 --> 01:28:51.347
I was afraid she could read
her death in my eyes.


984
01:28:51.513 --> 01:28:53.055
It was a nice day.

985
01:28:53.222 --> 01:28:55.013
Yes. It was a nice day.

986
01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:59.097
And you haven't many left.
Poor soul.


987
01:29:00.888 --> 01:29:02.847
I'm anxious all the time.

988
01:29:03.763 --> 01:29:07.180
One word from me
would save that girl's life.


989
01:29:07.722 --> 01:29:12.222
Threats would make her break off
all relations with the Germans.


990
01:29:12.388 --> 01:29:15.805
I take communion every morning
and I'm an accomplice to a crime.


991
01:29:15.972 --> 01:29:18.263
To the murder of a young girl.

992
01:29:21.638 --> 01:29:25.430
Why did your friend tell you
what had been decided?


993
01:29:25.597 --> 01:29:28.430
Because she couldn't keep quiet.

994
01:29:28.597 --> 01:29:31.388
Did her husband need to tell her?

995
01:29:31.555 --> 01:29:32.763
No.

996
01:29:34.013 --> 01:29:37.763
- It isn't your concern.
- But I could save a life.


997
01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:42.555
- You want to make yourself important.
- It's not that.


998
01:29:42.722 --> 01:29:45.222
Well, maybe just a little.

999
01:29:46.097 --> 01:29:49.513
But mostly it's the idea
of murder by omission.


1000
01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:53.638
Even if you warned her,
she probably couldn't escape.


1001
01:29:57.638 --> 01:29:59.763
She could leave the village.

1002
01:30:00.513 --> 01:30:03.680
It may have unknown consequences.

1003
01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:06.722
So I should continue playacting?

1004
01:30:07.638 --> 01:30:10.555
Keeping a confidence isn't playacting.

1005
01:30:12.513 --> 01:30:14.930
I must say nothing, do nothing?

1006
01:30:16.097 --> 01:30:17.513
It's hard, I know.

1007
01:30:18.305 --> 01:30:21.597
But I think that's your role
in this story.


1008
01:30:22.805 --> 01:30:25.763
Sadly, there are many such stories
right now.


1009
01:30:27.263 --> 01:30:30.688
The next Sunday,
passing the Lathuiles' house,


1010
01:30:30.955 --> 01:30:32.663
I saw the shutters were closed

1011
01:30:32.772 --> 01:30:34.330
and had red writing on them.

1012
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:37.030
A TRAITOR WHO SOLD HERSELF
TO THE KRAUTS WAS SHOT HERE


1013
01:30:38.055 --> 01:30:41.180
- Do you know what happened?
- No.


1014
01:30:42.263 --> 01:30:45.263
Everyone pretended not to know
what had happened.


1015
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:48.263
All I knew was that
Gilberte's parents had fled.


1016
01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.222
You are not allowed to cross!

1017
01:31:47.388 --> 01:31:48.680
I didn't see it!

1018
01:32:07.013 --> 01:32:09.263
And suddenly,
the atmosphere changed.


1019
01:32:19.097 --> 01:32:23.180
- What is this little boy doing here?
- Leave me alone!


1020
01:32:24.347 --> 01:32:27.930
Not nice, not nice at all.

1021
01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.485
The shoes will return
when the town is free


1022
01:32:35.585 --> 01:32:37.243
FREELY AVAILABLE

1023
01:32:54.055 --> 01:32:56.513
And one morning, the town woke up free.

1024
01:32:59.763 --> 01:33:02.263
The Germans left in the night.

1025
01:33:02.722 --> 01:33:05.222
The Iron Army did a moonlight flit.

1026
01:33:05.847 --> 01:33:08.638
- They'll shoot for sure.
- Maybe not.


1027
01:33:15.138 --> 01:33:16.263
Have a seat.

1028
01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:25.805
We came to ask you
to take your daughter back at once.


1029
01:33:25.972 --> 01:33:29.513
She's a destructive child
and she's wearing us out.


1030
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.263
You didn't have to come to town
just for that. You should've told me.


1031
01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:34.013
I wanted to fetch her anyway.

1032
01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:38.388
We came to see the shorn women paraded,
make the most of the day.


1033
01:34:11.305 --> 01:34:14.722
My bike was stolen,
so I went to get France on foot.


1034
01:36:06.222 --> 01:36:10.013
I tried to cry,
thinking he might be moved.


1035
01:36:16.263 --> 01:36:17.555
Does he want to kill you?

1036
01:36:34.222 --> 01:36:37.388
- My doll's broken!
- No, no.


1037
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:44.972
Are they Germans, too?

1038
01:36:59.222 --> 01:37:01.222
I can't come any more
because my daughter is with me now.


1039
01:37:01.388 --> 01:37:02.722
I can't leave her alone.

1040
01:37:02.888 --> 01:37:06.138
- So we won't see each other any more?
- No.


1041
01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:12.097
- What if I came to your home?
- Thank you.


1042
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:19.513
I can't say when exactly,
but it'll be one of these evenings.


1043
01:37:23.513 --> 01:37:27.263
You little devil.
Now settle down and go to sleep.


1044
01:37:53.097 --> 01:37:54.222
Good evening.

1045
01:38:10.847 --> 01:38:12.138
You're good at gymnastics.

1046
01:38:12.305 --> 01:38:16.055
Yes, we learn things at the seminary,
even boxing.


1047
01:38:17.097 --> 01:38:20.013
Go on to bed now.
You could catch cold.


1048
01:38:21.347 --> 01:38:25.597
I had never spoken to my daughter
about him, nor about his likely visit.


1049
01:38:25.763 --> 01:38:29.555
I was very surprised to see France
acting that way.


1050
01:38:32.805 --> 01:38:35.888
- The First Steps Toward Jesus.
- Thank you.


1051
01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:45.263
If you were my daughter...

1052
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:48.430
I'd like to be your daughter.
Here, look.


1053
01:39:49.763 --> 01:39:53.597
I don't know if it's because
of that book you brought,


1054
01:39:53.763 --> 01:39:55.888
but she's become unbearable.

1055
01:39:56.763 --> 01:40:00.972
When I discipline her, she says,
"You see my mote and not your beam."


1056
01:40:01.138 --> 01:40:03.430
When I threatened her with Hell,
she said,


1057
01:40:03.597 --> 01:40:07.055
"Children don't go to Hell,
only big people."


1058
01:40:07.222 --> 01:40:09.347
I gave her a good spanking.

1059
01:40:09.888 --> 01:40:12.555
You're right to teach your daughter
how to behave,


1060
01:40:12.722 --> 01:40:14.972
but don't go too far.

1061
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:21.138
I received more than my share
of thrashings as a child.


1062
01:40:21.305 --> 01:40:24.472
Half the time I went to bed
without supper.


1063
01:40:24.638 --> 01:40:26.763
Why was your father so harsh?

1064
01:40:29.847 --> 01:40:32.180
Why was your father so strict?

1065
01:40:34.763 --> 01:40:36.680
It wasn't my father.
He never touched me.


1066
01:40:36.847 --> 01:40:38.222
Who, then?

1067
01:40:39.097 --> 01:40:40.472
My mother.

1068
01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.930
Why did she hit you?

1069
01:40:44.513 --> 01:40:49.138
She'd hit me with a branch
when I came home late from school.


1070
01:40:49.305 --> 01:40:52.930
On my calf, you know.
I would grit my teeth.


1071
01:40:53.722 --> 01:40:57.805
- It wasn't your fault you were late.
- Yes, it was.


1072
01:40:59.013 --> 01:41:02.013
We would scrap
the whole way home from school.


1073
01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:03.597
All six kilometres.

1074
01:41:03.763 --> 01:41:05.597
She hit you for that?

1075
01:41:05.763 --> 01:41:08.055
I lied, too. I
told a lot of lies.

1076
01:41:08.222 --> 01:41:10.513
Because you were afraid of her.

1077
01:41:13.305 --> 01:41:15.430
Did she also hit your sisters?

1078
01:41:15.597 --> 01:41:19.180
No, my sisters
kept to the straight and narrow.


1079
01:41:19.347 --> 01:41:23.055
- Your mother was too harsh.
- She meant well.


1080
01:41:25.055 --> 01:41:27.597
You didn't have a happy childhood,
did you?


1081
01:41:27.763 --> 01:41:32.763
Of course I did.
No need to make that face.


1082
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:36.430
I didn't get thrashed every day
or anything. What did you think?


1083
01:41:36.597 --> 01:41:39.347
What made your childhood
a happy one?


1084
01:41:40.805 --> 01:41:44.972
The atmosphere. 
It was nice at home.

1085
01:41:45.138 --> 01:41:46.972
How was it at home?

1086
01:41:47.805 --> 01:41:51.513
We woke up at
6, we left at 7.

1087
01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.388
On Sundays my father went to look after
the goats, taking newspapers with him.


1088
01:41:55.555 --> 01:42:00.013
My mother told me about the time my
father saw a hare on his way to church.


1089
01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:03.180
He said, "I'm going back to the house
to get my gun."


1090
01:42:03.347 --> 01:42:06.347
And then, "No, I might be late
for mass if I do that."


1091
01:42:06.513 --> 01:42:10.180
When he walked by on his way back
from church, the hare was still there.


1092
01:42:10.347 --> 01:42:13.847
He got his gun, shot
it and it was his.

1093
01:42:16.347 --> 01:42:18.888
You don't resent your mother?

1094
01:42:19.055 --> 01:42:21.222
I used to resent her, yes.

1095
01:42:21.388 --> 01:42:24.055
Did you continue to resent her
at the seminary?


1096
01:42:24.222 --> 01:42:28.180
I resented her
until it didn't sting any more.


1097
01:42:28.347 --> 01:42:30.888
How old were you
when you entered the seminary?


1098
01:42:31.055 --> 01:42:34.180
I joined the junior seminary
when I was 12.


1099
01:42:34.888 --> 01:42:40.055
How is it that such a bad boy
wanted to become a priest?


1100
01:42:41.347 --> 01:42:43.805
What does that have to do with it?

1101
01:42:43.972 --> 01:42:47.763
You become a priest
so you can save souls, that's all.


1102
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:51.638
Even a naughty boy
can have an idea like that.


1103
01:42:54.638 --> 01:42:58.305
Your mother was harsher than most.

1104
01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:01.388
But you were a child like any other.

1105
01:43:01.555 --> 01:43:04.180
No, I was among the worst.

1106
01:43:05.097 --> 01:43:09.097
Once, I broke a cow's leg
trying to get it to jump a fence.


1107
01:43:09.263 --> 01:43:13.222
I don't need to tell you that the owner
took great care in tanning my hide.


1108
01:43:13.388 --> 01:43:18.430
It didn't cure you. You're still trying
to get cattle to fly.


1109
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:21.347
That's what I'm here for.

1110
01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:24.555
You're going to break another leg.

1111
01:43:25.263 --> 01:43:26.972
As long as it jumps.

1112
01:44:31.013 --> 01:44:34.972
Brethren,
is it the cold that is making you numb?


1113
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:39.180
I hope the sun
will revive you a little.

1114
01:44:39.347 --> 01:44:41.972
There are those who pray
the rosary during mass,


1115
01:44:42.138 --> 01:44:44.138
but it's not the time do so.

1116
01:44:44.305 --> 01:44:46.763
There are those who want to perform
their devotion by a statue,


1117
01:44:46.972 --> 01:44:48.847
yet the holy sacrament is here,

1118
01:44:49.597 --> 01:44:52.638
amongst you,
expecting you to be present and alive.


1119
01:44:53.388 --> 01:44:57.180
What's more,
everyone leaves before the last Gospel.


1120
01:44:58.055 --> 01:45:02.888
Are you in that much of a hurry to leave
your God, you Sunday Christians?


1121
01:45:03.055 --> 01:45:06.430
Brethren,
let us not be like those disciples


1122
01:45:06.597 --> 01:45:08.930
who, by pressing around our Lord,

1123
01:45:09.097 --> 01:45:11.930
almost stifled him
and prevented others from seeing,


1124
01:45:12.097 --> 01:45:14.138
or even approaching, him.

1125
01:45:15.138 --> 01:45:19.763
If you are merely Christian in name,
you keep the hesitant at bay.


1126
01:45:19.930 --> 01:45:22.555
You strip them of their desire to come.

1127
01:45:22.722 --> 01:45:26.805
Each one of you must be an apostle
in his own circle.


1128
01:45:28.638 --> 01:45:33.222
I also wanted to say,
let us sing mass with more enthusiasm,


1129
01:45:33.388 --> 01:45:35.638
without faltering at the end.

1130
01:45:35.972 --> 01:45:39.097
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.


1131
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:45.513
I am absolutely certain of two facts,

1132
01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.430
and they happen to be contradictory.

1133
01:45:49.055 --> 01:45:54.347
The priest is the most spiritually
elevated man I've ever known.


1134
01:45:54.513 --> 01:45:58.097
And on Sunday,
there isn't a shadow of a doubt


1135
01:45:58.263 --> 01:46:01.097
that he passed by me on purpose,

1136
01:46:01.263 --> 01:46:03.847
brushing his sleeve against me.

1137
01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.388
Can you imagine
what state that put me in?


1138
01:46:07.555 --> 01:46:10.638
Yes, I've noticed.
He does things like that sometimes.


1139
01:46:10.805 --> 01:46:12.597
No wonder he gets an earful
at the diocese.


1140
01:46:12.805 --> 01:46:17.888
You think he does that to be a tease?
That he's just playing around?


1141
01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:23.930
That must be what they call
the glorious freedom of God's children.


1142
01:46:24.097 --> 01:46:28.097
"Love and do what you will."
But it destroys me.


1143
01:46:28.263 --> 01:46:31.388
He does it to stimulate us.
But it's dangerous.


1144
01:46:31.555 --> 01:46:33.888
He's not afraid,
no more so than he is of anything else.


1145
01:46:37.555 --> 01:46:39.222
It was night time.

1146
01:48:12.055 --> 01:48:13.555
Forgive me, Lord.

1147
01:48:15.472 --> 01:48:16.930
Govern my dreams.

1148
01:48:18.388 --> 01:48:22.180
Do not let me trespass,
even in sleep.


1149
01:48:28.805 --> 01:48:29.930
Good evening.

1150
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:34.430
This is for you,
for when the power goes out.


1151
01:48:34.597 --> 01:48:36.388
It's a funeral candle.

1152
01:48:37.263 --> 01:48:39.763
- What were you doing?
- Chopping wood.


1153
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:43.680
- I'll chop some for you.
- No, you don't have to.


1154
01:48:49.555 --> 01:48:53.263
Give me that. Watch out.

1155
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:22.722
There.

1156
01:49:31.138 --> 01:49:32.388
Nice swing.

1157
01:49:37.305 --> 01:49:38.805
Do you have any wire?

1158
01:49:43.388 --> 01:49:45.680
Would you marry me if you were
a Protestant pastor?


1159
01:49:45.847 --> 01:49:47.430
Of course.

1160
01:49:48.972 --> 01:49:51.222
No, I'm asking you seriously.

1161
01:49:51.847 --> 01:49:53.305
I need to know.

1162
01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:58.763
If you were not a priest,
would you take me as your wife?


1163
01:50:07.555 --> 01:50:13.138
In one single move, the hand that had
given me everything took it all away.


1164
01:50:24.347 --> 01:50:27.263
I didn't see him
again for a long time.

1165
01:50:32.805 --> 01:50:37.097
I was walking along the top of the hill
one Sunday,


1166
01:50:38.055 --> 01:50:41.680
high above the town
with its red and pink roofs.


1167
01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:55.263
I couldn't take my eyes
off of a bell tower.


1168
01:51:04.763 --> 01:51:07.347
I thought he must be there
at that moment.


1169
01:51:08.138 --> 01:51:12.805
And since it was time for Vespers,
he must be singing.


1170
01:52:25.722 --> 01:52:29.847
Good evening.
I brought you some books for Danièle.


1171
01:52:32.055 --> 01:52:35.638
Christine said
you'd be going to the sanatorium.


1172
01:52:38.472 --> 01:52:40.388
There's one for you, too.

1173
01:52:41.347 --> 01:52:44.472
Traditional dogmatism
and empiriocriticism.


1174
01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:50.805
It's terribly complex.
I don't think I'll understand it.


1175
01:52:50.972 --> 01:52:52.305
Yes, you will.

1176
01:52:53.097 --> 01:52:56.638
You never struck me
as being a complete idiot.


1177
01:52:59.763 --> 01:53:05.055
Traditional dogmatism.
Do you understand that? Yes? Good.


1178
01:53:06.347 --> 01:53:08.847
And empiriocriticism? No?

1179
01:53:10.138 --> 01:53:14.472
Empiriocriticism is a critical doctrine

1180
01:53:14.638 --> 01:53:16.430
based on empiricism.

1181
01:53:16.597 --> 01:53:21.138
That is,
on the experience considered to be,


1182
01:53:21.305 --> 01:53:24.805
more or less,
the sole source of knowledge.


1183
01:53:38.888 --> 01:53:40.013
Hello?

1184
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:44.555
Empiriocriticism therefore means

1185
01:53:44.722 --> 01:53:47.138
the limits of the experience...

1186
01:53:50.472 --> 01:53:51.763
It's warm.

1187
01:54:00.013 --> 01:54:02.805
Here, look.

1188
01:54:04.555 --> 01:54:05.763
God,

1189
01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:09.097
grant my wish one time.

1190
01:54:12.055 --> 01:54:13.263
Just one time.

1191
01:54:15.805 --> 01:54:19.847
And blessed be the eternal torment
that follows.


1192
01:54:25.930 --> 01:54:27.347
Come here.

1193
01:54:30.763 --> 01:54:34.388
You're not Miss Sabine right now.
Well done, it's better already.


1194
01:54:34.555 --> 01:54:36.680
Look at people when they talk to you.

1195
01:54:38.347 --> 01:54:42.680
If only you summoned God
the way you summon evil. That is prayer.


1196
01:54:42.888 --> 01:54:44.472
You won't come any more.

1197
01:54:46.555 --> 01:54:48.722
Of course I will. 
Why wouldn't I?

1198
01:54:48.888 --> 01:54:52.180
I'd miss discussing hypostasis with you.

1199
01:54:57.388 --> 01:54:59.888
- You're going to have to confess.
- No.


1200
01:55:01.847 --> 01:55:02.888
Say that to someone?

1201
01:55:03.097 --> 01:55:05.888
You'd be saying it to me,
and since I already know...


1202
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:07.763
To you?

1203
01:55:09.722 --> 01:55:14.430
Confessing is a chore for me as well.
I still go, often even.


1204
01:55:14.638 --> 01:55:18.680
You go often, and yet you never sin.

1205
01:55:18.847 --> 01:55:20.638
You accuse yourself
of the sins of others.


1206
01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:22.555
Some avoid punishment.

1207
01:55:22.722 --> 01:55:25.847
You'll come this evening, right?

1208
01:55:26.013 --> 01:55:28.513
From 5:30 onwards, 
I'll wait for you.

1209
01:55:28.722 --> 01:55:30.305
My daughter, after school...

1210
01:55:30.513 --> 01:55:33.555
Bring her.
I'll take her confession, too.


1211
01:55:33.722 --> 01:55:35.263
See you later.

1212
01:56:07.138 --> 01:56:10.055
My soul felt like a brothel.

1213
01:56:22.138 --> 01:56:24.138
Keep your coat on,
we're going to confession.


1214
01:56:24.305 --> 01:56:27.263
- What sins did you commit?
- That's none of your business.


1215
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:29.722
I'll tell you mine
if you tell me yours.

1216
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:37.555
- Help me, Father.
- You don't need it.


1217
01:56:37.722 --> 01:56:39.097
I'm listening.

1218
01:56:40.597 --> 01:56:42.013
I almost...

1219
01:56:42.930 --> 01:56:44.222
I said...

1220
01:56:45.722 --> 01:56:48.180
I don't know what you would call
what I did.


1221
01:56:49.388 --> 01:56:51.472
You're the dead branch right now.

1222
01:56:51.638 --> 01:56:54.597
- Know what happens to dead branches?
- Yes.


1223
01:56:54.763 --> 01:56:57.638
- What?
- They're cut down.


1224
01:56:58.513 --> 01:57:01.930
- And once they're cut, what next?
- They're burned.


1225
01:57:02.472 --> 01:57:05.347
Yes. I'm listening.

1226
01:57:07.138 --> 01:57:08.263
I...

1227
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:11.680
I tried to tempt...

1228
01:57:12.888 --> 01:57:15.013
Please finish your sentences.

1229
01:57:16.888 --> 01:57:19.597
I wanted to lead a priest
to break his vows.


1230
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:22.430
I wanted to break
the ninth commandment.


1231
01:57:23.597 --> 01:57:24.722
There.

1232
01:57:26.263 --> 01:57:30.930
Visit Danièle tomorrow.
Try to do some good with your visit.


1233
01:57:31.097 --> 01:57:33.180
You'll do each other good.

1234
01:57:33.763 --> 01:57:39.013
As penitence, read a page
of that book I lent you every evening.


1235
01:57:41.388 --> 01:57:45.055
Now go wholly in peace.

1236
01:57:50.888 --> 01:57:54.097
I went almost in peace.

1237
01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:01.597
I'm going to preach the Gospel
to the nations of the Earth.


1238
01:58:02.263 --> 01:58:06.055
- Or rather to local villages.
- How's that?


1239
01:58:07.972 --> 01:58:10.888
I'm leaving Saint-Bernard
for a small village.


1240
01:58:11.055 --> 01:58:15.055
But since the other villages in
the region don't have a priest, either,


1241
01:58:15.222 --> 01:58:17.222
I'll visit them in turn.

1242
01:58:17.388 --> 01:58:21.430
There'll be two of us, and two young
girls to help us in another village.


1243
01:58:21.597 --> 01:58:26.013
It's called a mission.
France has become a mission country.


1244
01:58:30.763 --> 01:58:33.305
I'm not thrilled about going there.

1245
01:58:34.513 --> 01:58:36.430
Why not?

1246
01:58:38.097 --> 01:58:41.430
In the country, before you can
talk about serious matters,


1247
01:58:41.597 --> 01:58:45.013
you have to talk about rabbits
and pigs first.


1248
01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:48.055
And I like parish life,
when it's running smoothly.


1249
01:58:48.555 --> 01:58:50.930
It won't be smooth over there.

1250
01:58:51.097 --> 01:58:53.722
The villages are divided by politics.

1251
01:58:55.013 --> 01:59:00.097
Then again, those people have been
without a priest for so long,


1252
01:59:00.263 --> 01:59:02.888
they're completely de
-Christianised,

1253
01:59:03.055 --> 01:59:07.013
so there's no deviation.
It's almost virgin territory.


1254
01:59:07.888 --> 01:59:12.305
But it will take generations
before we accomplish anything.


1255
01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:24.305
- What are you doing?
- Hey, there.


1256
01:59:24.472 --> 01:59:27.472
Watch out for those apples.
They might be rotten.


1257
01:59:27.638 --> 01:59:30.180
I wouldn't mind,
if I knew what you were saying.


1258
01:59:30.347 --> 01:59:32.180
What do you want to know so badly?

1259
01:59:32.347 --> 01:59:34.305
What did God do
before creating the world?


1260
01:59:34.472 --> 01:59:36.555
- Did he do nothing?
- No.


1261
01:59:36.722 --> 01:59:39.555
- So he was bored?
- Perhaps. I don't know.


1262
01:59:40.888 --> 01:59:42.680
He made the world through love.

1263
01:59:42.847 --> 01:59:44.888
Why don't you ask him
what he did before?


1264
01:59:45.055 --> 01:59:46.722
No one can know those things.

1265
01:59:46.888 --> 01:59:49.055
- Not even you?
- No more than anyone else.


1266
01:59:49.222 --> 01:59:53.013
- So we'll never know?
- We'll know when we're dead.


1267
01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:54.847
I want to be dead.

1268
01:59:55.013 --> 01:59:57.097
You can go to bed while you wait.

1269
01:59:57.263 --> 02:00:00.055
And if you get up again
or do something silly,


1270
02:00:00.222 --> 02:00:03.055
I'll be the one to box your ears.
You'll see.


1271
02:00:14.347 --> 02:00:19.013
- I want a prayer that doesn't exist.
- A prayer that doesn't exist?


1272
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:20.930
Yes, a prayer that no one knows,

1273
02:00:21.097 --> 02:00:24.638
so I'm not always saying
the same thing to God. It's not nice.


1274
02:00:24.805 --> 02:00:26.638
We'll do that for you.

1275
02:00:28.347 --> 02:00:33.472
It's not exactly a prayer for
a little girl, but I'll say it anyway.


1276
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:40.888
"Lord, give me what you have left.

1277
02:00:41.055 --> 02:00:43.597
"Give me what no
one ever asks you for.

1278
02:00:43.763 --> 02:00:46.472
"I am not asking
you for rest nor calm,

1279
02:00:46.638 --> 02:00:49.055
"neither of the soul nor of the body.

1280
02:00:49.222 --> 02:00:51.431
"Lord, you are asked for those things
so often...


1281
02:00:51.532 --> 02:00:53.138
"that you must not have any left.

1282
02:00:53.305 --> 02:00:55.305
"Lord, give me what you have left.

1283
02:00:55.472 --> 02:00:57.847
"Give me what people turn down.

1284
02:00:58.013 --> 02:01:00.597
"Give me what the others don't want.

1285
02:01:00.763 --> 02:01:03.138
"And give me courage
and strength as well.


1286
02:01:03.305 --> 02:01:07.472
"You are the only one who can give us
what we cannot obtain for ourselves."


1287
02:01:08.888 --> 02:01:11.138
The irony of God is admirable.

1288
02:01:11.305 --> 02:01:14.847
I passionately hoped that this man
would come into this room.


1289
02:01:15.013 --> 02:01:19.305
And here he is. Not traitorous
and complicit as I'd hoped,


1290
02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:21.680
but pious and beautiful.

1291
02:01:21.847 --> 02:01:26.597
Putting my child, his flock,
to bed with a poem.


1292
02:01:26.763 --> 02:01:30.513
Thank You, Lord,
for loving him more than I do.


1293
02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:34.722
For doing more than I ever asked of you.
Thank you for your sympathy.


1294
02:01:36.472 --> 02:01:40.638
The office moved back to Paris, and
I left around the same time as Morin.


1295
02:01:40.805 --> 02:01:44.680
He said he'd come to bid me farewell,
but the days passed and I wondered,


1296
02:01:44.847 --> 02:01:47.513
with feelings of anguish
mixed with acceptance,


1297
02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:50.013
if he hadn't already left.

1298
02:01:50.222 --> 02:01:54.972
The priest is leaving tomorrow.
He wants you to go and see him.


1299
02:04:08.513 --> 02:04:09.513
Good evening.

1300
02:04:13.222 --> 02:04:14.680
We're setting sail.

1301
02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:33.888
There it was, his only possession.

1302
02:04:40.472 --> 02:04:42.513
I don't have any socks.

1303
02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:45.638
Can I help you finish packing?

1304
02:04:46.888 --> 02:04:49.888
Thank you, but that's everything.

1305
02:04:51.222 --> 02:04:54.347
All I have to do is close up my rucksack.
Tomorrow morning.


1306
02:04:54.972 --> 02:04:57.013
Is the piano there already?

1307
02:04:59.388 --> 02:05:04.847
No, it was a rental. They picked it up.
I won't have time to play there.


1308
02:05:05.305 --> 02:05:06.930
That's sad.

1309
02:05:07.597 --> 02:05:11.305
No, I'll just put
some holes in a reed.

1310
02:05:12.513 --> 02:05:14.222
I'll be going now.

1311
02:05:15.305 --> 02:05:17.097
Thank you for everything.

1312
02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:21.222
You don't have any questions to ask me
on the last night?


1313
02:05:22.597 --> 02:05:25.763
I have questions to last me a lifetime,
so I'd better keep quiet.


1314
02:05:27.722 --> 02:05:31.597
Wipe the chair with that cloth.
Sit down.


1315
02:05:42.930 --> 02:05:45.680
And now, what's the song of the day?

1316
02:05:46.930 --> 02:05:49.388
It's nothing, just a minor point.

1317
02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:55.847
I don't understand.
You said the Jansenists were heretics.


1318
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:59.680
What about the miracle
of the holy thornbush?


1319
02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:04.305
Why wouldn't God
work miracles for heretics?


1320
02:06:04.472 --> 02:06:06.763
You think he loves them
any less than the others?


1321
02:06:08.013 --> 02:06:12.430
You're the one who led me to believe
that God was Catholic.


1322
02:06:13.722 --> 02:06:18.347
We call it universal Catholicism
in our temporal language.


1323
02:06:19.722 --> 02:06:22.930
But that doesn't stop him
from being many other things as well.


1324
02:06:23.388 --> 02:06:24.930
You know what our Lord said?

1325
02:06:25.097 --> 02:06:28.347
"In my Father's house
are many mansions."


1326
02:06:28.555 --> 02:06:31.138
Contradictory mansions?

1327
02:06:31.763 --> 02:06:37.680
Perhaps, but the contradictions
are mostly in our minds.


1328
02:06:46.747 --> 02:06:49.038
This time I'm leaving for real.

1329
02:06:54.430 --> 02:06:55.847
See you, then.

1330
02:06:56.887 --> 02:06:58.045
"See you."

1331
02:06:58.886 --> 02:07:00.695
It's a figure of speech.

1332
02:07:00.932 --> 02:07:02.765
Yes, we'll see each other again.

1333
02:07:03.372 --> 02:07:04.951
In the other world,

1334
02:07:05.652 --> 02:07:06.913
not this one.

1335
02:07:10.888 --> 02:07:12.390
God bless you.

1336
02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:24.580
