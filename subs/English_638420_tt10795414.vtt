00:00:19.537 --> 00:00:24.959
Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy!
Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy!


4
00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.961
<i>A statue of Lemmy Kilmister</i>

5
00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:30.214
<i>was unveiled last night
at The Rainbow Bar & Grill.</i>


6
00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:35.678
<i>The Los Angeles bar's outdoor
patio has now been dubbed
"Lemmy's Lounge".</i>


7
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.097
I just want to welcome
everybody here.


8
00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:40.975
This is truly
an event from the fans.


9
00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:46.564
Want to thank Mikeal,
the Maglieris here for putting
this on, and honoring Lemmy.


10
00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:47.398
Yeah.

11
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.191
We're here
for a very special night,


12
00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:52.862
we're showing tribute
to one of our dear friends.


13
00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:54.989
Let's open up this statue.

14
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.207
Lemmy!
Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy!


15
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:09.044
Lemmy is always here, and now
Lemmy is permanently here,
not going anywhere.


16
00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:11.839
He's at home here,
and they've enshrined it.


17
00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:15.009
<i>And this to me is going to be,
basically, rock n' roll mecca.</i>


18
00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:18.387
<i>Everybody from rock n' roll's</i>
<i>gotta come here one time</i>
<i>in their life and pay homage.</i>


19
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.224
<i>Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy!</i>

20
00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:24.518
<i>Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy! Lemmy!</i>

21
00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.806
Alright, we are Motörhead.
And we are going
to kick your ass.


22
00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:15.569
<i>It was like a party
every night. It was crazy.</i>


23
00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:18.072
It was absolutely insane, I've
never seen anything like that.


24
00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:20.741
<i>If you were cool, you could
get away with anything.</i>


25
00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:22.910
I used to get away
with murder in there.


26
00:02:22.993 --> 00:02:26.538
<i>I'd see musicians</i>
<i>getting head under the table</i>
<i>and shit like that.</i>


27
00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:28.666
I said do what the fuck
you want, I don't care.


28
00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.501
It was bacchanalia.

29
00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:33.295
It was exactly
how you'd picture it, times ten.


30
00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.922
It was the place to be.

31
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:36.507
It was the rock n' roll café.

32
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.594
I was here every single night
hanging out. All of us were.


33
00:02:40.678 --> 00:02:41.971
You'd see everybody here.

34
00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:43.764
<i>Slash, Ozzy, Lemmy.</i>

35
00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:45.599
<i>- John Bonham.
- Motley Crue.</i>


36
00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:47.184
<i>- Keith Moon.
- Van Halen.</i>


37
00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:48.769
<i>- Jimmy Page.
- Janis Joplin.</i>


38
00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:50.938
- <i>Jimi Hendrix.</i>
- The list goes on and on and on.


39
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:52.481
[Mikeal] <i>It was different then.</i>

40
00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:54.817
<i>There was a culture,
a glamorous culture,</i>


41
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.695
<i>the likes of which
will not happen again.</i>


42
00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:00.614
<i>And the watering hole
of all of it...</i>


43
00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:02.074
<i>The one great hub...</i>

44
00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:03.534
<i>The only rock mecca...</i>

45
00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.829
<i>The church of rock n' roll...
The Rainbow.</i>


46
00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:30.019
<i>The Rainbow</i>
<i>somehow was sort</i>
<i>of when the planets line up.</i>


47
00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.648
<i>A special place
at a special time.</i>


48
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.737
<i>It didn't happen</i>
<i>in the Valley, it didn't</i>
<i>happen on Ventura Boulevard,</i>


49
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.780
<i>it didn't happen
in Iowa or Wyoming.</i>


50
00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:46.160
<i>It happened in Los Angeles.
Perfect weather.</i>


51
00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:49.121
<i>And up the hills,
everybody lived there.</i>


52
00:03:50.122 --> 00:03:52.750
<i>They all came
from all over the world.</i>


53
00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:57.755
<i>And at night they would all
come down and celebrate life.</i>


54
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.884
<i>Anything was possible.</i>

55
00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:26.158
My name is
Mario Maglieri Sr.,


56
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:28.619
<i>and I've been here 42 years.</i>

57
00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:31.205
I've fed more musicians
you can shake a stick at.


58
00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:34.541
<i>My grandpa had
a restaurant back in Chicago.</i>


59
00:04:35.667 --> 00:04:38.837
<i>Know what, I had rock n' roll
in my bar in Chicago</i>


60
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.672
before you ever heard
of rock n' roll.


61
00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:44.343
<i>Lots of people</i>
<i>have been critical</i>
<i>of rock n' roll for a long time,</i>


62
00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:45.844
<i>but if I may say so,</i>

63
00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:49.848
<i>I think for the wrong reason,</i>
<i>because they thought</i>
<i>it was bad music.</i>


64
00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:51.975
<i>Well, actually,
it is worse than that.</i>


65
00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:57.856
<i>As here used it is a cynical,</i>
<i>commercial exploitation</i>
<i>of the emotions of children.</i>


66
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.151
<i>Rock n' roll music
in the United States is dying.</i>


67
00:05:02.945 --> 00:05:05.155
<i>One of his partners
from the restaurant, Elmer,</i>


68
00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:06.740
<i>was gonna open
a business out here.</i>


69
00:05:06.824 --> 00:05:10.869
<i>Elmer Valentine,
he saw the Whisky in France,</i>


70
00:05:10.953 --> 00:05:12.663
and he brought it to America.

71
00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:16.500
<i>He went to Europe,</i>
<i>and in France saw a club</i>
<i>called Whisky A Go Go,</i>


72
00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.545
that had these girls
standing behind the bar
on the ledge dancing.


73
00:05:19.628 --> 00:05:21.964
That's where
he came up with the concept
of the Go-Go girls.


74
00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:26.468
<i>So he opened the club
January 16, 1964.</i>


75
00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:29.680
When I went there about less
than 2 months after it opened,


76
00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:31.783
the guy couldn't run it.
They were robbing him blind.


77
00:05:31.807 --> 00:05:34.852
<i>Elmer had called</i>
<i>my Dad and said "Come in</i>
<i>and straighten this out."</i>


78
00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:38.730
Yeah, I'll come down there.
$200 a week, a lot of money.


79
00:05:38.814 --> 00:05:42.651
My Father came in, to like,
reorganize the business
and run the business.


80
00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:44.319
I fired everyone in the place,

81
00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:47.281
got all new help,
and uh, I straightened it out,


82
00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:49.450
and it became successful
the way it is.


83
00:06:00.461 --> 00:06:04.339
<i>We had I think</i>
<i>three cages of girls</i>
<i>dancing on the stage.</i>


84
00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:08.385
<i>And we had</i>
<i>more movie stars in there</i>
<i>than you could actually count.</i>


85
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.388
Packed house every night.
Was like a hang out.


86
00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:14.183
<i>Here he is with a song
called 'Going to a Go Go',</i>


87
00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:16.393
<i>Smokey Robinson
and the Miracles.</i>


88
00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:30.532
We were the first club
to integrate that we brought
black acts in.


89
00:06:35.204 --> 00:06:38.457
<i>Los Angeles, they didn't
want blacks in the street,</i>


90
00:06:38.582 --> 00:06:41.668
so I fucked 'em all, I brought
'em all for the whole year.


91
00:06:41.752 --> 00:06:44.796
<i>Smokey Robinson, Martha Reeves,
The Temptations, The Tops.</i>


92
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.924
<i>You name 'em, 
I had 'em.</i>

93
00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:51.011
<i>He's color, a human</i>
<i>being, you know, God put us</i>
<i>all here for a reason.</i>


94
00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:52.930
I don't care what color you are.

95
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:57.434
I don't give a shit.

96
00:06:57.518 --> 00:06:59.978
<i>And the visitor
to Hollywood soon discovers</i>


97
00:07:00.062 --> 00:07:04.775
<i>that this small town has</i>
<i>a wealth of entertainment,</i>
<i>but much more.</i>


98
00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:08.028
My Grandpa moved out
to be a manager at first,


99
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:11.406
and you know,
eventually over time started
buying into the business.


100
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.617
<i>His whole family
at that point moved out here.</i>


101
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.494
<i>Everyone, you know,
was living in LA.</i>


102
00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:18.372
I was 16 years
old when I started
at the Whisky A Go Go.


103
00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:23.335
He was a busboy, God,
in the 60's at the Whisky.


104
00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:26.463
<i>I was a kid,
he did not want me there,</i>


105
00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:30.175
and I insisted that he bring me
in there, that I wanted
to come in and work there.


106
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:35.138
I would come in and work,
maybe five, six nights a week,


107
00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:37.349
and I was still going
to High School, then College.


108
00:07:37.432 --> 00:07:39.851
But on my nights off
I wasn't allowed to go in there.


109
00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:42.813
He did not want me
in that environment.


110
00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:45.732
<i>It was an era of peace
and love and free drugs,</i>


111
00:07:45.816 --> 00:07:48.110
<i>and he just didn't want me
to become a part of all that.</i>


112
00:07:48.193 --> 00:07:51.863
<i>He thought I'd fall prey,</i>
<i>so to speak, of what was</i>
<i>going on around me.</i>


113
00:07:51.947 --> 00:07:53.448
I personally had a ball.

114
00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:03.375
<i>My Father ran</i>
<i>the business as far</i>
<i>as the nightclub end of it.</i>


115
00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:04.668
<i>The booking was done by Elmer.</i>

116
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.129
<i>Johnny Rivers
was there for a year.</i>


117
00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:11.383
And then after
rock n' roll started in, then
we started with rock n' roll.


118
00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:13.885
<i>The Doors started
as the house band.</i>


119
00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:16.430
<i>We're paying them
about 50 bucks a week,</i>


120
00:08:16.513 --> 00:08:19.933
a case of beer
a night, whatever,
just to keep 'em entertained.


121
00:08:20.017 --> 00:08:23.103
<i>How The Doors got booked
in the Whisky to begin with</i>


122
00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:25.897
<i>was Chris Gowdy, who worked
in our office as a bookkeeper,</i>


123
00:08:25.981 --> 00:08:28.275
and Charlotte,
who's a ticket taker
at the front door,


124
00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:30.485
<i>went to a club
called The London Fog,</i>


125
00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:33.322
<i>they saw Jim,
and they wanted to screw Jim.</i>


126
00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:35.073
That's why they got hired.

127
00:08:35.157 --> 00:08:38.410
<i>The Doors
opening for Johnny Rivers</i>


128
00:08:39.703 --> 00:08:43.165
and getting
booed off on the stage.


129
00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:58.388
<i>They learned their trade.
They came and rehearsed all day.</i>


130
00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:02.267
<i>That 'Light My Fire' song</i>
<i>that became</i>
<i>12 and a half minutes,</i>


131
00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:04.311
I heard that for two
and a half hours at a time.


132
00:09:04.394 --> 00:09:07.022
By the time it came out
on the radio and became famous,


133
00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:09.232
I was like, "Oh my God,
do I have to hear this again?"


134
00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:15.155
<i>Mother.</i>

135
00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:29.628
<i>Turn it off!
Turn these fucking...!</i>


136
00:09:29.753 --> 00:09:31.713
Actually when I met
Oliver Stone,


137
00:09:31.797 --> 00:09:33.941
this was years later, after he
did the movie 'The Doors",


138
00:09:33.965 --> 00:09:35.634
<i>I had to correct him.</i>

139
00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:37.260
Hey, come on, man!

140
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.264
Here's your act right there.

141
00:09:42.057 --> 00:09:44.351
<i>My Father did not throw Jim out.</i>

142
00:09:44.434 --> 00:09:47.145
Jim had a habit of like
kinda dropping his pants.


143
00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:50.524
<i>Now I know today, they wear
their pants below their ass,</i>


144
00:09:50.607 --> 00:09:52.359
in those days
you didn't do that.


145
00:09:52.442 --> 00:09:54.861
The girls would go crazy
in the audience.


146
00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:56.738
And one night in particular,

147
00:09:56.822 --> 00:09:59.116
and this is where the movie
got it misinterpreted,


148
00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:02.160
<i>is he decided
to do a frontal nudity,</i>


149
00:10:02.244 --> 00:10:04.538
<i>and kind of showed
his works onstage.</i>


150
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:08.166
My Father got so ticked off
that he pulled the plug.


151
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.210
<i>Jim jumped off the stage
onto the dance floor,</i>


152
00:10:10.293 --> 00:10:13.630
went down the steps
of the dance floor, went up
on the second landing,


153
00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:15.507
and peed over the balcony.

154
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.010
Literally like,
to say screw you back
to my Dad for unplugging him.


155
00:10:19.094 --> 00:10:20.971
Went up
in the dressing room and hid,


156
00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:23.491
and at two
in the morning he came down
and apologized to my Dad


157
00:10:23.515 --> 00:10:25.976
and they were
back onstage the next night.


158
00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.644
<i>Jim Morrison
used too many drugs.</i>


159
00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:30.605
He was not a bad kid,
he was a good kid.


160
00:10:30.689 --> 00:10:33.567
Like I'd tell him "Hey,"
you know I called 'em names,


161
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.527
"You get out
on that stage at 9 o'clock,


162
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.905
not 5, not 5 after, you're not
I'll beat the shit outta ya."


163
00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:48.457
The Whisky was the place
where the happening acts
were happening.


164
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:53.044
<i>If you come out
to LA as a band,</i>

165
00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:54.671
you really
want that on your resume,


166
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:57.355
that you've played
at the Whisky A Go Go, I mean,
it's a big thing.


167
00:10:58.341 --> 00:11:01.720
<i>My Dad was 17, 18 years old
working in these clubs,</i>


168
00:11:01.803 --> 00:11:04.806
<i>and it's mind-blowing</i>
<i>the people he had</i>
<i>to have come across.</i>


169
00:11:06.183 --> 00:11:09.019
At the time you're not aware
of what's going on around you,


170
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:12.731
you know, I'm hanging out
with Jimi Hendrix
and Arthur Lee from Love.


171
00:11:12.814 --> 00:11:14.733
<i>I mean, just
to be sitting at the Whisky</i>


172
00:11:14.858 --> 00:11:17.861
<i>and have someone from</i>
<i>The Beatles or have Andy Warhol</i>
<i>sitting in there,</i>


173
00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:19.946
I mean that's just,
it's unbelievable.


174
00:11:21.364 --> 00:11:24.242
<i>And I was the busboy
for probably six, eight months</i>


175
00:11:24.326 --> 00:11:27.204
and then I was the manager
when my Dad wanted
to take a night off.


176
00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:31.208
<i>I worked into bartending.</i>
<i>I learned the business</i>
<i>from the ground up.</i>


177
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:34.044
Out of College, Law School,
everything else I did,


178
00:11:34.127 --> 00:11:36.755
the best education I had
was right here
on the Sunset Strip.


179
00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:50.185
<i>Janis Joplin came in,</i>
<i>and her name's</i>
<i>Pearl by the way,</i>


180
00:11:50.268 --> 00:11:51.686
<i>Janis was her stage name.</i>

181
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.898
And she sat down in the middle
booth of the Whisky,


182
00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:59.194
<i>she had like four glasses</i>
<i>of Southern Comfort</i>
<i>on the rocks,</i>


183
00:11:59.277 --> 00:12:01.112
and on or about her fourth one,

184
00:12:01.196 --> 00:12:05.534
my Dad said put
a case of Southern Comfort
into Pearls trunk.


185
00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:07.786
<i>She leaves with her manager,</i>

186
00:12:07.869 --> 00:12:12.958
the next morning on the news
they said that Janis Joplin had
died of alcohol poisoning.


187
00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:16.127
<i>I thought, well,</i>
<i>the booze I gave her,</i>
<i>I must've killed her.</i>


188
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:18.171
<i>She had all those drinks,
and I mean, I was a kid.</i>


189
00:12:18.255 --> 00:12:20.590
So for like three days,
I thought I killed her


190
00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:24.344
until the coroner's report came
out and found out
she actually OD-ed,


191
00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:25.887
and no, I did not
kill Janis Joplin.


192
00:12:25.971 --> 00:12:28.557
<i>And here's</i>
<i>the world famous</i>
<i>Whisky A Go Go on the Strip,</i>


193
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.519
<i>a favorite dancing spot for both</i>
<i>the mods and movie stars</i>
<i>who want to get it on.</i>


194
00:12:32.602 --> 00:12:35.021
<i>Let's drop in and see
what's happening tonight.</i>


195
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:43.071
<i>The Whisky was pretty essential,</i>

196
00:12:43.154 --> 00:12:46.908
it was one
of the first great
rock n' roll clubs.


197
00:12:46.992 --> 00:12:51.329
<i>It's the Old Marquis</i>
<i>in London, it's the CBGB</i>
<i>of the West Coast,</i>


198
00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:54.541
it's the place that you know
everybody's gone through.


199
00:12:58.545 --> 00:13:01.089
You thought it was
this big, massive concert hall,


200
00:13:01.172 --> 00:13:04.551
you can't fit more
than 200 people inside.


201
00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:09.556
<i>It was just a regular bar</i>
<i>with people, and yet anybody</i>
<i>who's anybody played there.</i>


202
00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:12.350
<i>A lot of great artists
over the years, Led Zeppelin.</i>


203
00:13:12.434 --> 00:13:14.477
<i>Buffalo Springfield
is another big band,</i>


204
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:16.062
Fleetwood Mac
is another big band,


205
00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:18.857
Alice Cooper,
you know, all these bands
when they were nothing.


206
00:13:18.982 --> 00:13:22.027
When you first start out,
and before you figure out
your game,


207
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.528
The Whisky's the place to do it.

208
00:13:23.612 --> 00:13:27.157
I cannot tell you how many
thousands of people got
started on this street.


209
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.370
<i>Everybody, they've all</i>
<i>done their first tour</i>
<i>through the States in clubs,</i>


210
00:13:32.454 --> 00:13:34.873
<i>so they ended up
at the Whisky in LA.</i>


211
00:13:34.956 --> 00:13:37.959
The first time we ever
played in Los Angeles
was at the Whisky,


212
00:13:38.043 --> 00:13:41.338
and there was like a line
around the block twice.


213
00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:44.883
<i>We had opening nights</i>
<i>probably two to three times</i>
<i>a week with major groups,</i>


214
00:13:45.008 --> 00:13:49.054
<i>and then you always had</i>
<i>the house band, Chicago,</i>
<i>CTA at that time.</i>


215
00:13:50.722 --> 00:13:52.515
<i>They were, like,
I think seven guys</i>


216
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:55.185
<i>living in</i>
<i>a one bedroom apartment</i>
<i>on the Hollywood Boulevard.</i>


217
00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:59.606
We didn't have
much of anything. I mean
we're just trying to survive.


218
00:13:59.689 --> 00:14:05.445
We all lived together
in a little house
on Holly Drive under the 101


219
00:14:05.528 --> 00:14:08.073
and, you know,
coming to the Whiskey to work


220
00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:12.035
was a chance to make
some dough to feed ourselves


221
00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:16.665
and to possibly get, you know,

222
00:14:16.748 --> 00:14:18.667
a connection
to something even better.


223
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.628
<i>We were opening
for Velvet Underground,</i>


224
00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:24.047
they were promoting
their very famous first album


225
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.716
with the Andy Warhol
banana on the cover.


226
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.928
And not only did we,
sort of, become the house band,


227
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:33.807
that would be on the off nights,
not the nights when...


228
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.434
- Like the big names.
- The big names
would come through.


229
00:14:36.518 --> 00:14:40.480
But we did get access
to the club during the daytime.


230
00:14:40.563 --> 00:14:44.651
We were in here rehearsing
that was to become
Chicago Transit Authority,


231
00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:45.735
the first album.

232
00:14:49.614 --> 00:14:51.658
<i>This was a sounding ground,</i>

233
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:56.496
and a place for us to really
write and arrange the music


234
00:14:56.579 --> 00:14:58.623
that put us on the map.

235
00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:08.550
Next thing you know, we had
record company executives
in here


236
00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:10.760
and bidding wars were starting.

237
00:15:10.844 --> 00:15:15.598
And so we wound up acing a deal
with Columbia Records,


238
00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:19.185
which started here.

239
00:15:26.276 --> 00:15:28.153
<i>West Hollywood's
a popular part of LA,</i>


240
00:15:28.236 --> 00:15:30.155
<i>you know obviously
you had Tower Records there,</i>


241
00:15:30.238 --> 00:15:32.115
<i>you had a lot
of nightclubs around there,</i>


242
00:15:32.198 --> 00:15:34.200
<i>and it just had cemented itself</i>

243
00:15:34.284 --> 00:15:37.412
even before the Whisky
as being sort
of the entertainment strip.


244
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.834
You know, this is the Whisky
on the Sunset Strip
in Hollywood.


245
00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:47.130
Palm trees, suntan chicks,
and it was just, it was cool.


246
00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:51.176
Sunset Blvd was packed
with people strolling,


247
00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:53.344
you know, it was like
a party on the sidewalk.


248
00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:58.183
Going to a concert
was an event, it was
the gathering of the tribes,


249
00:15:58.266 --> 00:16:02.562
and the streets were just
filled with really interesting,


250
00:16:02.645 --> 00:16:04.731
attractive, glamorous people.

251
00:16:04.814 --> 00:16:08.943
And you'd just hop
from one club
to the next, you know,


252
00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:12.614
passing joints and just,
"Hey brother, what's happening?"


253
00:16:12.697 --> 00:16:16.576
You'd walk
up the street and people
would hand you a hit of acid.


254
00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:18.536
<i>Every night there
was people on the street,</i>


255
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.538
the street
was full of young people.


256
00:16:20.622 --> 00:16:25.001
<i>Just strolling</i>
<i>up and down the street</i>
<i>you would meet movie stars,</i>


257
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.087
<i>rock stars, everyone.</i>

258
00:16:29.047 --> 00:16:34.177
<i>A wandering band of members</i>
<i>of a so-called religious cult</i>
<i>with a leader they call Jesus</i>


259
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.930
<i>has had three
of its followers arrested</i>


260
00:16:37.013 --> 00:16:41.059
<i>in the investigation</i>
<i>of the murder of Sharon Tate</i>
<i>and six others.</i>


261
00:16:41.184 --> 00:16:43.061
<i>Charles Manson.</i>

262
00:16:43.186 --> 00:16:46.439
<i>The girl called me at home</i>
<i>and said there's</i>
<i>a guy downstairs,</i>


263
00:16:46.523 --> 00:16:48.733
<i>we're closed, he won't get up.</i>

264
00:16:48.817 --> 00:16:52.779
So I'll be right down there,
so I drove down all the way
to the Whisky,


265
00:16:52.862 --> 00:16:55.740
and I go downstairs and said
"What are you doing here?"


266
00:16:55.824 --> 00:16:57.367
He said "You know who I am?"

267
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.246
I stopped him,
"I don't give a fuck
who you are, okay?"


268
00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:05.333
"Now you
gotta leave or you don't,
I'm gonna kick your ass."


269
00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:06.668
<i>He says "I'm Jesus."</i>

270
00:17:06.751 --> 00:17:10.672
I tell him
"I'm God, motherfucker,
now get up from that chair."


271
00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:15.218
He got up, or I'd of had to beat
the shit out of him. Either one.


272
00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:19.013
<i>The Whisky was a club</i>
<i>where groups came to see</i>
<i>other groups play.</i>


273
00:17:20.223 --> 00:17:21.599
<i>That was a change in time,</i>

274
00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:24.519
<i>and if you give credit</i>
<i>to an individual,</i>
<i>it'd be my Dad.</i>


275
00:17:26.062 --> 00:17:28.940
<i>He literally came out</i>
<i>and stood at the front door</i>
<i>of The Rainbow,</i>


276
00:17:29.023 --> 00:17:31.317
<i>so the groups started
coming in here to hang out.</i>


277
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:33.041
<i>The Rainbow was
originally the Villa Nova,</i>


278
00:17:33.111 --> 00:17:34.821
<i>which was
a famous restaurant in itself.</i>


279
00:17:34.904 --> 00:17:39.117
<i>I was here</i>
<i>with my parents when it</i>
<i>was Villa Nova in the 50's.</i>


280
00:17:39.242 --> 00:17:41.578
<i>It was loaded with movie stars.</i>

281
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:45.540
Marilyn Monroe dated
Joe Dimaggio in that booth
right behind us.


282
00:17:45.623 --> 00:17:47.625
<i>I was friends with Tony Curtis.</i>

283
00:17:47.709 --> 00:17:50.837
<i>I believe it was around the time</i>
<i>that they were making</i>
<i>'Some Like It Hot',</i>


284
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.883
that Marilyn Monroe
and Tony Curtis would
meet here at The Rainbow,


285
00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:57.886
then called the Villa Nova,
and have their little liaisons,


286
00:17:57.969 --> 00:18:00.930
<i>and then went out</i>
<i>to the bungalows</i>
<i>up by the ocean.</i>


287
00:18:01.723 --> 00:18:04.434
She was cheating
on Arthur Miller,
her playwright husband.


288
00:18:04.517 --> 00:18:06.978
<i>Arthur Miller found out,
and wanted to fight with him.</i>


289
00:18:07.061 --> 00:18:09.772
<i>And then it was</i>
<i>either the director</i>
<i>of 'Some Like It Hot'</i>


290
00:18:09.856 --> 00:18:12.942
broke it up, or Arthur Miller
decided it wasn't worth
fighting with him.


291
00:18:13.026 --> 00:18:16.154
Tony promised
to stop the relationship
with Marilyn Monroe,


292
00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:18.797
<i>and they all agreed</i>
<i>and shook hands, and that was</i>
<i>the end of that.</i>


293
00:18:23.077 --> 00:18:26.164
<i>The Whisky was a place</i>
<i>where groups came</i>
<i>to see other groups.</i>


294
00:18:26.247 --> 00:18:30.001
Now the groups were coming
up to The Rainbow to hang out,
to hang with one another.


295
00:18:33.463 --> 00:18:36.633
<i>We had a private club upstairs
called The Vampires Lair.</i>


296
00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:40.470
The Hollywood Vampires,
it was a club of people
that just all hung together.


297
00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:42.889
<i>It was Micky Dolenz,
and Alice Cooper.</i>


298
00:18:42.972 --> 00:18:47.852
<i>You had Ringo,</i>
<i>John Lennon, these people</i>
<i>hung in here all the time.</i>


299
00:18:47.936 --> 00:18:51.356
The Hollywood Vampires were me,

300
00:18:51.439 --> 00:18:57.153
<i>Alice, Harry, Keith, and John,
that was kind of the core.</i>


301
00:18:57.237 --> 00:19:03.076
So they were hanging
out up there, and then...
Oh, I can't look.


302
00:19:04.035 --> 00:19:09.332
<i>Shortly after</i>
<i>it opened, we were kind</i>
<i>of a drinking men's club,</i>


303
00:19:09.415 --> 00:19:14.254
like you would have in England,
you know, call it
the Priars or something.


304
00:19:18.258 --> 00:19:20.843
I think maybe it might have had
something to do with the fact


305
00:19:20.927 --> 00:19:24.430
that this had such a cool, like
private, private, private...


306
00:19:24.514 --> 00:19:27.517
<i>You know, it was tough enough
to get downstairs,</i>


307
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.355
<i>you know, and then to get up</i>
<i>here, over The Rainbow was</i>
<i>like another level,</i>


308
00:19:32.438 --> 00:19:35.441
and then to get up here was
basically impossible


309
00:19:35.525 --> 00:19:38.653
unless you were
one of those guys.


310
00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:51.457
Every kind of act
you could imagine,


311
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.252
every kind of drug
you could imagine,
probably went through there,


312
00:19:54.335 --> 00:19:56.254
I'm not going
to point fingers at anyone.


313
00:19:56.379 --> 00:20:00.675
We were
just smoking and drinking
and laughing and puking.


314
00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:04.762
<i>There probably wasn't a whole</i>
<i>lot of people that even</i>
<i>wanted to go up there.</i>


315
00:20:04.846 --> 00:20:06.764
<i>It's like all those weirdoes.</i>

316
00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:13.062
<i>Contrary to a little bit
of urban myth,</i>


317
00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:18.860
<i>Alice and I,</i>
<i>we were into sports,</i>
<i>Harry was a basketball player.</i>


318
00:20:18.943 --> 00:20:23.281
<i>And Alice's idea was
to start a softball team</i>


319
00:20:23.406 --> 00:20:25.199
<i>called the Hollywood Vampires.</i>

320
00:20:30.913 --> 00:20:35.585
He got t-shirts made and we
would play these charity games,


321
00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:40.298
and we'd go out and raise money
and stuff, then we'd
come here and get hammered.


322
00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:52.060
<i>But The Rainbow is just
a great restaurant,</i>


323
00:20:52.143 --> 00:20:55.313
<i>and it got to the point
where it was probably</i>


324
00:20:55.438 --> 00:20:59.484
one of the premiere rock places
along the Sunset Strip.


325
00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:03.154
<i>The Rainbow became the home
of the moving stars,</i>


326
00:21:03.237 --> 00:21:08.034
<i>where rock stars and musicians</i>
<i>and the movie stars came</i>
<i>to see one another.</i>


327
00:21:08.117 --> 00:21:10.828
<i>Literally to be seen
or to see who's here.</i>


328
00:21:11.662 --> 00:21:14.207
It was more than instantaneous,
it was kind of unbelievable.


329
00:21:21.672 --> 00:21:25.760
[Gene]<i>Anybody who was in town,</i>
<i>whether they were</i>
<i>recording or playing a show</i>


330
00:21:25.843 --> 00:21:26.636
<i>would come here.</i>

331
00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:30.515
<i>This was the hub.
Main acts would come to LA,</i>


332
00:21:30.598 --> 00:21:33.101
they'd come here
on a night off to see
what was going on.


333
00:21:33.184 --> 00:21:36.729
Bands who were
actually the innovators
of all, of all music.


334
00:21:39.482 --> 00:21:41.651
[James] <i>The Who, or The Stones.</i>

335
00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:43.653
Well, I met 'em all.
I talked to them.


336
00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:45.279
Give 'em booze,
whatever they want.


337
00:21:45.363 --> 00:21:48.282
<i>Was it James Brown wouldn't go
in any other restroom but here?</i>


338
00:21:48.366 --> 00:21:50.535
<i>You'd never know
who you were gonna see.</i>


339
00:21:50.618 --> 00:21:52.495
<i>Zeppelin would come in
all the time,</i>


340
00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:56.040
<i>they'd put the big</i>
<i>round table in the middle,</i>
<i>all of Zeppelin were there.</i>


341
00:21:56.124 --> 00:21:59.919
Deep Purple would come in,
The Who, and it was packed,


342
00:22:00.002 --> 00:22:04.006
it was absolutely packed, and it
was really a fun different era.


343
00:22:11.264 --> 00:22:14.267
<i>And it's really
a restaurant in a club.</i>


344
00:22:15.977 --> 00:22:18.438
I have a lot
of memories of that kitchen.


345
00:22:19.689 --> 00:22:21.566
<i>So busy, all the time.</i>

346
00:22:23.401 --> 00:22:26.946
Always having something to eat,
even if you had no money,
I mean he would...


347
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:28.906
Mario was always,

348
00:22:30.408 --> 00:22:35.413
"Eh, pay me later, you know,
whatever, I didn't
hear anything."


349
00:22:40.418 --> 00:22:44.213
It's not just the location
of it, because it's right
in the middle of everything,


350
00:22:44.297 --> 00:22:45.673
but the food's really good.

351
00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:49.969
<i>They have the best</i>
<i>damn soups, the pizzas</i>
<i>are notorious,</i>


352
00:22:50.052 --> 00:22:54.682
I always tell my friends
you get a Spago steak
at a Rainbow price.


353
00:22:54.765 --> 00:22:57.894
<i>The steak, you gotta
pay 60, 70 dollars for a steak,</i>


354
00:22:57.977 --> 00:23:00.104
I've got the best steak
in this city right here.


355
00:23:00.188 --> 00:23:03.399
<i>You feel sick, you gotta
eat some Rainbow chicken soup.</i>


356
00:23:03.483 --> 00:23:05.610
It's the only way
to cure your throat.


357
00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:10.448
My name is Miguel Murillo,
and I'm the chef at The Rainbow.


358
00:23:10.531 --> 00:23:15.786
Miguel is a mainstay,
without a doubt, he makes
sure this place runs right.


359
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:21.459
<i>I started
working here April 1972,</i>


360
00:23:21.542 --> 00:23:24.086
started as a busboy,
I'd never cooked before.


361
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.422
He used to clean toilets,
now he's the chef.


362
00:23:26.506 --> 00:23:30.551
<i>Miguel did the movie</i>
Up In Smoke<i>, Cheech and Chong</i>
<i>used to hang in here.</i>


363
00:23:30.635 --> 00:23:33.429
<i>In fact, Cheech married
one of our waitresses.</i>


364
00:23:33.513 --> 00:23:36.307
<i>We smoked</i>
<i>this whole lid, man, and I</i>
<i>haven't even had a buzz yet.</i>


365
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.809
<i>We had a French chef</i>
<i>that we first opened</i>
<i>The Rainbow with</i>


366
00:23:38.893 --> 00:23:42.230
<i>and Miguel
watched him prepare the food,</i>


367
00:23:42.313 --> 00:23:45.608
<i>and then with my mother's
recipes he incorporated into it</i>


368
00:23:45.691 --> 00:23:47.318
<i>and developed the menu we have.</i>

369
00:23:47.401 --> 00:23:49.695
The consistency is unbelievable,

370
00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:52.073
since I was a kid it tastes
exactly the same.


371
00:23:52.156 --> 00:23:53.908
<i>Miguel's been here 43 years,</i>

372
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:57.995
<i>we have not one or two, but many
long, long time employees.</i>


373
00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:00.957
It's not unusual for someone
to be here 25, 30 years.


374
00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:04.001
<i>The same chef and the same owner</i>

375
00:24:04.085 --> 00:24:07.129
<i>have been around for about 30,
at least 30 some odd years.</i>


376
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.133
It was like, you know,
go in the kitchen.
It was like your house.


377
00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:13.594
<i>I remember being there</i>
<i>as a little kid</i>
<i>running around,</i>


378
00:24:13.678 --> 00:24:16.514
my whole childhood
my Grandfather
would work late nights


379
00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:19.517
until three in the morning
every night, my Dad same thing.


380
00:24:19.642 --> 00:24:23.020
As kids we didn't go to bed
until two, three in the morning,


381
00:24:23.104 --> 00:24:24.915
because it was just
what our family was used to.


382
00:24:24.939 --> 00:24:29.026
I made it a family, I want
my family. What else you got
in life? Nothing.


383
00:24:32.071 --> 00:24:34.156
<i>I took care
of my people that came in,</i>


384
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.118
<i>"Hello, how are ya, how's your
kids, how's your wife?"</i>


385
00:24:39.537 --> 00:24:41.372
<i>It's like that TV show</i> Cheers,

386
00:24:41.455 --> 00:24:43.583
people like to go where
everybody knows your name.


387
00:24:49.338 --> 00:24:52.091
<i>And to this day,
we are now 43 years later,</i>


388
00:24:52.174 --> 00:24:54.385
<i>and they are still
coming here on a regular basis.</i>


389
00:24:54.468 --> 00:24:57.638
You can come on
a Monday or Tuesday, which
you wouldn't even expect it,


390
00:24:57.722 --> 00:25:00.099
<i>and you may have
five or ten rock stars.</i>


391
00:25:00.182 --> 00:25:02.518
<i>Ozzy's here
about three, four times a week.</i>


392
00:25:02.602 --> 00:25:06.731
Lemmy from Motörhead bought
a place right down the street
so he would be near The Rainbow.


393
00:25:06.814 --> 00:25:09.191
He makes no bones about it,
he has to be by The Rainbow.


394
00:25:17.658 --> 00:25:21.287
Lemmy is a God. Lemmy is
awesome, he's always
been a part of this club,


395
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.457
<i>he loves</i>
<i>hanging out at The Rainbow.</i>
<i>He's always at The Rainbow.</i>


396
00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.542
He's like furniture there,
he's always there.


397
00:25:26.626 --> 00:25:29.211
<i>People call and they
think he owns the place,</i>


398
00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:32.381
you know, I get all these calls,
what does Lemmy have
to do with The Rainbow,


399
00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:33.799
<i>it's like
he just hangs out there.</i>


400
00:25:33.883 --> 00:25:36.093
Lemmy, he still comes here.

401
00:25:36.177 --> 00:25:38.846
<i>Plays the machine on the bar,
that's all he does.</i>


402
00:25:38.929 --> 00:25:41.182
But he minds his own business,
such a nice guy.


403
00:25:41.265 --> 00:25:45.102
<i>He's in front</i>
<i>of the machine all the time,</i>
<i>drinking his jack and cokes,</i>


404
00:25:45.186 --> 00:25:47.605
and uh, you don't bug him.

405
00:25:47.688 --> 00:25:50.358
<i>One of the coolest
things about The Rainbow</i>


406
00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:53.569
<i>is celebrities like to hang</i>
<i>out there cause they don't</i>
<i>get messed with.</i>


407
00:25:53.653 --> 00:25:57.073
<i>People who are</i>
<i>famous can hang there</i>
<i>and kind of sit in a corner</i>


408
00:25:57.156 --> 00:26:00.451
and keep to themselves,
and not get fucked with
by every person that walks by.


409
00:26:50.793 --> 00:26:54.588
That guy helped me out in Vegas
one time with another joint
we had there,


410
00:26:54.672 --> 00:26:58.050
and Lemmy's a good man.

411
00:26:58.134 --> 00:27:01.387
<i>He's an amazing guy,</i>
<i>he's a great person,</i>
<i>and we all adore him.</i>


412
00:27:27.538 --> 00:27:29.415
<i>It was the kind
of crowd that I liked.</i>


413
00:27:29.498 --> 00:27:32.626
I wasn't really crazy
about like the Sky Bar,
or the W.


414
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.004
These places
struck me as a bit pretentious,


415
00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:38.799
you know, leisure suit attitude,
you know sports jackets,
it's just, I don't know.


416
00:27:38.883 --> 00:27:41.761
This is rock n' roll. This is
as rock n' roll as it gets.


417
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.900
<i>A rock star is a peculiar thing,</i>

418
00:27:55.983 --> 00:27:58.527
<i>it's come to mean
you're extraordinary.</i>


419
00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:01.113
You can be Bill Clinton,
you're a rock star,


420
00:28:01.197 --> 00:28:04.533
<i>or Obama, or whoever
it is you think is cool.</i>


421
00:28:04.617 --> 00:28:07.203
You can't say,
"See that guy over there,
he's a hip-hop star,"


422
00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:08.621
it fucking means nothing.

423
00:28:08.704 --> 00:28:10.664
"That guy over there,
he's a country star."


424
00:28:10.748 --> 00:28:14.835
<i>Take your pick, "That guy's</i>
<i>a heavy metal star,"</i>
<i>it means fuck all.</i>


425
00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:20.049
There is only rock, because
as much as we love Sinatra,
and the Rat Pack,


426
00:28:20.132 --> 00:28:21.342
<i>it's not this thing.</i>

427
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:25.679
<i>Mom and Dad</i>
<i>and outside culture</i>
<i>didn't effect it,</i>


428
00:28:25.763 --> 00:28:29.767
<i>so peoples</i>
<i>hair grew longer, they wore</i>
<i>more flamboyant clothes.</i>


429
00:28:29.892 --> 00:28:33.854
<i>Straight guys like Robert Plant
were wearing chick clothing,</i>


430
00:28:33.938 --> 00:28:38.192
<i>and the sort of ambiguous</i>
<i>nature of guys moving</i>
<i>like girls, and stuff.</i>


431
00:28:38.275 --> 00:28:42.780
<i>It was not judgment,</i>
<i>in fact, I don't remember</i>
<i>the word gay being uttered.</i>


432
00:28:42.863 --> 00:28:44.615
You just did whatever you
wanted to do.


433
00:28:45.616 --> 00:28:48.702
<i>When people</i>
<i>say tell us a story,</i>
<i>it doesn't have to be sexual,</i>


434
00:28:48.786 --> 00:28:52.122
if it's rock n' roll,
it's always about sexual.


435
00:28:52.206 --> 00:28:56.752
If it's country music it's
about your beer and your truck
or your hog or whatever.


436
00:28:56.836 --> 00:28:59.588
<i>That's why we picked up guitars
in the first place.</i>


437
00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:02.800
<i>What do you think, we have</i>
<i>some great secret to impart</i>
<i>to the world?</i>


438
00:29:02.883 --> 00:29:06.554
<i>I don't look like Bob Dylan,
nobody pretends to be that.</i>


439
00:29:06.637 --> 00:29:07.721
We just wanted to get laid.

440
00:29:07.805 --> 00:29:11.767
<i>The Rainbow</i>
<i>was really a place</i>
<i>where rock n' roll musicians</i>


441
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:14.687
<i>could go and hang out,
and just be themselves,</i>


442
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.189
<i>and be able to you know,
have a good time.</i>


443
00:29:17.273 --> 00:29:19.167
The kind of good time
that a musician wants to have.


444
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:23.362
You know, the reputation was
rock n' roll... sex, drugs
and rock n' roll.


445
00:29:24.363 --> 00:29:28.325
<i>People want to live</i>
<i>a kind of a rock n' roll</i>
<i>gypsy lifestyle</i>


446
00:29:28.409 --> 00:29:30.327
<i>where you don't have
to apologize.</i>


447
00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:34.123
<i>There was
even a magazine called Star,</i>


448
00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:37.334
<i>and on the cover of every
issue of star were groupies</i>


449
00:29:37.418 --> 00:29:40.462
<i>who would tell their stories
of bedding down Robert Plant,</i>


450
00:29:40.546 --> 00:29:44.216
<i>or the Aerosmith guys,</i>
<i>or whoever.</i>
<i>They were celebrated.</i>


451
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.055
We get to fuck
the prettiest boys, you get
to smoke the best dope.


452
00:29:50.139 --> 00:29:53.475
You get to meet all
the most far out people.
It's magic.


453
00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:04.778
You just had to be cool
about it. That was the sort
of fine line.


454
00:30:20.252 --> 00:30:24.256
<i>Once I finally got out
of high school in 1978</i>


455
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.843
<i>my first thing to do</i>
<i>was to pack up the car</i>
<i>and come to Hollywood.</i>


456
00:30:30.888 --> 00:30:34.350
<i>It was in the heart
of the disco era,</i>


457
00:30:34.433 --> 00:30:37.519
<i>rock was a secondary thing.</i>

458
00:30:38.646 --> 00:30:42.858
The very first night I came out
in '77 I came to The Rainbow,


459
00:30:42.942 --> 00:30:46.904
and then I came every night
after that for years.


460
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.159
<i>There were all these guys</i>
<i>waiting for a chance,</i>
<i>going through different bands.</i>


461
00:30:53.744 --> 00:30:57.581
<i>I'm talking about me
and Nikki Sixx, Blackie Lawless</i>


462
00:30:57.665 --> 00:31:00.542
and we were all hanging
here wondering what was
going to happen to us.


463
00:31:09.343 --> 00:31:11.303
<i>I was an aspiring
rock n' roll musician</i>


464
00:31:11.387 --> 00:31:14.473
<i>and hanging out at all
the various clubs in LA,</i>


465
00:31:14.556 --> 00:31:19.186
<i>you know, sort of doing</i>
<i>that thing that you do which is</i>
<i>going to check out bands,</i>


466
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:21.271
going to sort of network
so to speak.


467
00:31:29.071 --> 00:31:31.699
<i>I mean all kinds
of interesting stories</i>


468
00:31:31.782 --> 00:31:34.201
about things that have developed
at The Rainbow,


469
00:31:34.284 --> 00:31:38.163
<i>from record deals</i>
<i>to songs, to bands,</i>
<i>members of bands meeting,</i>


470
00:31:38.247 --> 00:31:41.000
<i>I mean all kinds of, you name
it, it's happened there.</i>


471
00:31:48.424 --> 00:31:51.677
Rock music
in the 80's all came out
of The Rainbow and The Whisky.


472
00:31:58.267 --> 00:32:02.980
I was a stalwart at The Rainbow.
I have a long history
with Mikeal and Mario.


473
00:32:03.063 --> 00:32:06.275
<i>I first met them
unbeknownst to them</i>


474
00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:09.653
probably when I was like 15.

475
00:32:09.737 --> 00:32:14.074
<i>I used to make</i>
<i>fake IDs and we'd go</i>
<i>in there on the weekends.</i>


476
00:32:14.158 --> 00:32:16.660
Mikeal was always
hanging around the door.


477
00:32:16.744 --> 00:32:19.121
He finally busted me
with my fake ID


478
00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:21.540
<i>and I'd gone down
there with Steven</i>


479
00:32:21.623 --> 00:32:24.376
<i>and he was using
the fake ID I made for him.</i>


480
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.670
<i>He walked right in,
and I got held up.</i>


481
00:32:26.754 --> 00:32:30.632
<i>I was drunk too,</i>
<i>and I was pissed,</i>
<i>so I went back to my pad,</i>


482
00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:34.970
and I went
into my Mom's clothes,


483
00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:37.264
cause it was Tuesday,
it was ladies night.


484
00:32:37.347 --> 00:32:39.475
So I went through
a bunch of her shit


485
00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:43.145
and I put together
this makeshift female
sort of get up,


486
00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:46.273
and some make-up and that,
and I padded my chest up


487
00:32:46.356 --> 00:32:49.026
and did the whole nine
and went back
up there and got in.


488
00:32:49.151 --> 00:32:52.446
<i>But then suddenly I
realized the grim reality</i>


489
00:32:52.529 --> 00:32:56.408
is that I'm dressed
as a girl in The Rainbow.
It did work though. I got in.


490
00:32:58.452 --> 00:33:01.205
<i>Well, I would</i>
<i>probably be breaking</i>
<i>the law by saying</i>


491
00:33:01.288 --> 00:33:03.040
<i>the first time
I was let in here.</i>


492
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.711
As a musician you could live
on a bowl of chicken soup
and a loaf of bread


493
00:33:07.795 --> 00:33:09.713
because they always gave you
a loaf of bread,


494
00:33:09.797 --> 00:33:12.257
which was like the thing
you fill up on


495
00:33:12.341 --> 00:33:14.885
but then you get a little bit
of nourishment with it.


496
00:33:14.968 --> 00:33:16.637
It was a big bowl too.

497
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.557
There's so many that literally
give credit to my Dad


498
00:33:20.641 --> 00:33:24.561
<i>because yeah, he supported
them while they were coming up.</i>


499
00:33:24.645 --> 00:33:26.188
<i>And he always
took them under his wing.</i>


500
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:29.000
If someone came in
and it looked like they were
down and out on their luck,


501
00:33:29.024 --> 00:33:32.402
or trying to get started,
my Dad was always like,
here, gotta feed you.


502
00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:33.737
Have a bowl of soup.

503
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:36.073
<i>I met Mario
in The Runaways days,</i>


504
00:33:36.156 --> 00:33:40.285
we had an apartment
around the corner
up here on Clarke street.


505
00:33:40.369 --> 00:33:43.080
And we would come
to The Rainbow every night


506
00:33:43.163 --> 00:33:46.792
and Mario would take care of us
every night 'cause
we didn't have any money.


507
00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:49.378
<i>You know, in those days I might
have had enough for a beer.</i>


508
00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:51.505
<i>Mario was always very,
very cool about it.</i>


509
00:33:51.588 --> 00:33:55.342
He'd hook me up with the next,
maybe, even a refill.


510
00:33:56.802 --> 00:33:59.429
You know, I don't know
why he was so sweet
to me but he was.


511
00:33:59.513 --> 00:34:02.099
And to this day
I always thank him for it.


512
00:34:02.182 --> 00:34:07.938
<i>Mario really gave us a place
to put a roof over our heads.</i>


513
00:34:08.021 --> 00:34:11.441
We were trying
to be rock stars, learning,


514
00:34:11.525 --> 00:34:15.779
and reaching out for different
people to help us,
and Mario was there.


515
00:34:18.031 --> 00:34:21.535
The Runaways had the largest
attendance record


516
00:34:21.618 --> 00:34:24.955
in the history
of the Whisky a Go Go


517
00:34:25.038 --> 00:34:28.417
<i>that wrapped around The Rainbow
four nights in a row.</i>


518
00:34:48.103 --> 00:34:51.440
<i>Your Grandpa let me</i>
<i>in there, he'd buy me a meal,</i>
<i>I didn't have any money.</i>


519
00:34:51.523 --> 00:34:55.110
I've seriously heard
that story from a thousand
different people.


520
00:34:55.194 --> 00:34:56.737
It's me, it's my nature.

521
00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.697
I feel sorry
for the guy down there,


522
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.324
not the guy up,
but the guy down here.


523
00:35:00.407 --> 00:35:02.326
You gotta treat everybody well,

524
00:35:02.409 --> 00:35:04.036
no matter who they are,
it don't matter.


525
00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.955
Except Manson,
he's nuts that guy.


526
00:35:21.595 --> 00:35:24.765
<i>Around that period</i>
<i>that I came up</i>
<i>to Hollywood, you know,</i>


527
00:35:24.848 --> 00:35:27.351
<i>that was the era of Van Halen.</i>

528
00:35:27.434 --> 00:35:30.687
You know, Van Halen
got signed out of the Whiskey
in the late 70s.


529
00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:39.363
I got to see them do
their first album at The Whisky,


530
00:35:39.446 --> 00:35:43.158
and it was insane,
I'd never heard of them.


531
00:35:45.994 --> 00:35:47.788
Me and my friends
were all into Van Halen


532
00:35:47.871 --> 00:35:50.058
and they were playing,
they were doing some
release party.


533
00:35:50.082 --> 00:35:51.875
<i>So I come down,
I was a little kid,</i>


534
00:35:51.959 --> 00:35:55.462
<i>and there's just thousands
of people in the street.</i>


535
00:35:55.545 --> 00:35:58.340
<i>I mean you've never seen
so many people in your life</i>


536
00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:01.343
<i>and they're all in front</i>
<i>of the Whisky trying</i>
<i>to get into the Whisky</i>


537
00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:02.302
<i>to see Van Halen.</i>

538
00:36:02.386 --> 00:36:04.596
And someone announces
that the tickets are on sale


539
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.306
at Tower Records
down the street,


540
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.767
so everyone runs from The Whisky
over to Tower Records


541
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.770
<i>trying to get their tickets,</i>
<i>and then some fuck up</i>
<i>happened over there,</i>


542
00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:13.605
<i>the tickets end up
being sold here.</i>


543
00:36:13.689 --> 00:36:16.984
<i>Sold the 500 tickets</i>
<i>in about four seconds,</i>
<i>and it was just mayhem.</i>


544
00:36:17.067 --> 00:36:18.652
<i>I mean, the SWAT team, you know,</i>

545
00:36:18.735 --> 00:36:22.864
<i>the whole nine yards was</i>
<i>out here protecting</i>
<i>the Sunset Blvd from this,</i>


546
00:36:22.948 --> 00:36:25.701
<i>like, potential riot
from this Van Halen crowd.</i>


547
00:36:25.784 --> 00:36:29.329
<i>I went up to The Rainbow</i>
<i>just to, you know,</i>
<i>say hi to my Grandpa and stuff,</i>


548
00:36:29.413 --> 00:36:31.349
and he made me walk
Weird Al Yankovich
into the show.


549
00:36:31.373 --> 00:36:34.251
<i>So I got to go see
Van Halen with Weird Al.</i>


550
00:36:34.376 --> 00:36:36.169
<i>And it was the coolest
night ever.</i>


551
00:36:41.008 --> 00:36:45.262
<i>When we saw Van Halen take off
and it was a local band,</i>


552
00:36:45.387 --> 00:36:49.141
and everybody was aware
of who they were,
and how good they were.


553
00:36:49.224 --> 00:36:52.394
We knew a door had
flung open on that.


554
00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:01.153
I've seen a lot of bands
at the Whisky.


555
00:37:01.236 --> 00:37:04.656
But one of the important gigs
for as far as The Whisky,


556
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.243
<i>and LA and all that
was I saw Motley Crue there.</i>


557
00:37:10.537 --> 00:37:13.498
<i>Motley Crue,</i>
<i>this leather</i>
<i>and chain clad band</i>


558
00:37:13.582 --> 00:37:16.460
<i>pushed their way</i>
<i>through the LA club circuit</i>
<i>just two years ago.</i>


559
00:37:16.543 --> 00:37:19.296
<i>Now with the release</i>
<i>of their second album</i>
Shout At The Devil,


560
00:37:19.379 --> 00:37:23.300
<i>Motley Crue has them</i>
<i>waiting around the block</i>
<i>for hours in the cold and rain.</i>


561
00:37:23.425 --> 00:37:25.093
Motley Crue!

562
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:27.804
<i>A lot of us got record deals.</i>

563
00:37:27.888 --> 00:37:32.267
<i>Quiet Riot, Motley,
W.A.S.P., Ratt, Dokken,</i>


564
00:37:32.351 --> 00:37:34.811
that's when we really
took over the strip.


565
00:37:34.895 --> 00:37:36.897
It was just crazy here.

566
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:51.119
<i>From right here at The Rainbow</i>
<i>down to the edge</i>
<i>of The Whisky corner,</i>


567
00:37:51.203 --> 00:37:53.288
<i>it was just packed.</i>

568
00:37:53.372 --> 00:37:56.875
Get set for three hours
of the loudest, rudest,


569
00:37:56.958 --> 00:38:00.462
crudest, heaviest, meanest,
music around.


570
00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:04.925
It's time
for the Headbangers ball.


571
00:38:07.761 --> 00:38:11.598
It was just total domination
on TV, radio, concerts,


572
00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:16.520
everything was dominated
from the bands that came
from this strip right here.


573
00:38:16.603 --> 00:38:18.855
I think Poison
are fucking great!


574
00:38:18.939 --> 00:38:22.776
And there were so many
signed bands living
here and all friends,


575
00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:25.570
so it was a real,
real community
and a really cool scene.


576
00:38:25.654 --> 00:38:30.659
<i>I was signed</i>
<i>with W.A.S.P. for four years,</i>
<i>all the way up to about '87.</i>


577
00:38:31.451 --> 00:38:33.495
<i>We were all touring so much,</i>

578
00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:37.791
we weren't even aware
that there was a second wave
of metal coming out of LA.


579
00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:45.424
<i>How the fuck are you doing?</i>

580
00:38:46.133 --> 00:38:48.093
<i>Is it fucking hot
in this fucking place?</i>


581
00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:54.474
<i>Been a long time.</i>

582
00:39:06.153 --> 00:39:07.737
<i>Approximately one year ago,</i>

583
00:39:07.821 --> 00:39:10.407
<i>an LA club band
hoping to gain recognition</i>


584
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.868
<i>released their first album</i>
Appetite for Destruction.


585
00:39:12.951 --> 00:39:17.164
<i>They say</i>
<i>the stones to the 60's were</i>
<i>the kings of their genre.</i>


586
00:39:17.247 --> 00:39:19.958
<i>They say Aerosmith in
the 70's was the same thing,</i>


587
00:39:20.041 --> 00:39:24.212
<i>they say in the late 80'</i>
<i>going into the 90's it is</i>
<i>Guns N' Roses.</i>


588
00:39:26.882 --> 00:39:29.259
<i>It was
just Guns N' Roses, LA Guns,</i>


589
00:39:29.342 --> 00:39:32.679
<i>Faster Pussycat thing</i>
<i>happening and the whole city</i>
<i>was buzzing,</i>


590
00:39:32.762 --> 00:39:37.684
and I was fortunate,
I got right out of WASP
and right into LA Guns.


591
00:39:37.767 --> 00:39:41.730
I just watched that whole thing,
that whole second wave
take over too,


592
00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:43.607
especially GNR,
how big they got.


593
00:39:45.609 --> 00:39:48.945
Axl Rose,
he came on stage
and he started talking,


594
00:39:49.029 --> 00:39:51.907
he said we played
this town in Florida,


595
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.868
and the Mayor said we'll
never play there again.


596
00:39:54.951 --> 00:39:58.955
Well he can suck my dick,
he grabbed his privates.


597
00:40:00.665 --> 00:40:02.584
<i>One of my biggest shows as a kid</i>

598
00:40:02.667 --> 00:40:05.670
<i>was Guns N' Roses and Metallica
at the Rose Bowl,</i>


599
00:40:06.963 --> 00:40:10.050
and I run into my Grandpa
at like 12 years old,


600
00:40:10.133 --> 00:40:11.861
and he's like, what the fuck
are you doing here?


601
00:40:11.885 --> 00:40:14.429
Like the last person
you'd think you're run into


602
00:40:14.513 --> 00:40:17.474
at a venue that holds
a hundred thousand people
is your grandfather.


603
00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:18.600
But that happened.

604
00:40:19.726 --> 00:40:20.477
He's hanging out.

605
00:40:20.602 --> 00:40:23.480
They invited him down,
he was there, you know,
he had his laminate on,


606
00:40:23.605 --> 00:40:24.832
you know,
he was going backstage.


607
00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:27.317
I was trying
to go to the bathroom
and I ran right into him.


608
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.155
Guns N' Roses was
a good show, good group,
I like them.


609
00:40:32.239 --> 00:40:33.490
I still like 'em.

610
00:40:35.492 --> 00:40:37.911
<i>In the early days
of Guns N' Roses,</i>


611
00:40:37.994 --> 00:40:40.163
we used to hang out
at The Rainbow all the time.


612
00:40:40.247 --> 00:40:43.416
<i>When I joined</i>
<i>Guns N' Roses,</i>
<i>we always came back here.</i>


613
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.169
You know,
we had our booth,
which is the corner booth.


614
00:40:46.253 --> 00:40:48.797
<i>Slash's name is on that booth.</i>

615
00:40:50.924 --> 00:40:53.385
We all sat there,
but he claimed it.


616
00:40:54.553 --> 00:40:57.722
<i>You know the booth</i>
<i>thing is just something</i>
<i>that materialized,</i>


617
00:40:57.806 --> 00:40:59.933
I don't know
if it was intentional.


618
00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:03.478
<i>They just put this one picture
of me in the back booth,</i>


619
00:41:03.562 --> 00:41:07.983
and that sort
of just turned into,
like, Slash's booth somehow.


620
00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:11.278
<i>They probably thought maybe,</i>
<i>you know, with all</i>
<i>those pizza's and stuff,</i>


621
00:41:11.361 --> 00:41:14.281
maybe it's time to give him
some sort of a booth, you know.


622
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.456
<i>We always felt
protected in our booth</i>


623
00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:28.211
<i>and people didn't</i>
<i>really bother us</i>
<i>because this was our place.</i>


624
00:41:29.838 --> 00:41:33.675
<i>And Mario, the guys</i>
<i>and Mikeal would say,</i>
<i>"Hey, this is your home.</i>


625
00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:35.635
You could do
whatever you want here.


626
00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:37.721
You want
to film a video, do it."


627
00:41:37.804 --> 00:41:41.641
there was no contracts
or asking for money,
or any of that bullshit.


628
00:41:49.232 --> 00:41:52.485
<i>The first video</i>
<i>that I performed</i>
<i>in with Guns N' Roses</i>


629
00:41:52.569 --> 00:41:54.529
<i>was shot right here
at the Roxy with Arnold.</i>


630
00:41:55.614 --> 00:41:58.825
We all sat in here
waiting for our scenes
to come up


631
00:41:58.908 --> 00:42:01.745
because as you know,
filming stuff,
you gotta set cameras or lights.


632
00:42:01.828 --> 00:42:05.582
<i>Arnold had a trailer that</i>
<i>was parked in the parking lot,</i>
<i>we'd all go over there.</i>


633
00:42:05.665 --> 00:42:10.420
I remember we went in there
and he's smoking cigars
and drinking Goldschlager.


634
00:42:11.504 --> 00:42:13.840
And we all did shots with him.

635
00:42:16.259 --> 00:42:19.262
<i>So by the time we shot</i>
<i>the last scene where Arnold</i>
<i>comes out of the Roxy</i>


636
00:42:19.346 --> 00:42:21.222
<i>and we're all standing in a line</i>

637
00:42:21.306 --> 00:42:24.267
<i>where it's Slash, me,
Duff, Dizzy and Axl,</i>


638
00:42:24.351 --> 00:42:26.978
we'd been in here
for about four hours
drinking heavily.


639
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.608
So, by the time we got
to the film set, if you watch,


640
00:42:31.691 --> 00:42:35.111
<i>we're very wobbly</i>
<i>on that last scene,</i>
<i>specially Slash.</i>


641
00:42:43.578 --> 00:42:45.455
<i>You know,
we shot many videos here.</i>


642
00:42:51.252 --> 00:42:54.964
<i>When we shot part
of a video called Estranged,</i>


643
00:42:55.048 --> 00:43:00.553
which is one of a three
part epic video series


644
00:43:00.637 --> 00:43:02.013
that Guns N' Roses did.

645
00:43:02.097 --> 00:43:04.057
<i>I remember going to that,</i>

646
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.435
<i>and that was just</i>
<i>amazing to see a video</i>
<i>being filmed at our club.</i>


647
00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:10.980
<i>And then I gave them a guitar
that I threw off a cliff</i>


648
00:43:11.064 --> 00:43:13.066
<i>for the "Don't Cry" video.</i>

649
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.070
That was a good Les Paul too,
it went neck first
off this cliff,


650
00:43:17.153 --> 00:43:22.492
and it came back
in three pieces, and we sort
of tied it back together.


651
00:43:24.911 --> 00:43:27.539
<i>We don't buy any</i>
<i>of this memorabilia</i>
<i>or the guitars and things,</i>


652
00:43:27.622 --> 00:43:29.457
they're given to us regularly.

653
00:43:30.291 --> 00:43:34.170
Phil Campbell from Motörhead
gave me the one that's over
my head somewhere here.


654
00:43:34.254 --> 00:43:37.674
That's like a $5000 guitar,
but he wanted it to be
in The Rainbow.


655
00:43:37.757 --> 00:43:40.802
We got Eddie Van Halen's guitar
up there, we've got tons
of drum heads.


656
00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:42.554
I mean all sorts
of cool memorabilia.


657
00:43:42.637 --> 00:43:44.013
<i>And all
the pictures on the walls</i>


658
00:43:44.097 --> 00:43:46.266
<i>of all the famous rock stars
that have been here or...</i>


659
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:48.143
<i>I've given
them their gold albums.</i>


660
00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:49.811
<i>It's a little bit of a museum,</i>

661
00:43:49.894 --> 00:43:52.480
it's like we're the real
Hard Rock Café, you know.


662
00:43:52.564 --> 00:43:56.359
<i>The story I heard is</i>
<i>that the guys</i>
<i>who started Hard Rock,</i>


663
00:43:56.443 --> 00:43:59.237
<i>got the idea from The Rainbow.</i>

664
00:43:59.988 --> 00:44:01.406
I would not be surprised.

665
00:44:02.282 --> 00:44:06.578
So Mario, you know, I brought
him one of my Guns N' Roses
snare drums,


666
00:44:06.661 --> 00:44:11.166
which was like
a signature series
drum that they made for me,


667
00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:15.754
it says "To Mario
and The Rainbow, Matt Sorum,
Guns N' fucking Roses".


668
00:44:16.337 --> 00:44:20.258
And Mario says, "Matt, what's
with the language?


669
00:44:20.341 --> 00:44:22.093
<i>You know
I don't like it when you cuss."</i>


670
00:44:22.177 --> 00:44:26.389
You know, I'm like, "Mario,
I mean, we're in The Rainbow,
I mean, really?"


671
00:44:26.473 --> 00:44:30.351
<i>He takes a piece of tape
and covers up the "fuckin'."</i>


672
00:44:30.435 --> 00:44:33.980
He thought
I should be respectful
of what's on the wall,


673
00:44:34.063 --> 00:44:36.775
and not everybody wants to see
the word "fuckin'," okay?


674
00:44:38.026 --> 00:44:41.488
So, still up there and it still
got that old piece of tape


675
00:44:41.571 --> 00:44:44.532
from over twenty years ago.

676
00:44:45.533 --> 00:44:47.035
Are you still doing
rock n' roll?


677
00:44:47.118 --> 00:44:49.329
A few heavy metal
comedians around.


678
00:44:49.412 --> 00:44:50.914
Yeah, I had
a lot of fun with it.


679
00:44:52.874 --> 00:44:56.628
<i>I was good friends</i>
<i>with Sam Kinison, who came</i>
<i>to The Rainbow all the time.</i>


680
00:44:56.711 --> 00:45:00.924
We used to come here,
and the funny thing is
that Sam would often drink,


681
00:45:01.007 --> 00:45:04.677
and yet we would be
called upon to help walk some
of the rock stars out the door.


682
00:45:04.761 --> 00:45:07.263
<i>Like Ozzy Osbourne,
he'd get a little tipsy.</i>


683
00:45:13.311 --> 00:45:16.981
And then me and Sam Kinison
would walk them out to the car.


684
00:45:22.362 --> 00:45:24.465
And it was an honor, here I am
with a legend like this,


685
00:45:24.489 --> 00:45:27.242
and I'm helping
him walk to his car.
Hooking up under his arm.


686
00:45:27.325 --> 00:45:29.327
"Oh thank you Ron,
appreciate it.


687
00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:30.721
Thank you very much,
thank you Sam."


688
00:45:30.745 --> 00:45:34.874
And then of course, me and Bill
used to help Sam Kinison
get to his car.


689
00:45:35.792 --> 00:45:38.294
<i>He had this great car,</i>
<i>it was a corvette,</i>
<i>it said EX REV,</i>


690
00:45:38.378 --> 00:45:42.048
<i>'cause Sam was</i>
<i>a Pentecostal minister</i>
<i>in a former life.</i>


691
00:45:42.131 --> 00:45:44.926
Nobody ever
helped me out the door
and I'm kind of jealous.


692
00:45:45.009 --> 00:45:47.762
- What was Ozzy like?
- Oh Ozzy's great,
so funny, so mellow,


693
00:45:47.846 --> 00:45:50.557
you know I was expecting,
"Ah, you got any bats on you?


694
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.643
Rawr! Can I get some
raw meat, you know?"


695
00:45:53.726 --> 00:45:55.412
And he's not
like that at all, he's so kind.


696
00:45:55.436 --> 00:45:59.482
You know, he's so British,
"Hello, how are you? I've always
been afraid to meet you."


697
00:45:59.566 --> 00:46:00.441
That's what he told me.

698
00:46:00.525 --> 00:46:03.712
"I'm afraid to meet you because
I heard you were too wild
for me to hang out with."


699
00:46:03.736 --> 00:46:06.698
Oh yeah, yeah, great,
Ozzy Osbourne's
afraid to meet me?


700
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:53.244
<i>I can't tell you how</i>
<i>many people that my father has</i>
<i>lectured on their drug issues.</i>


701
00:46:53.328 --> 00:46:54.579
Of using drugs.

702
00:46:54.662 --> 00:46:57.665
He will turn to customers here
that are regular drinkers


703
00:46:57.749 --> 00:47:00.418
still to this day and say
"You drink too much."


704
00:47:00.501 --> 00:47:04.130
We sell drinks for a living,
okay, he will sit down and tell
them "You drink too much."


705
00:47:04.213 --> 00:47:07.091
<i>There's a few
characters like that in town</i>


706
00:47:07.175 --> 00:47:11.387
<i>who cared about the people</i>
<i>that frequented</i>
<i>their establishments.</i>


707
00:47:11.471 --> 00:47:14.807
That wasn't uncommon, it is now.

708
00:47:15.558 --> 00:47:16.768
Mario's an exception.

709
00:47:16.851 --> 00:47:21.898
That's why I didn't care so much
when my daughter Amy
would come around.


710
00:47:22.023 --> 00:47:24.025
Because I knew
that there was this


711
00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:28.112
protective almost family thing.

712
00:47:36.329 --> 00:47:38.373
[Matt] <i>When I got some success,</i>

713
00:47:39.248 --> 00:47:42.001
I remember my drinking getting
a little out of control.


714
00:47:42.085 --> 00:47:43.836
'Cause now
I had money to buy beers,


715
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.590
and buy beers for my friends,
you know, and do some shots too.


716
00:47:47.674 --> 00:47:50.551
And I remember Mario
pulling me aside one night


717
00:47:50.635 --> 00:47:54.013
and he literally gave me
that fatherly talk,


718
00:47:54.097 --> 00:47:56.391
<i>because my Dad wasn't around
up here in Hollywood.</i>


719
00:47:56.474 --> 00:47:59.352
<i>I was a kid running around
on my own, you know.</i>


720
00:47:59.435 --> 00:48:02.647
And he said "Matt, I don't like
how you're acting kid,


721
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:03.940
you're drinking too much."

722
00:48:04.899 --> 00:48:06.567
I was like
"Aww, come on, Mario."


723
00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:11.280
"No! Listen to me.
I'm telling you you drink
too much, simmer down."


724
00:48:13.032 --> 00:48:17.620
And, you
know, that really stuck
with me, you know, because he...


725
00:48:18.788 --> 00:48:23.292
He was like a father figure
to a lot of us
who had come to Hollywood,


726
00:48:23.376 --> 00:48:24.961
you know, looking for the dream

727
00:48:26.462 --> 00:48:31.009
and we were away from family
and any sort of grounding,
you know.


728
00:48:33.094 --> 00:48:35.680
<i>Over the years, you
know, I had different issues,</i>


729
00:48:36.848 --> 00:48:40.059
and Mario had taken care
of me a few times.


730
00:48:40.143 --> 00:48:42.687
<i>He definitely
saw where I was at,</i>


731
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:46.941
and he did give me sort
of a speech as to, you know,
what the fuck am I doing,


732
00:48:47.025 --> 00:48:48.401
why would I, blah blah blah...

733
00:48:48.484 --> 00:48:52.905
And, you know, and I listened
to him within reason.


734
00:48:52.989 --> 00:48:54.657
You know, I took it to heart.

735
00:49:00.455 --> 00:49:03.041
<i>The grunge era came in the 90's,</i>

736
00:49:04.417 --> 00:49:06.002
<i>it cut down
everybody on the streets,</i>


737
00:49:06.085 --> 00:49:08.921
<i>you know, it wasn't craziness
out on the streets in the 90's.</i>


738
00:49:12.967 --> 00:49:16.137
<i>Because
it is more overcast here,</i>


739
00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:21.392
<i>we don't spend 300 days a year</i>
<i>playing volleyball like</i>
<i>they do down in California.</i>


740
00:49:21.476 --> 00:49:25.313
You tend to spend more time
indoors. Whether reading a book,
or seeing films.


741
00:49:25.396 --> 00:49:28.066
Or practicing
music in your garage.


742
00:49:47.627 --> 00:49:50.129
<i>Musical tastes changed,</i>

743
00:49:52.548 --> 00:49:55.760
<i>the glamorous part
of the scene came and went.</i>


744
00:49:56.844 --> 00:49:59.430
<i>Once the guys started
cutting their hair</i>


745
00:49:59.514 --> 00:50:03.684
<i>and looked like, let me see,</i>
<i>are you a Domino's</i>
<i>pizza delivery boy?</i>


746
00:50:03.768 --> 00:50:06.020
Do you work
for the sanitation department?


747
00:50:06.104 --> 00:50:08.231
Or are you in a band?
You're done.


748
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.908
<i>As far as the flow</i>
<i>when it comes to The Rainbow,</i>
<i>it kept a consistent thing.</i>


749
00:50:18.991 --> 00:50:21.911
The Rainbow was
still kind of catering
to the 80's people.


750
00:50:21.994 --> 00:50:25.456
You know, The Rainbow
kind of kept that rock n' roll,


751
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.000
that old, you know,

752
00:50:28.084 --> 00:50:32.255
<i>But, as far</i>
<i>as The Whisky, it definitely</i>
<i>affected the business.</i>


753
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:37.051
The economy changed,
and when the economy changed,
the industry changed.


754
00:50:38.803 --> 00:50:41.848
<i>You had the record companies
that backed every group.</i>


755
00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:45.601
<i>When we threw a party</i>
<i>at the Whisky, you had Capitol,</i>
<i>you had Atlantic.</i>


756
00:50:45.685 --> 00:50:48.446
<i>You had all these major</i>
<i>companies that literally</i>
<i>came behind the groups</i>


757
00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:49.522
<i>and backed them up.</i>

758
00:50:49.605 --> 00:50:51.607
The record companies,
they weren't throwing out


759
00:50:51.691 --> 00:50:55.444
several thousand dollars
a night to promote a new group
that was coming out.


760
00:50:55.528 --> 00:51:00.116
<i>And back in the late</i>
<i>90's when the record sales</i>
<i>started to drop</i>


761
00:51:00.241 --> 00:51:02.493
<i>and music became free,</i>

762
00:51:02.577 --> 00:51:05.121
the bands stopped making money,
so the bands stopped touring.


763
00:51:05.204 --> 00:51:07.331
That's when it got bad,
and that was my generation.


764
00:51:07.415 --> 00:51:11.419
Money got tight. There were
times that it was strained.


765
00:51:11.502 --> 00:51:13.129
<i>My grandpa got real sick.</i>

766
00:51:13.212 --> 00:51:16.257
He had cancer, and they had
to take him for chemotherapy.


767
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.969
<i>He had a very rare type
of cancer that was in his face.</i>


768
00:51:20.052 --> 00:51:22.930
<i>They actually had to remove
his nose at one point.</i>


769
00:51:23.014 --> 00:51:27.143
<i>He had a 10 percent survival</i>
<i>rate, well he beat that,</i>
<i>he was tough.</i>


770
00:51:27.268 --> 00:51:29.145
<i>And my Dad was by his side,</i>

771
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.272
so it was basically
my Dad and my Grandpa,


772
00:51:31.355 --> 00:51:33.858
for a long time,
were just non-existent.


773
00:51:33.941 --> 00:51:35.526
<i>When it comes to my son,</i>

774
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.695
<i>at first it was like,
you have to cover the business,</i>


775
00:51:37.778 --> 00:51:39.864
<i>you know, you run the weekends
and answer the phone.</i>


776
00:51:39.947 --> 00:51:43.784
And I'm actually quite amazed
that he picked everything
up just like that.


777
00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:46.537
<i>Within two years</i>
<i>all of a sudden</i>
<i>he's booking groups.</i>


778
00:51:46.621 --> 00:51:49.957
<i>I've been around</i>
<i>it my whole life,</i>
<i>so it was just natural,</i>


779
00:51:50.041 --> 00:51:51.959
<i>I just took over and started
doing everything.</i>


780
00:51:52.043 --> 00:51:54.253
No matter what was going on
in our personal life,


781
00:51:54.337 --> 00:51:55.838
no matter
what was going on at home,


782
00:51:55.922 --> 00:51:58.299
it was like, I couldn't let
that effect business.


783
00:51:58.382 --> 00:52:00.843
Like the business needs
to go on, this is
what we live off of,


784
00:52:00.927 --> 00:52:02.845
<i>the show must go on, literally.</i>

785
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.784
<i>I started off, I did all</i>
<i>System of a Down's</i>
<i>first shows here,</i>


786
00:52:24.867 --> 00:52:26.118
<i>all Hoobastank's first shows,</i>

787
00:52:26.202 --> 00:52:29.163
<i>I was booking Hoobastank</i>
<i>for 10 years before they</i>
<i>got a record deal.</i>


788
00:52:29.247 --> 00:52:31.666
Linkin Park, I booked
those guys for years,


789
00:52:31.749 --> 00:52:33.793
<i>we did Eminem's first LA show.</i>

790
00:52:33.876 --> 00:52:36.587
<i>You know, we heard
about this white rapper Eminem,</i>


791
00:52:36.671 --> 00:52:39.465
<i>and it was all the big rage.</i>
<i>You know, he wanted</i>
<i>fifteen hundred bucks,</i>


792
00:52:39.548 --> 00:52:42.051
we were like, wow that's a lot,
but we'll give it a shot.


793
00:52:42.134 --> 00:52:45.221
<i>That show is the first show
that Dr. Dre saw him,</i>


794
00:52:45.304 --> 00:52:47.640
<i>and that's when he got signed,
right after that show.</i>


795
00:52:49.016 --> 00:52:53.521
<i>Anything out of that late 90's</i>
<i>early 2000's generation</i>
<i>we helped out,</i>


796
00:52:53.604 --> 00:52:56.941
<i>and we booked all their shows</i>
<i>and started them</i>
<i>from the ground up.</i>


797
00:53:01.153 --> 00:53:03.823
<i>My grandson,
thank God he came along,</i>


798
00:53:03.906 --> 00:53:06.867
you know if it weren't for him
forget about it,
it wouldn't happen.


799
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:10.579
I'm very proud,
proud of the fact that my son
was able to take over,


800
00:53:10.663 --> 00:53:13.350
and this kid was born
with a silver spoon,
or gold spoon in his mouth,


801
00:53:13.374 --> 00:53:15.668
doesn't have to work,
didn't have to do anything


802
00:53:15.751 --> 00:53:19.171
and he gets out and works
as hard if not harder
than I worked.


803
00:53:19.255 --> 00:53:20.256
Day and night.

804
00:53:20.339 --> 00:53:25.052
And that brought a joy
to my father, that was
his pride, was his grandson.


805
00:53:27.054 --> 00:53:29.098
<i>He keeps that place
open seven days a week,</i>


806
00:53:29.181 --> 00:53:32.226
<i>when we used to open maybe
three, four days a week.</i>


807
00:53:32.893 --> 00:53:36.814
And he knows
the music better than my son,
probably better than me.


808
00:53:36.897 --> 00:53:38.607
He's a booker,
that's what he does.


809
00:53:38.691 --> 00:53:41.527
To me it was never
about the partying
or about the fun.


810
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:45.072
Like I'm just a music freak,
I love music, I love concerts.


811
00:53:45.156 --> 00:53:48.576
<i>And now he runs the whole show over there.
He runs it all for us.</i>


812
00:53:48.659 --> 00:53:52.371
I don't really have an actual
position at either place,
I'm just the boss.


813
00:53:52.455 --> 00:53:54.707
I rarely will
walk into the Whisky,


814
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:57.752
and to be quite honest with you
I'm at an age where I can't
stand the noise.


815
00:54:02.423 --> 00:54:04.550
<i>I've had some
pretty crazy shows.</i>


816
00:54:04.633 --> 00:54:07.094
<i>I've had some shows
where they get pretty violent.</i>


817
00:54:07.178 --> 00:54:08.471
It just depends on the crowd.

818
00:54:08.554 --> 00:54:10.723
<i>I had a friend over
at Taang! Records,</i>


819
00:54:10.806 --> 00:54:12.646
<i>he was like, "Oh let's
put these British bands,</i>


820
00:54:12.683 --> 00:54:17.146
you know like really just
like Oi! type punk rock bands,"


821
00:54:17.229 --> 00:54:20.399
and I mean, this place
just broke out into a riot.


822
00:54:23.361 --> 00:54:26.405
<i>There was like skinheads,
and the non-skinheads,</i>


823
00:54:26.489 --> 00:54:31.035
they're fighting, I mean you had
every type of bad person
in the punk rock scene


824
00:54:31.118 --> 00:54:34.872
all at one place at one time,
literally just fighting.


825
00:54:34.955 --> 00:54:39.835
Somehow a gunshot went off,
the place was berserk,


826
00:54:39.919 --> 00:54:43.714
<i>SWAT team, the barricades,</i>
<i>the whole nine yards,</i>
<i>I mean it was insane.</i>


827
00:54:43.798 --> 00:54:47.760
<i>Another one,</i>
<i>it was like a hardcore show,</i>
<i>pretty rough crowd.</i>


828
00:54:47.843 --> 00:54:50.096
<i>These thugs came in
and started a big fight.</i>


829
00:54:50.179 --> 00:54:51.764
There's trash cans
getting thrown,


830
00:54:51.847 --> 00:54:53.599
people getting the shit
kicked out of them.


831
00:54:53.682 --> 00:54:56.644
We had it to the point
where all the security
guards were inside the club,


832
00:54:56.727 --> 00:54:58.312
and the maniacs were outside.

833
00:54:58.396 --> 00:55:01.273
<i>My sister's husband</i>
<i>was just hired</i>
<i>as a security guard here.</i>


834
00:55:01.357 --> 00:55:03.502
<i>He doesn't really know how
to deal with these situations.</i>


835
00:55:03.526 --> 00:55:06.654
He goes outside,
the second he walks out there
he gets clipped in the jaw.


836
00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:08.948
And I mean, there's just blood
gushing everywhere,


837
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:12.326
so we go out to help him,
he goes around the side
trying to help somebody else,


838
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:13.994
and gets hit again.

839
00:55:16.038 --> 00:55:17.540
<i>Fully destroyed his jaw,</i>

840
00:55:17.623 --> 00:55:20.376
like broken
every little piece of his jaw.


841
00:55:20.459 --> 00:55:22.420
And then that was
his last day of security.


842
00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:26.006
Um, he sells real estate.

843
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.634
You know.
It's a lot calmer of a job.


844
00:55:33.848 --> 00:55:36.392
<i>This is tradition
at its core, you know.</i>


845
00:55:36.517 --> 00:55:40.271
<i>And thank God,</i>
<i>because I'd hate it to fall</i>
<i>into somebody else's hands.</i>


846
00:55:47.403 --> 00:55:50.406
<i>Sunset Strip</i>
<i>as we know it is being</i>
<i>stripped away a little bit.</i>


847
00:55:50.531 --> 00:55:53.409
<i>You can find</i>
<i>construction going up</i>
<i>everywhere on the strip.</i>


848
00:55:53.492 --> 00:55:57.997
<i>Developers buying</i>
<i>old buildings to replace them</i>
<i>with luxury hotels.</i>


849
00:56:29.236 --> 00:56:31.197
<i>The Rainbow
hasn't changed at all.</i>


850
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.407
<i>I came back to Los Angeles,</i>

851
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:38.245
<i>and I remember walking</i>
<i>into The Rainbow after</i>
<i>not seeing it for 15 years</i>


852
00:56:38.329 --> 00:56:42.208
and going
"It hasn't fucking changed."


853
00:56:42.291 --> 00:56:47.254
<i>They've always seemed</i>
<i>to keep the integrity</i>
<i>of the club intact.</i>


854
00:56:47.338 --> 00:56:49.423
It's so real.

855
00:56:50.382 --> 00:56:52.801
And it has been...
I don't know how they do it.


856
00:56:52.885 --> 00:56:56.388
<i>It goes back</i>
<i>to the atmosphere, you keep</i>
<i>that comfortable atmosphere.</i>


857
00:56:57.348 --> 00:57:01.769
<i>This is still the base décor</i>
<i>that you see around here</i>
<i>from the old Villa Nova.</i>


858
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:06.148
<i>Finish the booths,
or redo the tops of the tables,</i>


859
00:57:06.232 --> 00:57:08.067
<i>but you have to keep it
looking the same.</i>


860
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:09.944
If you change it...
My father taught me that.


861
00:57:10.027 --> 00:57:12.446
If you change it, you'll change
the face of the business.


862
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.990
And so people today are
still comfortable being here.


863
00:57:17.117 --> 00:57:20.955
<i>We want people to feel
like they're in rock n' roll.</i>


864
00:57:21.038 --> 00:57:26.252
<i>Now we have</i>
<i>a whole revitalization</i>
<i>of the 80's rock movement,</i>


865
00:57:26.335 --> 00:57:29.713
and I love the fact
that you can go to The Rainbow,


866
00:57:29.797 --> 00:57:32.883
feel the rock vibe,
come to the Whisky
and see Dokken,


867
00:57:32.967 --> 00:57:35.094
<i>or see Warrant
still in this day.</i>


868
00:57:35.177 --> 00:57:36.720
That's what we're going for,

869
00:57:36.804 --> 00:57:41.141
I'm not really a fan
of music of today,
and where music's going.


870
00:57:52.778 --> 00:57:56.407
Technology is
the new crack of music.


871
00:57:56.490 --> 00:58:00.452
<i>It's too easy to press</i>
<i>a button and sound better</i>
<i>than you normally do.</i>


872
00:58:00.536 --> 00:58:03.497
<i>So almost everybody
that gets up on stage,</i>


873
00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:06.959
I'm talking about big bands,
are not playing live.


874
00:58:22.016 --> 00:58:26.562
It really isn't this thing
of wanting to learn
how to play a guitar.


875
00:58:26.687 --> 00:58:29.898
<i>Wanting to master drums,
wanting to play bass or sing.</i>


876
00:58:34.361 --> 00:58:36.238
<i>It's part and parcel
of the digital age</i>


877
00:58:36.322 --> 00:58:38.532
<i>and also
the way the record companies</i>


878
00:58:38.616 --> 00:58:40.376
have decided the direction
that they've gone.


879
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:43.287
<i>But I think that the magic
that you hear on a record</i>


880
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:46.248
<i>comes from people really
interacting in the same room.</i>


881
00:58:46.332 --> 00:58:50.836
It's not something that you
can do from different people's
living rooms from a distance.


882
00:58:57.259 --> 00:59:00.304
<i>Having outlets, you know,
venues for young bands</i>


883
00:59:00.387 --> 00:59:03.515
<i>to get together and do
their thing is essential.</i>


884
00:59:03.599 --> 00:59:05.267
<i>Especially
if we're discovering music,</i>


885
00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:08.103
I mean that's an art
that is close to dead.


886
00:59:10.564 --> 00:59:12.149
<i>I think it's a shame,</i>

887
00:59:12.232 --> 00:59:17.821
<i>it makes</i>
<i>it really difficult</i>
<i>for new young acts and artists</i>


888
00:59:17.905 --> 00:59:19.615
to get a foot in the door.

889
00:59:21.075 --> 00:59:25.079
<i>The music business</i>
<i>itself is not catering</i>
<i>to rock n' roll at all.</i>


890
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.873
<i>I miss those times.</i>

891
00:59:32.753 --> 00:59:36.256
<i>You know, as far</i>
<i>as rock is concerned,</i>
<i>it's not viable to make music.</i>


892
00:59:39.134 --> 00:59:42.471
Here, I'll play a game
with you and see if you
can answer this question.


893
00:59:43.263 --> 00:59:46.517
<i>From 1958 until 1988</i>

894
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:52.272
name 100 classic,
iconic bands that will
stand the test of time.


895
00:59:52.356 --> 00:59:56.318
<i>Let me see, I've got Elvis,
The Beatles, The Stones,</i>


896
00:59:56.402 --> 01:00:00.155
Led Zeppelin, Hendrix,
in pop and R&B and stuff


897
01:00:00.239 --> 01:00:02.658
<i>you've got The Jackson Five,
Michael Jackson, Madonna,</i>


898
01:00:02.783 --> 01:00:05.411
<i>even disco,
Donna Summers on that level.</i>


899
01:00:05.494 --> 01:00:09.832
Motown, The Supremes,
it all happened
at the same time. Okay.


900
01:00:09.915 --> 01:00:13.419
From 1988 until today,

901
01:00:13.502 --> 01:00:16.630
<i>give me 5 bands that will stand
the test of time.</i>


902
01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:19.717
It's not on that level.

903
01:00:20.676 --> 01:00:22.404
Good evening,
thanks very much for joining us,


904
01:00:22.428 --> 01:00:24.263
the breaking news
tonight is sad.


905
01:00:24.346 --> 01:00:27.891
A founding member
of one of the most popular music
acts of all time has died.


906
01:00:27.975 --> 01:00:31.687
<i>Just 67 years old,</i>
<i>and he was quite simply,</i>
<i>a rock star.</i>


907
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.982
<i>The rock legend
David Bowie has died,</i>


908
01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.776
<i>he was 69 years of age.</i>

909
01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.654
<i>Tributes</i>
<i>from around the world</i>
<i>this morning for Tom Petty,</i>


910
01:00:40.738 --> 01:00:44.533
<i>who died</i>
<i>overnight at the age of 66.</i>
<i>The legendary rocker...</i>


911
01:00:44.616 --> 01:00:48.287
<i>Musician Prince</i>
<i>has died at his home</i>
<i>in Minneapolis,</i>


912
01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:50.414
<i>he was 57, and had been...</i>

913
01:00:50.497 --> 01:00:55.627
<i>Paul Katner, a giant of the 60's
music scene has died. He was 74...</i>


914
01:00:55.711 --> 01:00:57.129
<i>Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister,</i>

915
01:00:57.212 --> 01:00:59.065
<i>the front man for the heavy
metal band Motörhead</i>


916
01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.175
<i>has died at the age of 70.</i>

917
01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:06.805
<i>Sunset Strip</i>
<i>rock club owner Mario Maglieri</i>
<i>has died at the age of 93.</i>


918
01:01:22.696 --> 01:01:25.657
<i>That day I was in such
a state of shock, there was...</i>


919
01:01:25.741 --> 01:01:27.993
I mean,
just people on top of people,


920
01:01:28.076 --> 01:01:29.620
and literally
in a state of shock.


921
01:01:31.413 --> 01:01:33.624
<i>He was the godfather,
he was the icon.</i>


922
01:01:34.374 --> 01:01:37.085
<i>And nobody
could ever take his place.</i>


923
01:01:37.169 --> 01:01:39.880
<i>He was my hero, my hero.</i>

924
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.762
<i>He gave us
this block of rock n' roll.</i>


925
01:01:47.638 --> 01:01:49.681
<i>I don't know where
we would be without it.</i>


926
01:01:58.232 --> 01:01:59.608
<i>An era is gone.</i>

927
01:02:05.948 --> 01:02:09.785
<i>But Mikeal will carry on
and become an icon too I think.</i>


928
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:13.914
<i>And Mikey, the grandson,
he's just amazing.</i>


929
01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:19.461
<i>I think my son
is the future of the club,</i>


930
01:02:19.545 --> 01:02:24.383
and he's done a tremendous
job of carrying on
that generational thing.


931
01:02:27.135 --> 01:02:30.389
<i>My two daughters,</i>
<i>they keep it strong,</i>
<i>keep it alive,</i>


932
01:02:30.472 --> 01:02:32.808
we're a very close knit family.

933
01:02:32.933 --> 01:02:35.203
- She lives across the hall.
- She works down at the Whisky.


934
01:02:35.227 --> 01:02:36.547
- She works at the Whisky.
- I do.


935
01:02:36.603 --> 01:02:39.439
I worked here for many years.
Now I'm raising those cuties.


936
01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:41.066
<i>Now I have a grandson,</i>

937
01:02:41.149 --> 01:02:43.110
<i>I have another generation
that will come into it.</i>


938
01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:45.320
<i>And hopefully he'll be
the next one to come through.</i>


939
01:02:45.404 --> 01:02:47.197
I've got a daughter, we're good.

940
01:03:08.635 --> 01:03:11.054
<i>The premise of rock n' roll</i>

941
01:03:11.138 --> 01:03:13.849
<i>and the understanding
of what the word really means.</i>


942
01:03:16.101 --> 01:03:20.731
<i>Icon, which yeah, eventually
will we lose those icons,</i>


943
01:03:20.814 --> 01:03:22.941
<i>are they making any new ones?</i>

944
01:03:25.485 --> 01:03:29.990
<i>And I think</i>
<i>that's what Mikeal Jr</i>
<i>has holding in his hands.</i>


945
01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:32.826
<i>What kind of entertainment</i>
<i>is he gonna bring</i>
<i>to Sunset Boulevard</i>


946
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:34.620
<i>that's gonna say
that's the next big thing?</i>


947
01:03:34.703 --> 01:03:36.455
Where's the next Guns N' Roses?

948
01:03:36.538 --> 01:03:38.874
<i>Cause when you look
at Guns N' Roses,</i>


949
01:03:38.957 --> 01:03:41.877
<i>it wasn't just a band,
it was a cultural shift</i>


950
01:03:42.002 --> 01:03:45.589
<i>of music, fashion, style,</i>

951
01:03:45.672 --> 01:03:48.342
<i>as sense of being of who
you were as an individual.</i>


952
01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:51.136
<i>Like The Doors, like Van Halen.</i>

953
01:03:51.219 --> 01:03:55.015
Like any other band that came
out of the Sunset Strip.


954
01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:58.477
<i>The one great thing</i>
<i>that I learned</i>
<i>through rock n' roll</i>


955
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.272
<i>is that something
big will happen,</i>


956
01:04:02.356 --> 01:04:04.274
<i>where everyone all of a sudden,</i>

957
01:04:04.358 --> 01:04:08.820
you stop in your tracks
and go "Holy shit.
Something is exploding."


958
01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:14.177
<i>So if you're a rock</i>
<i>n' roll musician, you know</i>
<i>the history of rock n' roll,</i>


959
01:04:14.201 --> 01:04:17.371
<i>you know that rock n' roll
will never die.</i>


960
01:04:39.393 --> 01:04:42.187
<i>The Rainbow is</i>
<i>a right of passage</i>
<i>for the world of rock n' roll.</i>


961
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:45.148
This is the strip.
This is the home
of rock n' roll.


962
01:04:46.608 --> 01:04:48.276
<i>I'd hate for that place to go,</i>

963
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.612
<i>it'd just
sort of kill what's left</i>


964
01:04:50.696 --> 01:04:54.574
<i>of a really iconic chapter
in music history.</i>


965
01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:34.740
<i>This thing,
this small little place,</i>


966
01:05:34.823 --> 01:05:37.993
<i>just serves burgers
and beer and booze and stuff,</i>


967
01:05:38.994 --> 01:05:41.621
<i>but both Whisky and The Rainbow</i>

968
01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:44.666
<i>mean bucketsful for the culture.</i>

969
01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:47.419
<i>This place still breaks records.</i>

970
01:05:48.462 --> 01:05:51.465
<i>People from all over the world
come here just to see it.</i>


971
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:56.428
<i>Major, major artists,
major, major movie stars</i>


972
01:05:56.511 --> 01:05:58.764
<i>still come through here
on a regular basis.</i>


973
01:05:59.806 --> 01:06:01.725
<i>I don't think
rock will ever die,</i>


974
01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:04.186
<i>I don't think the music
will ever die so,</i>


975
01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:07.355
<i>The Rainbow and this strip</i>
<i>will be here forever</i>
<i>as far as I'm concerned.</i>


976
01:06:07.439 --> 01:06:11.651
<i>It's not the biggest place,
but it's the place.</i>


977
01:06:12.819 --> 01:06:14.863
<i>For me it was
the greatest time of my life.</i>


978
01:06:17.783 --> 01:06:20.327
<i>Rock n' roll
is about celebrating life.</i>


979
01:06:35.133 --> 01:06:36.718
<i>I want that feeling
to continue on.</i>


980
01:06:36.802 --> 01:06:38.970
<i>I want them all to feel</i>
<i>like they can always</i>
<i>come back.</i>


981
01:06:39.054 --> 01:06:40.514
<i>This is their home.</i>

982
01:06:43.725 --> 01:06:48.480
<i>It's gonna stay,</i>
<i>and it is the history</i>
<i>of the Sunset Strip.</i>


983
01:06:51.983 --> 01:06:56.905
<i>This classical period,</i>
<i>where possibly the best records</i>
<i>of all time were made.</i>


984
01:06:59.199 --> 01:07:02.702
<i>Being in the atmosphere</i>
<i>of Hollywood and creativity</i>
<i>of that era.</i>


985
01:07:03.495 --> 01:07:07.582
<i>It was just the coolest</i>
<i>feeling and vibe</i>
<i>that I ever experienced.</i>


986
01:07:10.043 --> 01:07:15.966
<i>The idea of pursuing
your dreams, and that energy.</i>


987
01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:21.680
<i>And I really</i>
<i>believe that The Rainbow</i>
<i>is the vortex for that energy.</i>


988
01:07:23.223 --> 01:07:26.226
<i>This is the history,
these are your roots.</i>


989
01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:29.479
The next kid can come in here,

990
01:07:29.563 --> 01:07:32.065
and some old guy like me
can sit him down and say


991
01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:38.071
"Listen kid, once upon a time,
there was a special place,
it was called The Rainbow."
