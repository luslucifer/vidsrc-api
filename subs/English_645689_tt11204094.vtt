1
00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:26.784
Will the defendant please stand?

2
00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:32.373
Kempton Bunton, you are charged
that on the 21st of March, 1961,


3
00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.708
you stole from the National Gallery

4
00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:39.797
the portrait of the Duke of Wellington
by the artist Francisco Goya


5
00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:43.008
to the value of £140,000.
Subs/Sync: PTNK


6
00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:45.427
How do you plead? 
Guilty or not guilty?

7
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.345
Not guilty.

8
00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.389
And that you created a public nuisance

9
00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:52.518
by depriving members of the public
of the opportunity to view the portrait.


10
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.728
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

11
00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:56.605
Same again, love. Not guilty.

12
00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:59.900
Mr. Cussen.

13
00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:02.403
Thank you, my lord.

14
00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:12.514
At this rate, you'll be giving
that Shakespeare a run for his money.


15
00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:15.726
Imagine if Jesus had been born a woman.

16
00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:20.564
- Well, what's it called?
- The Adventures of Susan Christ.


17
00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:23.734
Not my cup of tea, then.

18
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.278
Oh, well, you never know.

19
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:27.571
Recorded delivery?

20
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:30.157
Aye, good idea.

21
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.992
That'll be 2 shillings, Mr. Bunton.

22
00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.454
Come on, Mr. Singh.
We know you're in there.


23
00:02:36.997 --> 00:02:38.081
I know he's in.

24
00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.877
- Harry? Come on.
- All right.


25
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.003
We'll come back.

26
00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.630
- I know he's in.
- Aye.


27
00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:45.672
He's cooking.

28
00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:48.342
Right, cup of tea, then we'll do...

29
00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:50.093
Evening Chronicle. 
How can I help you?

30
00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:51.887
Is Barry Spence there, pet?

31
00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:54.348
- Just putting you through.
- Thank you.


32
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.559
Dorothy?

33
00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:58.727
I'm in here.

34
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.772
Would you be a sweetie
and clean the heads for me?


35
00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:05.150
Yes, of course.
Will I finish the fireplace first?


36
00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:07.236
It's up to you,
but I'm playing this afternoon.


37
00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.320
Busy, busy.

38
00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:11.323
Dorothy, as I was passing
Fenwick's the other day,


39
00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:13.617
I noticed that they had a sign up.

40
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.660
Storeman.

41
00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:16.495
Just in case your husband...

42
00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:21.667
I just mention it.

43
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.772
- Mr. Bunton.
- Curtain twitched.


44
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.571
Dad.

45
00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:54.449
Post Office. In the street.

46
00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:56.785
I know. Buy me five minutes.

47
00:03:56.868 --> 00:03:59.288
- Mr. Bunton?
- Cometh the hour, Jackie, lad.


48
00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:02.583
- Mr. Bunton?
- Can I help?


49
00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.085
We're here
to inspect your television license.


50
00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:08.922
Look at that.

51
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.300
- What?
- Fox.


52
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:12.759
Big fella.

53
00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:16.138
Any house with a television
is required to have a license.


54
00:04:16.263 --> 00:04:20.350
Our radar van detected a line output
transformer signal from this address,


55
00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:22.811
coming from a cathode ray tube
this time last week.


56
00:04:23.437 --> 00:04:25.522
- We haven't got one of them.
- That's a telly.


57
00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:28.233
Oh, we've got one of them.

58
00:04:28.358 --> 00:04:29.776
And do you have a license?

59
00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:31.194
In what sense?

60
00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:32.863
In the sense of having one,

61
00:04:33.697 --> 00:04:34.906
or not having one.

62
00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:38.493
A Mars a day
helps you work, rest, and play.


63
00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:41.121
Gentlemen, join me.
Robin Hood after the adverts.


64
00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:43.290
- Can we see your license, sir?
- Don't need one.


65
00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:46.043
We only watch ITV,
which is paid for by these.


66
00:04:46.126 --> 00:04:47.919
It's a mistake.
I'll go to the Post Office.


67
00:04:48.003 --> 00:04:50.589
This is no mistake. 
It is a political act.

68
00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:53.717
Witness, I cannot receive the BBC.

69
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.636
To the left, ITV.

70
00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:59.348
I've taken the band-one coil
from the turret tuner.


71
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.809
- Here we go again.
- My wife always supports me in private.


72
00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:05.187
It is physically impossible for this set

73
00:05:05.312 --> 00:05:08.440
to receive a televisual signal
from the British Broadcasting Corporation.


74
00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:11.485
That negates the imperative on me
to pay the license fee.


75
00:05:11.568 --> 00:05:13.195
I've only got 16 bob here.

76
00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:15.280
- Jackie, fetch the kitty.
- Don't you move.


77
00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:18.075
It's an unfair tax on ordinary people.

78
00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:20.869
Especially the oldies
that can't afford it.


79
00:05:20.994 --> 00:05:24.331
Television, gentlemen,
is the modern cure for loneliness.


80
00:05:24.414 --> 00:05:25.957
- We're a movement.
- I'm not.


81
00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:27.751
Our aim is to persuade our government

82
00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:30.629
that old people
should have free televisual viewing.


83
00:05:30.712 --> 00:05:33.173
The law's the law,
and no one's above it.

84
00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:34.675
Especially a nobody like you.

85
00:05:34.758 --> 00:05:37.427
Oi, you can't talk
to me dad like that in his own house.


86
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.221
- Or what?
- You all right, Kempton?


87
00:05:39.388 --> 00:05:42.557
- Don't know, Barry. Never think about it.
- You back again, stirring it.


88
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:44.059
- Who are you?
- Evening Chronicle.


89
00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:46.687
- Well, by statute...
- "Free TV for the OAP"?


90
00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:48.897
- I like it.
- I was pleased.


91
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.566
- Not a lot rhymes with TV.
- I don't want this in the papers.


92
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.859
He does. That's why I'm here.

93
00:05:52.943 --> 00:05:57.197
Well, by statute, anyone owning
a television needs a license.


94
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.827
But I have modified this set
by removing the BBC call,


95
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.121
so I owe the government nothing.

96
00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:08.917
That is an unarguable proposition,
and certainly sound in law.


97
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.252
Hold it.

98
00:06:14.715 --> 00:06:16.508
- Thank you.
- Now, then, Bunton.


99
00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:31.606
Sorry, Dad.

100
00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:34.901
Where to? Home?

101
00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:35.986
Marian.

102
00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:46.705
Sorry, love.

103
00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:50.417
Porridge.

104
00:06:52.794 --> 00:06:54.087
13 days.

105
00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:58.633
Broke the law.

106
00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:02.804
Upset your mother.

107
00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:04.681
Again.

108
00:07:13.732 --> 00:07:15.358
Why doesn't Mam ever come?

109
00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:18.278
Don't know, Jackie.
You'll have to ask her that yourself.


110
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:28.789
When England faced its Waterloo,
one man stood firm.


111
00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:32.375
This man, Arthur Wellesley,
the Duke of Wellington.


112
00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:35.754
And when last week,
this historic portrait was in danger


113
00:07:35.837 --> 00:07:38.882
of leaving the country forever,
we also stood firm,


114
00:07:38.965 --> 00:07:44.346
raising the £140,000 required
to secure it for us all.


115
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:45.722
Was it really worth it?

116
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:51.353
I mean, looking at it,

117
00:07:51.436 --> 00:07:53.146
it's not very big, is it?

118
00:07:55.357 --> 00:07:56.316
Sir Philip?

119
00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:57.943
Well...

120
00:07:59.152 --> 00:08:04.241
It's an outstanding example
of late-period Goya.


121
00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:06.326
It really is.

122
00:08:06.993 --> 00:08:08.245
Outstanding.

123
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.457
At the National Gallery in London,
the Home Secretary unveiled Goya...


124
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:15.126
This is champion, love. 
Bit of mustard?

125
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.712
You had servants in prison, did you?

126
00:08:17.754 --> 00:08:19.714
You know I don't like getting up.

127
00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:21.383
- I'll get it, Dad.
- No, you won't.


128
00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:25.095
The Iron Duke, I think,
embodies our own national character.


129
00:08:25.178 --> 00:08:28.348
- Courage. Resolve.
- Not the Duke of bloody Wellington.


130
00:08:28.431 --> 00:08:30.058
Refusal to countenance defeat.

131
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:31.852
All the more reason...

132
00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:33.436
I sold one of me boats.

133
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.522
So you didn't go to night class?

134
00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:37.148
Thought you'd be happy for us.

135
00:08:37.232 --> 00:08:39.067
I'd be happier
if you were getting qualified.


136
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.069
What's the armada down to, then?

137
00:08:41.152 --> 00:08:42.237
Just the one left.

138
00:08:42.362 --> 00:08:44.197
At any price, Home Secretary?

139
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:48.034
We're not in the business of putting
a price on the nation's heritage...


140
00:08:48.118 --> 00:08:49.369
They don't have to.

141
00:08:49.452 --> 00:08:52.622
It's the taxpayer, you and me, Jackie,
that's paid for that painting.


142
00:08:52.706 --> 00:08:54.666
Since when have you paid any tax?

143
00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:57.085
Welcome home, Kempton.

144
00:08:57.168 --> 00:09:01.214
You know what's going off here, Jackie?
Toffs looking after their own.


145
00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:04.593
Spending our hard-earned money
on a half-baked portrait,


146
00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:06.136
by some Spanish drunk,

147
00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:10.974
of a duke who was a bastard to his men
and who voted against universal suffrage.


148
00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:11.850
Against what?

149
00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:13.018
The vote.

150
00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:16.354
The Duke of Wellington didn't want you
to have a say in how this country was run


151
00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:17.731
when he was prime minister.

152
00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:19.733
Think what they
could've done with that money.


153
00:09:19.816 --> 00:09:22.652
Given thousands
and thousands of free TV licenses


154
00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:24.571
to war widows and pensioners.

155
00:09:24.654 --> 00:09:27.407
Are these speeches of yours
gonna put food on the table?


156
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.035
You can stop that, Dolly.
I'm back on the taxis tomorrow.


157
00:09:30.118 --> 00:09:32.871
...has yet been taken
bythe British government


158
00:09:32.954 --> 00:09:35.040
on the question of the common market.

159
00:09:35.123 --> 00:09:38.376
"One who hopes."
Translated from what, I couldn't say.


160
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.253
Esperanto, presumably.

161
00:09:40.337 --> 00:09:42.297
I'm not paying for conversation.

162
00:09:42.714 --> 00:09:44.382
I'll keep my trap shut.

163
00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:47.552
In fact, he was a Polish eye doctor.

164
00:09:47.636 --> 00:09:49.304
L.L. Zamenhof.

165
00:09:49.387 --> 00:09:54.309
His dream was to bring humanity together
by means of a universal common language.


166
00:10:03.193 --> 00:10:04.235
Fucking hell.

167
00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:07.197
- What you doing?
- Putting a cabin on it.


168
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.574
Boat building, eh?

169
00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:12.619
Swan Hunter will be shitting themselves.

170
00:10:15.205 --> 00:10:17.624
You gonna live on it? 
Get out the house?

171
00:10:17.707 --> 00:10:19.876
I sell them on as working boats.

172
00:10:22.337 --> 00:10:25.048
- What are you doing home?
- Keeping me head down.


173
00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:26.800
You in trouble?

174
00:10:28.218 --> 00:10:29.260
Not in Newcastle.

175
00:10:32.973 --> 00:10:34.474
Got a little job for you.

176
00:10:37.352 --> 00:10:38.478
I wanna keep me nose clean.

177
00:10:38.561 --> 00:10:39.813
- I'll source the car.
- No.


178
00:10:39.896 --> 00:10:42.023
- You just drive it and get rid of it.
- I said, no.


179
00:10:42.107 --> 00:10:43.900
- You did it before.
- Yeah, and I regret it.


180
00:10:44.985 --> 00:10:46.236
Well, think about it.

181
00:10:47.654 --> 00:10:48.822
A business opportunity.

182
00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:52.826
How's hostilities?

183
00:10:52.909 --> 00:10:55.453
He's writing away,
and Mam's scrubbing the world clean.


184
00:10:58.456 --> 00:10:59.457
Bloody Marian.

185
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:03.336
Aye, bloody Marian.

186
00:11:10.719 --> 00:11:12.387
She normally sleeps through.

187
00:11:12.512 --> 00:11:14.889
It'll be fine. Don't worry.
She knows you. She likes you.


188
00:11:15.557 --> 00:11:16.975
Dorothy, would you mind?

189
00:11:17.642 --> 00:11:18.643
Sorry.

190
00:11:20.353 --> 00:11:22.147
I've always liked this dress.

191
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.858
It's taffeta. I hate it.
It's so uncomfortable.


192
00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:27.861
Darling, it's 7:30 for
8, not 8:30 for 10.

193
00:11:27.944 --> 00:11:30.572
Gordon Bennett. Thank you, Dorothy.

194
00:11:34.034 --> 00:11:36.286
So, what is it tonight?

195
00:11:36.995 --> 00:11:38.246
Golf club gala.

196
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.874
The only time they let the ladies in.

197
00:11:40.957 --> 00:11:42.167
Don't you play there?

198
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.752
Oh, God, no.

199
00:11:43.877 --> 00:11:45.754
It'd be the end of civilization.

200
00:11:47.088 --> 00:11:50.675
So is your husband out?

201
00:11:52.719 --> 00:11:54.846
I mean, back?

202
00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:55.972
I saw the paper.

203
00:11:57.891 --> 00:12:00.143
- Do you want me to stop coming?
- No.


204
00:12:03.354 --> 00:12:05.857
No, no. It's...

205
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.275
It's fine, Dorothy.

206
00:12:08.318 --> 00:12:10.361
We're very happy with you, really.

207
00:12:11.488 --> 00:12:14.574
I don't want to cause
your husband any embarrassment.


208
00:12:14.657 --> 00:12:16.993
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly have that.

209
00:12:17.118 --> 00:12:18.661
My husband the councilor.

210
00:12:21.206 --> 00:12:22.916
It's a real conundrum, though, isn't it?

211
00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.920
I mean, if you can't receive the BBC,

212
00:12:28.755 --> 00:12:30.340
why should you pay the tax?

213
00:12:31.382 --> 00:12:32.509
I'll see you later.

214
00:12:36.596 --> 00:12:37.722
Any time this week.

215
00:12:37.806 --> 00:12:39.641
Doesn't take five minutes
to look like this.


216
00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:40.975
Let's just get going.

217
00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:42.644
- Where's my bag?
- On the ottoman.


218
00:12:42.727 --> 00:12:44.437
- Have you got keys?
- We don't need keys.


219
00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:45.980
- I'm not driving.
- Nobody's driving.


220
00:12:46.648 --> 00:12:50.360
Susan, I'm not going down...

221
00:13:03.706 --> 00:13:05.375
You'd like this one, love.

222
00:13:11.005 --> 00:13:13.716
- Get yourself in there.
- Would you take it easy?


223
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.636
Return of the prodigal son.
Don't give him any money.


224
00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:18.179
I haven't got any.

225
00:13:18.263 --> 00:13:19.639
Where have you two been?

226
00:13:19.764 --> 00:13:21.641
- The Greentree.
- Traitors.


227
00:13:21.724 --> 00:13:24.602
- Are you still barred from there?
- A pint in there isn't a pint.


228
00:13:24.727 --> 00:13:26.521
You could start a
fight in a plowed field.

229
00:13:26.604 --> 00:13:28.940
He accused me
of nicking their toilet rolls.


230
00:13:29.023 --> 00:13:31.568
- You were.
- I was, but he had no evidence.


231
00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:33.403
- Habeas corpus.
- You're an idiot.


232
00:13:33.486 --> 00:13:36.072
- Leave him alone, Mam.
- Fish pie, Kenny? You look thin.


233
00:13:36.156 --> 00:13:37.782
What are you fussing around him for?

234
00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:39.784
For a change from fussing around you.

235
00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:41.536
Babycham for the lady.

236
00:13:41.661 --> 00:13:42.996
Dad, yours.

237
00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:44.247
- Thank you.
- Bottle of brown.


238
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.292
Be sure and use the coasters.
You're not in Leeds.


239
00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.836
- Civilization here.
- You're not in Leeds.


240
00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:52.463
- Put the news on.
- We haven't got a license.


241
00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:55.091
- Whose side are you on?
- My side.


242
00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:57.594
I'm not turning that gogglebox on.

243
00:13:57.677 --> 00:13:58.678
A toast.

244
00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:00.096
To the Buntons.

245
00:14:01.014 --> 00:14:02.307
Happy families.

246
00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.768
- Happy families.
- Fans flock to the National Gallery...


247
00:14:05.894 --> 00:14:08.855
Not that sodding painting again.
National treasure?


248
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.609
It's the poor foot soldiers that won his
battles for him we should be celebrating.


249
00:14:12.692 --> 00:14:15.737
- Kick down every door.
- Quiet.


250
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.781
- That's what doors are there for.
- Quiet.


251
00:14:18.865 --> 00:14:20.366
I hope you're proud of yourself.

252
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.453
They don't swallow what the establishment
tells them. I'm proud of that.


253
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:27.916
- Am I making a bed up for you?
- Aye, couple of nights.


254
00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:30.001
She'll miss you, your dolly bird.

255
00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:33.421
Who we talking about?
Her that's married? Pammy?


256
00:14:33.504 --> 00:14:34.297
She's separated.

257
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.007
If she's not divorced, she's married.

258
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.052
- She was only married two months.
- Don't you go down that road.


259
00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:40.845
I'm the devil incarnate, me.

260
00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:42.931
We don't know anything
about your life in Leeds.


261
00:14:43.014 --> 00:14:44.807
Plenty of cash, never in work.

262
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:47.143
I'm in construction. 
It's seasonal.

263
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.145
You're always welcome here.
Back room's yours.


264
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.898
I wouldn't be surprised
to hear she's in the family way.


265
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:54.651
- Fuck it. I've had enough.
- I'll not have language in this house.


266
00:14:54.776 --> 00:14:57.946
- See you later, Dad. It's been lovely.
- No. I said, you're welcome.


267
00:14:58.029 --> 00:15:00.156
- I'm welcome. I heard you, all right?
- Always.


268
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.367
- I'm never welcome.
- I just don't want any swearing.


269
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.037
- You wonder why I take months away.
- I'll be United Nations.


270
00:15:06.162 --> 00:15:08.331
All I ask is
for you not to swear...

271
00:15:08.414 --> 00:15:11.876
The portrait of the Duke of Wellington
set a record price for a Goya.


272
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.882
It was knocked down to an American
after 90 seconds for £140,000.


273
00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:37.860
I might have the body
of a weak and feeble woman...


274
00:15:37.944 --> 00:15:39.445
Elizabeth I.

275
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.073
but I've got the testicles
of Henry VIII.


276
00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:46.035
You are three and tenpence short
on yesterday, Bunton.


277
00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:47.328
Aye, an old fella.

278
00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:48.371
Skint.

279
00:15:48.454 --> 00:15:49.914
Why's he taking taxis?

280
00:15:49.998 --> 00:15:51.624
He's a war veteran. Can't walk.

281
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:55.545
I am running a
taxi firm, not a charity.

282
00:15:55.628 --> 00:15:58.631
- Take it out me wages.
- I've had complaints.


283
00:15:58.715 --> 00:16:00.675
One, you talk too much,

284
00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:03.094
and, two, it's utter bollocks.

285
00:16:03.177 --> 00:16:05.013
You're sacked, with immediate effect.

286
00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:07.015
I haven't been paid.

287
00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:08.933
Sue me, then.

288
00:16:09.475 --> 00:16:11.185
But fuck off first.

289
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:14.022
Hello. Yes.

290
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:16.399
I'll just take the address, please.

291
00:16:16.482 --> 00:16:17.483
Thank you.

292
00:16:18.234 --> 00:16:19.527
Fuck off.

293
00:16:20.236 --> 00:16:22.739
Thank you very much. 
Be there in a tick.

294
00:16:23.906 --> 00:16:26.034
There is nothing more powerful

295
00:16:26.117 --> 00:16:29.787
than when a community discovers
what it cares about.


296
00:16:30.997 --> 00:16:36.044
And when a man accepts
our essential interdependence...


297
00:16:37.337 --> 00:16:40.340
in that moment he, or she,

298
00:16:40.423 --> 00:16:42.467
becomes a woman.

299
00:16:45.345 --> 00:16:46.346
Or a man.

300
00:16:47.722 --> 00:16:49.557
As the case may be.

301
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.101
How many have you got?

302
00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:55.897
The petition's only
one part of the campaign.


303
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.523
- Three?
- We've just set up.


304
00:16:57.648 --> 00:17:00.777
Kempton Bunton?
That's not even a real name.


305
00:17:04.864 --> 00:17:07.075
Rome wasn't built in a day, Jackie.

306
00:17:07.158 --> 00:17:09.911
But then again,
I wasn't on that particular job.


307
00:17:10.036 --> 00:17:11.079
Oh, hello.

308
00:17:11.162 --> 00:17:13.706
Didn't know you were political,
Jackie Bunton.


309
00:17:14.415 --> 00:17:16.959
Yeah, it's me dad. 
His latest campaign.

310
00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:19.087
Me nan would love a telly.

311
00:17:19.212 --> 00:17:20.963
Why don't you sign my petition, then?

312
00:17:22.924 --> 00:17:24.342
I don't know about that.

313
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.971
The hat suits you.

314
00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:33.226
I'd like to sign, Mr. Bunton.

315
00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:37.730
Unless you have any objections.

316
00:17:37.814 --> 00:17:40.316
Au contraire, Mrs. 
Gowling, au contraire.

317
00:17:41.192 --> 00:17:42.193
Thank you.

318
00:17:42.693 --> 00:17:44.821
Now, where do I put my paw print?

319
00:17:44.904 --> 00:17:46.030
Just there, please.

320
00:17:49.158 --> 00:17:50.993
Give us a hand here, would you?

321
00:17:51.077 --> 00:17:53.079
Quick, get that tarpaulin over it.

322
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.916
- Get the boxes underneath, lad.
- Pull it. Pull it.


323
00:17:56.999 --> 00:18:00.086
Just grab this, would you?
Now grab the other corner.


324
00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:04.298
If Jackie goes to the bad,
I'm holding you responsible.


325
00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:06.592
That'll be the straw, 
I promise you.

326
00:18:06.676 --> 00:18:09.679
You can do your petitions
and write your plays in prison.


327
00:18:09.762 --> 00:18:12.140
They'll do your cooking
and your washing for you and all.


328
00:18:12.223 --> 00:18:14.559
But I've had it. 
I've had it up to here.

329
00:18:21.774 --> 00:18:22.817
Peace offering.

330
00:18:37.206 --> 00:18:39.667
- Good dunkers, them ginger nuts.
- What do you want?


331
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.961
A pact.

332
00:18:44.088 --> 00:18:45.756
Two days in London.

333
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.551
Give me two days.
Then I'll be back for good.


334
00:18:48.634 --> 00:18:50.720
Get a job. Keep me head down.

335
00:18:50.803 --> 00:18:52.972
I didn't come down in the last shower.

336
00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:54.599
Promise. Two days.

337
00:18:56.058 --> 00:18:58.478
To change anything,
you have to go to Parliament.


338
00:18:58.603 --> 00:19:00.480
You're wasting your life.

339
00:19:00.563 --> 00:19:02.273
How do you eat an elephant?

340
00:19:02.773 --> 00:19:03.900
Who eats elephants?

341
00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:06.110
One bite at a time.

342
00:19:06.194 --> 00:19:07.403
Stop this.

343
00:19:08.946 --> 00:19:11.449
Please, Kempton. 
Please, love, please.

344
00:19:14.076 --> 00:19:15.203
I'm begging you.

345
00:19:16.037 --> 00:19:17.747
Stop all your agitation.

346
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.290
Two days, that's all.

347
00:19:19.373 --> 00:19:22.293
If I hit a brick wall down there,
that'll be the end of it.


348
00:19:22.877 --> 00:19:26.464
Two days, that's all I need.
Then I swear it'll be the last of it.


349
00:19:26.547 --> 00:19:28.966
The plays, the politics, the lot.

350
00:19:31.135 --> 00:19:32.136
Two days.

351
00:19:34.472 --> 00:19:35.515
One last chance.

352
00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.125
Do you have an appointment?

353
00:20:03.209 --> 00:20:04.669
He'll want to see me.

354
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:06.462
I'm sorry?

355
00:20:06.546 --> 00:20:08.548
I've sent him my trilogy of plays,

356
00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:12.093
each one tackling
a different aspect of social injustice.


357
00:20:12.176 --> 00:20:13.594
He's not here.

358
00:20:13.678 --> 00:20:14.512
Not here?

359
00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:16.681
He's gone to Granada.

360
00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:18.349
Granada television?

361
00:20:18.432 --> 00:20:20.685
No, Granada in Spain.

362
00:20:21.894 --> 00:20:22.895
I could wait.

363
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:26.232
Right.

364
00:20:35.074 --> 00:20:36.075
Standard!

365
00:20:36.742 --> 00:20:37.827
There you go, sir.

366
00:20:47.545 --> 00:20:49.839
I need to speak
to the boss. It's urgent.

367
00:20:49.922 --> 00:20:50.923
He's over there.

368
00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:53.884
- Sir, I have a story.
- Is that right?


369
00:20:53.968 --> 00:20:55.970
- A campaign.
- I don't do campaigns.


370
00:20:56.053 --> 00:20:58.556
- It's about social injustice.
- I don't do social injustice.


371
00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.141
- Can I buy you...?
- I don't do lunch.


372
00:21:03.227 --> 00:21:04.228
Another time.

373
00:21:10.234 --> 00:21:14.614
Friends, members, citizens
of this great mother of Parliament...


374
00:21:14.697 --> 00:21:16.907
Members, representatives, reps...

375
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:18.784
Friends, reps...

376
00:21:18.868 --> 00:21:20.661
I come here, not...

377
00:21:29.045 --> 00:21:30.171
Friends.

378
00:21:30.963 --> 00:21:32.548
Fellow citizens.

379
00:21:33.132 --> 00:21:35.885
Elected representatives
of this noble house.


380
00:21:36.594 --> 00:21:39.221
- Lend me your ears.
- Let's just move along...


381
00:21:39.347 --> 00:21:43.517
I come not to make a protest,
but to demand of this government...


382
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:44.602
It's all right.

383
00:23:41.677 --> 00:23:42.678
Bugger.

384
00:24:19.215 --> 00:24:22.092
The portrait was missing
when the first shift of attendants


385
00:24:22.176 --> 00:24:24.553
reported for duty here at 7 this morning.

386
00:24:24.637 --> 00:24:28.349
When the gallery closed last night,
the Goya was still in its usual place.


387
00:24:28.474 --> 00:24:31.143
The National Gallery is appealing
to anybody who was here yesterday


388
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.854
and who saw anything
or anybody they think was suspicious


389
00:24:33.938 --> 00:24:35.356
to get in touch with the police.

390
00:24:35.439 --> 00:24:37.149
Is it out of the country, commissioner?

391
00:24:37.274 --> 00:24:41.111
Looking at the degree of planning
and expertise involved,


392
00:24:41.195 --> 00:24:44.323
we're convinced that
the Goya has been stolen to order


393
00:24:44.406 --> 00:24:49.537
by a well-funded, highly professional,
international criminal gang.


394
00:24:50.371 --> 00:24:51.789
Any suspects so far?

395
00:24:51.914 --> 00:24:53.666
It's not very good, is it?

396
00:24:56.502 --> 00:24:57.753
What about the police?

397
00:24:57.795 --> 00:25:00.798
No one's looking
for The Duke of Wellington in Benwell.


398
00:25:01.298 --> 00:25:02.299
- Christ.
- Christ.


399
00:25:02.383 --> 00:25:03.384
Don't touch it.

400
00:25:04.093 --> 00:25:05.761
Jesus Christ.

401
00:25:06.887 --> 00:25:09.014
Christ is the man we need right now.

402
00:25:09.515 --> 00:25:10.391
How come?

403
00:25:10.474 --> 00:25:11.475
Carpenter.

404
00:25:12.017 --> 00:25:14.812
Someone who knows how
to put a false back on that wardrobe.


405
00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:16.480
I can do that.

406
00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:17.731
Get on with it, then.

407
00:25:29.118 --> 00:25:31.287
Next up, communication.

408
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.746
Cut letters out the paper.

409
00:25:32.872 --> 00:25:36.333
No, do that, and you'll be telling them
what paper you read, what glue you've got,


410
00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:38.419
whether you use
right-or left-handed scissors.


411
00:25:38.502 --> 00:25:40.629
That's three coordinates,
and they've got you.


412
00:25:40.754 --> 00:25:43.507
That's why this letter
cannot be posted from Newcastle.


413
00:25:43.591 --> 00:25:45.968
"Query not that I have the Goya.

414
00:25:46.051 --> 00:25:50.514
The act is an attempt to pick the pockets
of those who love art more than charity."


415
00:25:50.598 --> 00:25:53.017
Bit of Robin Hood. Like that.

416
00:25:53.517 --> 00:25:54.810
- Mam.
- Christ.


417
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.357
How was Aunt Betty?

418
00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:02.443
Why are you wearing rubber gloves?

419
00:26:02.526 --> 00:26:04.612
Varnish. Been on the boat.

420
00:26:04.695 --> 00:26:05.654
Hello, pet.

421
00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:08.991
Oh, you're back.
Didn't bring down the government, then?


422
00:26:09.074 --> 00:26:11.785
Oh, well, I exercised my democratic right.

423
00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:14.622
Now it's up to them.
What matters is I'm back.


424
00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:16.874
So you'll be going to the labor exchange.

425
00:26:16.957 --> 00:26:19.460
Tomorrow. First thing.
Shall I put the kettle on?


426
00:26:19.543 --> 00:26:21.837
If you think it'll go with your outfit.

427
00:26:22.504 --> 00:26:26.175
So gonna keep your
name out of the papers?

428
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.804
Aye, there's no reason for me to be
of any interest to the press ever again.


429
00:26:30.888 --> 00:26:32.890
Why are you wearing rubber gloves?

430
00:26:34.433 --> 00:26:35.768
That blocked drain.

431
00:26:35.851 --> 00:26:37.478
We don't have a blocked drain.

432
00:26:37.978 --> 00:26:39.021
Next door's.

433
00:26:39.939 --> 00:26:41.774
We don't talk to next door.

434
00:26:42.274 --> 00:26:43.984
You've gotta build bridges.

435
00:26:50.449 --> 00:26:52.451
Paris, Vienna, then London...

436
00:26:52.534 --> 00:26:53.953
- I'm off.
- Where to?


437
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.663
Rainbow Rooms.

438
00:26:56.455 --> 00:27:00.793
Why in God's name would you want to go
to a club with music, drinking, and girls


439
00:27:00.876 --> 00:27:03.337
when you could stop in
and watch telly with me and your mam?


440
00:27:03.504 --> 00:27:05.297
Don't drink too much
if you're on that bike.


441
00:27:05.381 --> 00:27:08.634
- I'll be careful. See you later, Dad.
- Wear your helmet.


442
00:27:08.717 --> 00:27:12.346
...great appreciation
to the government of Austria...


443
00:27:14.556 --> 00:27:15.557
Now, then.

444
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.685
Oh, no. What have I done?

445
00:27:17.768 --> 00:27:23.482
Kempton Bunton, I want you to swear to me
that you've given up all your nonsense.


446
00:27:23.565 --> 00:27:24.858
I swear.

447
00:27:25.567 --> 00:27:26.443
I swear.

448
00:27:26.568 --> 00:27:27.695
Promise.

449
00:27:27.778 --> 00:27:29.989
Dolly, love, I've learned my lesson.

450
00:27:30.072 --> 00:27:31.323
No more secrets?

451
00:27:31.407 --> 00:27:35.035
Nothing, rien, nada. I promise.

452
00:27:36.203 --> 00:27:40.582
Meanwhile, the hunt
for the missing Goya portrait continues.


453
00:27:40.666 --> 00:27:43.419
I feel I can profile
the thief pretty well.


454
00:27:43.502 --> 00:27:48.048
He's most likely highly physically tuned,
almost certainly a trained commando,


455
00:27:48.132 --> 00:27:49.466
or ex-special forces.

456
00:27:51.677 --> 00:27:52.678
You all right?

457
00:27:52.761 --> 00:27:55.014
Do you expect the criminals
to eventually make contact?


458
00:27:55.097 --> 00:27:56.056
Bit of biscuit.

459
00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.309
We are expecting
some communication from the thieves.


460
00:27:59.393 --> 00:28:01.562
When it comes, we will respond.

461
00:28:05.065 --> 00:28:06.734
You remember Fat Stan?

462
00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:09.695
- Track marshal at the dogs”?
- What?


463
00:28:10.279 --> 00:28:14.658
Well, his brother-in-law,
Gert, nice fella, Dutch,


464
00:28:14.742 --> 00:28:18.829
well, he's foreman
at this plastics injection molding plant.


465
00:28:18.912 --> 00:28:21.498
He said to Fat Stan
that there's a job going.


466
00:28:21.582 --> 00:28:23.000
But it's 10:00 at night.

467
00:28:23.959 --> 00:28:25.169
He's on nights.

468
00:28:25.252 --> 00:28:26.795
Who? Gert or Stan?

469
00:28:27.379 --> 00:28:29.298
Stan. I mean, Gert.

470
00:28:30.382 --> 00:28:31.800
He's night-shift foreman.

471
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.761
At night.

472
00:28:36.472 --> 00:28:39.391
I wouldn't expect I'll be long,
but don't wait up.


473
00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:44.396
- And as the noose tightens...
- Ta-ra.


474
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.939
...around the gang responsible,

475
00:28:46.023 --> 00:28:51.904
the National Gallery announce
a £5000 reward for information...


476
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.208
- How far are you going?
- Morecambe Bay.


477
00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:06.460
Morecambe Bay will be just champion.

478
00:29:12.132 --> 00:29:13.675
Would you like a wine gum?

479
00:31:08.916 --> 00:31:10.000
What are you doing?

480
00:31:12.586 --> 00:31:13.921
Have you read this one?

481
00:31:15.422 --> 00:31:16.590
What's it called?

482
00:31:16.673 --> 00:31:18.091
The Girl on the Bicycle.

483
00:31:19.801 --> 00:31:22.638
No. And I don't think you should either.

484
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:23.764
So you have read it?

485
00:31:24.598 --> 00:31:26.099
He told me what it's about.

486
00:31:26.225 --> 00:31:27.643
Making money out of our grief.

487
00:31:27.726 --> 00:31:29.686
- It's just writing.
- It's wrong.


488
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.522
What else can he do?
You'll never talk about it.


489
00:31:32.606 --> 00:31:35.359
What's there to talk about?
It's done, isn't it?


490
00:31:37.778 --> 00:31:38.737
She's dead.

491
00:31:47.412 --> 00:31:48.580
I'm back.

492
00:31:55.921 --> 00:31:57.673
Where'd you find that?

493
00:31:57.756 --> 00:32:00.050
In the wardrobe in the back room.

494
00:32:00.133 --> 00:32:01.927
What were you doing in there?

495
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.178
I live here.

496
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:18.986
They've got that West Side Story
on at the ABC, Percy Street.


497
00:32:19.069 --> 00:32:20.153
Do you fancy it tomorrow?

498
00:32:20.237 --> 00:32:23.407
We can't afford
to waste money going to the pictures.


499
00:32:35.377 --> 00:32:38.880
It's Romeo and Juliet,
but with singing and dancing,


500
00:32:38.964 --> 00:32:41.883
and it's set in New York,
not Stratford-upon-Avon.


501
00:32:46.847 --> 00:32:48.140
How far have you got?

502
00:32:48.265 --> 00:32:49.224
Far enough.

503
00:32:49.308 --> 00:32:50.267
It's not Marian.

504
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.477
There's a girl dies in a bicycle crash.

505
00:32:52.561 --> 00:32:54.688
That girl's knocked off her bike
by a bus in town.


506
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:57.441
Our Marian came off her bike
going downhill in the country.


507
00:32:57.524 --> 00:32:58.483
Who's read this?

508
00:32:58.567 --> 00:33:00.861
Nobody, I shouldn't think.
I only sent one copy out.


509
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.071
Who to?

510
00:33:03.864 --> 00:33:04.865
Telly.

511
00:33:07.117 --> 00:33:09.703
So the world and his wife's gonna know.

512
00:33:09.786 --> 00:33:12.873
- You've never let me talk about it.
- Grief's private.


513
00:33:12.956 --> 00:33:13.915
I bought her that bike.

514
00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:15.959
If I'd got anything else,
she'd still be alive.


515
00:33:16.043 --> 00:33:17.502
Well, she isn't.

516
00:34:01.588 --> 00:34:02.547
Carry on.

517
00:34:03.465 --> 00:34:05.300
Pedal. That's it. Go on.

518
00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:07.302
Keep going.

519
00:34:10.722 --> 00:34:12.057
Well done.

520
00:34:14.893 --> 00:34:18.730
He's not a writer.
He has pretensions, but he can't write.


521
00:34:19.189 --> 00:34:21.108
- Where was it posted?
- Morecambe.


522
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.318
He's not an educated man.

523
00:34:23.985 --> 00:34:25.821
Could he be Italian?

524
00:34:25.904 --> 00:34:29.199
No, British. Northern.
This comma here tells us a lot.


525
00:34:29.282 --> 00:34:30.283
How do you mean?

526
00:34:31.034 --> 00:34:33.870
It's gratuitous.
It evidences poor education.


527
00:34:33.995 --> 00:34:35.414
He's an autodidact.

528
00:34:35.497 --> 00:34:36.498
A car mechanic?

529
00:34:36.998 --> 00:34:42.003
He's self-taught, over a lifetime.
I'd put him somewhere in his late 50s.


530
00:34:42.087 --> 00:34:45.048
So, what's his mental state, then?

531
00:34:46.258 --> 00:34:50.595
"The act is an attempt to pick the pockets
of those who love art more than charity."


532
00:34:51.138 --> 00:34:53.640
He's a fantasist
who believes he's an idealist.


533
00:34:53.765 --> 00:34:55.308
A kind of Don Quixote.

534
00:34:55.392 --> 00:34:57.769
Oh, the windmill fella.

535
00:34:58.937 --> 00:35:02.274
He'll be active in his community,
known for his local campaigns.


536
00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:05.235
Parking, litter, pub hours,
that sort of thing.


537
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.404
Thank you. That's very helpful.

538
00:35:09.448 --> 00:35:10.449
My pleasure.

539
00:35:12.742 --> 00:35:14.828
- Could someone sign me out?
- I wouldn't dare.


540
00:35:14.911 --> 00:35:17.038
You'd be telling everybody
what I had for breakfast.


541
00:35:23.628 --> 00:35:25.881
- Nice arse.
- You're a married man, Reg.


542
00:35:25.964 --> 00:35:28.008
I can look at the menu
as long as I eat at home.


543
00:35:28.133 --> 00:35:31.553
- So has this fella got the painting?
- Time-wasting bastard.


544
00:35:31.636 --> 00:35:33.513
- He's just after the reward.
- Yeah.


545
00:35:33.597 --> 00:35:35.640
The Italians still favorite, then?

546
00:35:35.724 --> 00:35:37.100
That's where the clever money is.

547
00:35:47.819 --> 00:35:49.112
My first day.

548
00:35:50.071 --> 00:35:51.198
Might be your last.

549
00:35:53.492 --> 00:35:55.911
- Bring it through here.
- No, through there.


550
00:35:56.745 --> 00:35:58.747
This one's full now. That can go.

551
00:35:59.915 --> 00:36:02.292
Watch these ones, man. They're fast.

552
00:36:02.375 --> 00:36:04.085
Get three like bricks, yeah?

553
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.053
In the future,
they'll have robots doing this.


554
00:36:13.136 --> 00:36:14.471
Yeah, I can't wait.

555
00:36:14.554 --> 00:36:17.516
The likes of me and
you will spend our day

556
00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:21.019
developing our minds
with literature and orchestral concerts.


557
00:36:21.102 --> 00:36:22.812
Look, please, just keep up.

558
00:36:23.939 --> 00:36:26.191
Come on, mind your bloomers.

559
00:36:26.274 --> 00:36:29.277
- It's his first day, Mr. Walker.
- Well, you can watch it and all.


560
00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.280
Still getting used
to your lot touching our white loaves.


561
00:36:32.948 --> 00:36:33.949
Yes, sir.

562
00:36:34.366 --> 00:36:35.408
Come on.

563
00:36:41.998 --> 00:36:42.999
Bugger.

564
00:36:54.594 --> 00:36:56.638
Fucking hell. Nothing.

565
00:36:58.098 --> 00:36:59.975
Don't you want them papers, mister?

566
00:37:00.475 --> 00:37:02.394
No, you have them, bonnie lad.

567
00:37:02.477 --> 00:37:06.690
Good firelighters, but you won't find
any of them speaking truth to power.


568
00:37:07.941 --> 00:37:10.068
What you playing, lads? Tip and run?

569
00:37:10.819 --> 00:37:13.280
- Can I have a bowl?
- No, you're all right, pops.


570
00:37:30.755 --> 00:37:31.673
Christ.

571
00:37:47.647 --> 00:37:51.901
You are Kempton Bunton,
and I claim me £5000 reward.


572
00:37:52.027 --> 00:37:54.195
Daft bugger. I nearly shit myself.

573
00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:56.406
Why'd you open it up?

574
00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:58.116
No reaction to my first communication,

575
00:37:58.325 --> 00:38:01.703
so I took the ticket off the back,
proof positive that I've got it.


576
00:38:01.786 --> 00:38:04.873
This to the working man's paper,
The Daily Mirror.


577
00:38:06.374 --> 00:38:08.418
- Mam.
- Quick, sort this lot out.


578
00:38:08.501 --> 00:38:09.502
What?

579
00:38:16.926 --> 00:38:18.470
And round about 11

580
00:38:18.595 --> 00:38:19.763
My idea of heaven

581
00:38:19.846 --> 00:38:22.849
Is a nice cup of tea

582
00:38:22.932 --> 00:38:24.100
I like a nice cup of tea...

583
00:38:24.184 --> 00:38:26.895
Stop it, you daft brush.
Anyhow, it's half 3.


584
00:38:26.978 --> 00:38:28.897
You were a beautiful dancer.

585
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.148
Graceful, fluid.

586
00:38:30.273 --> 00:38:32.317
- I wasn't that good.
- You were that good.


587
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.902
Ginger Rogers of Whitley Bay.

588
00:38:33.985 --> 00:38:36.279
I always said
we should've entered them competitions.


589
00:38:36.363 --> 00:38:37.614
We'd never have won.

590
00:38:37.697 --> 00:38:38.782
Swept the board.

591
00:38:40.116 --> 00:38:42.827
You're looking
at Hollisons' new star baker.


592
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:44.579
Hollisons? I thought it was plastics.

593
00:38:44.663 --> 00:38:46.706
No, I'm Lord Bunton of the baps.

594
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.459
Number two oven man.
Much better. You can't eat plastic.


595
00:38:49.542 --> 00:38:50.543
So will it be regular?

596
00:38:50.627 --> 00:38:53.880
Aye, I've taken to it
like a swan to water.


597
00:38:53.963 --> 00:38:55.674
And a free loaf every day.

598
00:38:56.508 --> 00:38:58.802
- Tomorrow, a pork pie.
- Pork pie?


599
00:38:58.885 --> 00:39:00.762
- Slightly damaged.
- You're slightly damaged.


600
00:39:00.887 --> 00:39:03.431
Today, a 14-ounce Danish.

601
00:39:04.683 --> 00:39:06.101
Slightly damaged?

602
00:39:06.184 --> 00:39:09.229
Light and airy,
for ladies who are watching their figure.


603
00:39:09.354 --> 00:39:10.397
I'm not, though, am 1?

604
00:39:10.522 --> 00:39:12.732
You're better off wobbling than rattling.

605
00:39:13.441 --> 00:39:16.611
I like a nice cup
of tea in the morning

606
00:39:16.695 --> 00:39:19.155
I like a nice cup
of tea with my tea...

607
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.013
Jackie Bunton, is this your idea
of a Saturday night out?


608
00:39:44.097 --> 00:39:46.474
Just wait, would you? 
Come on, follow me.

609
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.561
Jackie.

610
00:39:51.479 --> 00:39:52.689
What are you doing?

611
00:39:52.772 --> 00:39:54.274
Madam care to view?

612
00:40:03.158 --> 00:40:04.159
Gosh.

613
00:40:07.328 --> 00:40:08.455
What do you think?

614
00:40:10.206 --> 00:40:11.207
Yours, are they?

615
00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:13.626
One day, aye.

616
00:40:14.961 --> 00:40:16.713
Are we gonna be millionaires?

617
00:40:19.924 --> 00:40:21.384
That's what I wanna do.

618
00:40:23.136 --> 00:40:24.888
Build boats like this.

619
00:40:25.555 --> 00:40:26.556
On the Tyne?

620
00:40:27.891 --> 00:40:28.892
Nah.

621
00:40:29.476 --> 00:40:33.313
California, New Zealand, Australia.

622
00:40:35.815 --> 00:40:37.317
You just wanna get away.

623
00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:46.826
Mam wants me to wear a shirt and tie,
and Dad wants me to punch the pope.


624
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:49.329
What's the pope done to upset your dad?

625
00:40:50.205 --> 00:40:52.957
The pope, prime minister...

626
00:41:13.353 --> 00:41:18.107
Dolly, love, it's bad enough me having to
get up at the crack of a sparrow's fart.


627
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:20.026
- But you...
- Don't mind.


628
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:24.656
A full English breakfast,
served by an Irish rose.


629
00:41:24.823 --> 00:41:26.032
Eat up. You're late.

630
00:41:26.491 --> 00:41:29.577
That's the shipping ticket that
was attached to the back of the Goya.


631
00:41:29.661 --> 00:41:31.621
And he sent it to...?

632
00:41:31.704 --> 00:41:33.456
The Daily Mirror, 
Home Secretary.

633
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.208
So an arrest is imminent?

634
00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:37.418
Not as such.

635
00:41:38.336 --> 00:41:40.672
But we know where this note was posted?

636
00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:42.298
Oh, Central Birmingham.

637
00:41:42.382 --> 00:41:43.675
The Italians?

638
00:41:45.093 --> 00:41:48.805
We're reevaluating
that aspect of the inquiry, sir.


639
00:41:48.888 --> 00:41:52.433
But we can pinpoint precisely
the whereabouts of this person?


640
00:41:53.142 --> 00:41:56.980
We're pretty sure he resides
between Morecambe and Birmingham,


641
00:41:57.105 --> 00:42:00.066
and has traveled in that area
at some time for work.


642
00:42:00.191 --> 00:42:03.236
So he could be one
of about 23 million people?


643
00:42:04.362 --> 00:42:07.282
If he's still in the area, yes, sir.

644
00:42:08.908 --> 00:42:09.742
"The Duke is safe,

645
00:42:09.826 --> 00:42:12.912
his temperature cared for,
his future uncertain.


646
00:42:12.996 --> 00:42:15.540
We ask that
some nonconformist type of person


647
00:42:15.665 --> 00:42:17.417
with the sportitude of a Billy Butlin

648
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.378
and the fearless fortitude
of a Montgomery..."


649
00:42:20.461 --> 00:42:23.298
Sportitude, fortitude.
The man's a bloody poet.


650
00:42:23.381 --> 00:42:26.009
Perhaps we can lock W.H. 
Auden up at last.

651
00:42:26.092 --> 00:42:27.886
What's he actually asking for?

652
00:42:31.598 --> 00:42:35.101
One hundred and forty thousand pounds,
Home Secretary.


653
00:42:35.184 --> 00:42:36.477
Good grief.

654
00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:37.562
For what?

655
00:42:37.645 --> 00:42:38.479
Charity.

656
00:42:38.563 --> 00:42:39.898
As yet unspecified.

657
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.983
Clearly a lunatic.

658
00:42:42.108 --> 00:42:44.193
Well, we will follow any credible...

659
00:42:44.277 --> 00:42:45.862
- Be quiet, Macpherson.
- Sir.


660
00:42:45.945 --> 00:42:48.615
Gentlemen,
I'm fully prepared for martyrdom,


661
00:42:48.698 --> 00:42:50.742
but I would rather like it delayed.

662
00:42:50.825 --> 00:42:53.328
And you chaps,
I believe, need to keep your jobs.


663
00:42:53.453 --> 00:42:55.079
We'll meet again in 48 hours,

664
00:42:55.163 --> 00:42:58.374
when you will tell me
of the very significant progress


665
00:42:58.458 --> 00:43:01.544
you've made
in solving this extremely serious crime.


666
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.338
Yes, Home Secretary.

667
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:23.191
I'm back.

668
00:43:25.526 --> 00:43:26.861
Where have you been?

669
00:43:28.363 --> 00:43:30.323
Large white sliced.

670
00:43:30.406 --> 00:43:31.616
Slightly damaged.

671
00:43:35.912 --> 00:43:37.205
This came for you.

672
00:43:41.084 --> 00:43:43.044
The BBC. The play.

673
00:43:43.753 --> 00:43:45.964
The one that's not about the accident.

674
00:43:46.047 --> 00:43:50.551
They'll be wanting me to go down
to London to supervise the production.


675
00:43:54.055 --> 00:43:56.140
"Thank you for giving the Drama Department

676
00:43:56.224 --> 00:43:59.352
the opportunity
of reading your intriguing play.


677
00:44:00.478 --> 00:44:05.733
Unfortunately it is difficult to find
an audience for plays about grief."


678
00:44:10.029 --> 00:44:13.741
Whoever they get to read plays
can't be writers, that's all I can say.


679
00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:18.037
Well, whoever they are...

680
00:44:19.414 --> 00:44:21.624
Well, maybe it's best they've said no.

681
00:44:27.088 --> 00:44:28.089
Aye.

682
00:44:34.387 --> 00:44:35.388
What's for tea?

683
00:44:36.055 --> 00:44:38.182
- Sausage and mash.
- Grand.


684
00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.351
Prial of kings.

685
00:44:42.103 --> 00:44:43.104
Akqua.

686
00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.691
What a steaming pile of shite.

687
00:44:49.318 --> 00:44:50.570
Prial of aces.

688
00:44:50.653 --> 00:44:51.946
What? No.

689
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.322
There he is.

690
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.951
I might have known. Mr. Akram.

691
00:44:57.035 --> 00:44:59.037
- You still on Paki time?
- No, sir.


692
00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.872
- You had your ten minutes.
- Sorry, sir.


693
00:45:00.955 --> 00:45:03.458
- Let him finish the game.
- You what?


694
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:05.376
Me and Javid broke at the same time.

695
00:45:05.501 --> 00:45:07.587
- Kempton, please, it don't matter.
- It does matter.


696
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.881
We get a 15-minute break.
We've only had nine minutes.


697
00:45:10.006 --> 00:45:11.799
You don't understand.
It's different for me...


698
00:45:11.883 --> 00:45:14.719
Are you accusing me
of racialist discrimination?


699
00:45:14.802 --> 00:45:16.679
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey.


700
00:45:16.763 --> 00:45:18.473
I like Pakis, me.

701
00:45:18.556 --> 00:45:20.058
If it wasn't for your lot,

702
00:45:20.141 --> 00:45:23.853
I wouldn't be able to get
a pint of milk on Christmas morning.


703
00:45:25.063 --> 00:45:27.023
I going back up now, sir.

704
00:45:27.732 --> 00:45:28.983
Sit down, Bunton.

705
00:45:30.068 --> 00:45:31.569
You can finish your game.

706
00:45:31.652 --> 00:45:35.823
"I will not let anyone walk
through my mind with their dirty feet."


707
00:45:35.907 --> 00:45:37.492
Mahatma Gandhi.

708
00:45:41.621 --> 00:45:42.622
Well...

709
00:45:42.914 --> 00:45:45.333
that is brilliant, that is.

710
00:45:46.125 --> 00:45:47.877
I'll tell you what, Bunton.

711
00:45:47.919 --> 00:45:50.755
Get your card, clock off, and fuck off.

712
00:45:51.464 --> 00:45:53.674
You can have
as long a break as you want, then.


713
00:46:05.228 --> 00:46:07.480
Can I have one
of them pork pies, pet?

714
00:46:07.605 --> 00:46:10.525
- Yeah, one pork pie. Anything else?
- No, thank you.


715
00:46:12.652 --> 00:46:14.862
Can you just damage it a bit, please?

716
00:46:15.571 --> 00:46:18.574
- Damage it?
- Just chip a bit of pastry off the side.


717
00:46:20.618 --> 00:46:21.452
I can.

718
00:46:21.536 --> 00:46:22.537
Thank you.

719
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:31.671
Rag and bone!

720
00:46:40.388 --> 00:46:43.015
Just a pub. A stupid, petty crime.

721
00:46:48.229 --> 00:46:49.188
Where were you?

722
00:46:50.439 --> 00:46:51.983
What's your answer to that?

723
00:46:57.029 --> 00:46:58.239
What you doing here?

724
00:46:58.322 --> 00:47:00.158
Stopping over for a couple of nights, Dad.

725
00:47:00.283 --> 00:47:01.617
This is Pammy.

726
00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:03.244
Hi, Mr. Bunton.

727
00:47:03.911 --> 00:47:04.829
What do you want?

728
00:47:04.912 --> 00:47:06.789
Talking to your lad.

729
00:47:06.873 --> 00:47:07.999
In a bedroom?

730
00:47:08.082 --> 00:47:09.959
Well, when we knocked on the front door,

731
00:47:10.042 --> 00:47:12.712
Pamela here
didn't think your Kenny was at home.


732
00:47:12.837 --> 00:47:15.089
But would you believe it,
we found him up here.


733
00:47:15.173 --> 00:47:17.800
- Shall we all go downstairs?
- We're all right.


734
00:47:18.759 --> 00:47:22.096
Kenny should've given evidence
yesterday at Leeds Crown Court.


735
00:47:22.263 --> 00:47:23.514
But he did a runner.

736
00:47:23.973 --> 00:47:24.932
What you done?

737
00:47:25.016 --> 00:47:28.519
Me? Nothing.
They want me to grass up a pal of mine.


738
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:31.063
You need a witness summons.

739
00:47:31.147 --> 00:47:33.399
Has everyone in this family
got a law degree?


740
00:47:33.482 --> 00:47:37.653
I'm not legally qualified as such.
I'm more a talented amateur.


741
00:47:37.737 --> 00:47:39.614
One witness summons.

742
00:47:39.697 --> 00:47:41.365
Leeds Crown Court.

743
00:47:41.449 --> 00:47:42.700
Thursday.

744
00:47:42.783 --> 00:47:43.826
Thank you.

745
00:47:44.493 --> 00:47:45.870
We'll see ourselves out.

746
00:47:46.913 --> 00:47:47.955
Ta-ra, boys.

747
00:47:48.831 --> 00:47:49.832
Ta-ra.

748
00:47:53.294 --> 00:47:55.922
You can't stay in this room.
I write in here.


749
00:47:57.089 --> 00:47:58.799
Mam said it'd be all right.

750
00:47:58.925 --> 00:47:59.926
Where is she?

751
00:48:00.009 --> 00:48:01.594
Shops. I give her some money.

752
00:48:02.136 --> 00:48:04.096
Not enough dinner now we're here.

753
00:48:05.139 --> 00:48:08.309
Dinner's what they have down south.
Up here, it's tea.


754
00:48:09.852 --> 00:48:12.939
I'm against hanging on principle,
unless it's for something really serious.


755
00:48:13.022 --> 00:48:14.815
That doesn't even make sense.

756
00:48:14.899 --> 00:48:16.317
Are you saying I'm thick?

757
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.818
You know you're thick.

758
00:48:17.902 --> 00:48:20.154
Kenny's mate stole a car, Dolly.

759
00:48:20.238 --> 00:48:22.114
He won't be hung for that.

760
00:48:22.198 --> 00:48:23.157
Hanged.

761
00:48:25.493 --> 00:48:26.827
It's "hanged."

762
00:48:32.166 --> 00:48:34.835
- I love your toad-in-the-hole, Mam.
- Thank you, Jackie.


763
00:48:35.503 --> 00:48:37.838
So, Pamela,

764
00:48:37.922 --> 00:48:39.966
what is your current domestic situation?

765
00:48:40.049 --> 00:48:41.425
Give it a rest, Mam.

766
00:48:41.509 --> 00:48:43.427
I work for Mrs. Gowling.

767
00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:46.597
That's the wife of Councilor Gowling.
You may have heard of him.


768
00:48:46.681 --> 00:48:49.600
- What's it got to do with him?
- The difference between right and wrong.


769
00:48:49.725 --> 00:48:50.726
Dad.

770
00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:52.561
I agree with your mother.

771
00:48:52.645 --> 00:48:55.439
It would be wrong for you two
to be living in sin under our roof.


772
00:48:55.523 --> 00:48:57.191
What's happened to you?

773
00:48:57.316 --> 00:48:58.901
You'll be voting Tory next.

774
00:49:02.154 --> 00:49:04.323
Play for Today's on in five minutes.

775
00:49:05.366 --> 00:49:06.701
We can't get BBC.

776
00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:08.244
Why not?

777
00:49:08.327 --> 00:49:10.246
Dad took the band-one coil out.

778
00:49:10.329 --> 00:49:13.791
If you can't get the BBC,
you don't have to have a license.


779
00:49:13.874 --> 00:49:16.127
But you've got one sellotaped
to your television.


780
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:17.295
No, we haven't.

781
00:49:17.378 --> 00:49:18.379
That's mine.

782
00:49:20.131 --> 00:49:21.716
What did you do that for?

783
00:49:22.466 --> 00:49:23.968
To be normal.

784
00:49:24.051 --> 00:49:25.636
Just fit the gizmo back in, then.

785
00:49:27.054 --> 00:49:28.681
Dad's lost the coil.

786
00:49:28.764 --> 00:49:31.809
So you pay for a television license,
and you still can't receive BBC?


787
00:49:31.892 --> 00:49:33.686
We don't like Play for Today.

788
00:49:33.811 --> 00:49:36.439
It's just an excuse
for a lot of bad behavior.


789
00:49:40.609 --> 00:49:42.278
Have you set your alarm, love?

790
00:49:42.945 --> 00:49:44.030
What for?

791
00:49:44.113 --> 00:49:45.948
Aren't you 6 to 2 tomorrow?

792
00:49:46.824 --> 00:49:48.242
Aye, aye, you're right.

793
00:49:49.952 --> 00:49:50.911
Belt and braces.

794
00:49:50.995 --> 00:49:53.331
- Sandwich loaf tomorrow, if you can.
- No problem.


795
00:49:53.456 --> 00:49:54.749
Will you piss off?

796
00:49:55.333 --> 00:49:56.459
Language!

797
00:49:57.251 --> 00:49:58.836
She's got a nerve.

798
00:49:59.545 --> 00:50:01.714
Count your blessings they're only arguing.

799
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.182
Meet the Quality Street gang,
sizing up the works of art.


800
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:13.559
The Boss. Very smooth.

801
00:50:13.642 --> 00:50:15.102
But inside he's a hard nut.

802
00:50:15.186 --> 00:50:17.271
And Fingers. Slim, elegant Fingers.

803
00:50:17.355 --> 00:50:19.148
Everything he touches...

804
00:50:19.732 --> 00:50:23.235
It must have been a great source
of anxiety to the National Gallery staff.


805
00:50:23.319 --> 00:50:25.237
Have you ever had
a painting stolen before?


806
00:50:25.321 --> 00:50:26.155
Never.

807
00:50:26.238 --> 00:50:28.616
Not since the gallery opened in 1824.

808
00:50:36.874 --> 00:50:39.668
What's your present thinking
about the thieves?


809
00:50:39.752 --> 00:50:44.382
We don't think that they were professional
criminals in the strict sense...


810
00:50:44.465 --> 00:50:46.133
- Doll?
- What?


811
00:50:46.258 --> 00:50:47.551
...misguided people...

812
00:50:48.094 --> 00:50:50.596
- What?
- They spoke of charity in their note.


813
00:50:50.679 --> 00:50:51.472
Nothing.

814
00:50:51.597 --> 00:50:54.809
The best form of charity they could do
would be to return the picture...


815
00:51:18.582 --> 00:51:19.625
Oh, yeah.

816
00:51:21.377 --> 00:51:22.711
You like that, I'll say.

817
00:51:41.689 --> 00:51:42.690
I need a piss.

818
00:51:43.441 --> 00:51:45.484
And I thought you were Cary Grant.

819
00:52:26.192 --> 00:52:27.526
You beauty.

820
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.694
Dad.

821
00:52:28.777 --> 00:52:30.446
Three horse accumulator!

822
00:52:30.529 --> 00:52:31.489
Twenty quid!

823
00:52:31.572 --> 00:52:33.949
The Mirror. They're making you an offer.

824
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.954
I give them the painting,
they put on an exhibition,


825
00:52:39.038 --> 00:52:40.623
charge the public to see The Duke.

826
00:52:40.706 --> 00:52:43.083
And give me the proceeds. Bingo.

827
00:52:43.167 --> 00:52:44.793
How much will an exhibition raise?

828
00:52:44.835 --> 00:52:47.630
Thirty thousand, 50,000. Who knows?

829
00:52:47.755 --> 00:52:49.924
The painting's not been out the news.

830
00:52:50.466 --> 00:52:54.303
I'll be able to pay for
God knows how many TV licenses.


831
00:52:54.803 --> 00:52:57.139
You're not really gonna
use it all on telly licenses?


832
00:52:57.223 --> 00:52:58.349
Why not?

833
00:52:58.432 --> 00:53:01.685
Just saying, who couldn't
make use of a couple of grand?


834
00:53:01.769 --> 00:53:04.438
- You think Robin Hood took a rake-off?
- Aye.


835
00:53:04.522 --> 00:53:06.273
Jackie. Robin Hood?

836
00:53:07.149 --> 00:53:08.901
What if they're in it with the coppers?

837
00:53:08.984 --> 00:53:12.363
You give them the painting,
they don't cough up, and they shop you.


838
00:53:12.988 --> 00:53:13.989
The Mirror?

839
00:53:14.865 --> 00:53:17.159
This is the workers' paper, Jackie lad.

840
00:53:17.243 --> 00:53:18.953
How are you gonna get them the painting?

841
00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.540
I'll worry about that tomorrow.
Tonight, celebration.


842
00:53:22.623 --> 00:53:23.874
Fish supper, family outing.

843
00:53:23.999 --> 00:53:26.418
No, but, Dad, Irene's coming round.

844
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.462
The more the merrier. 
Bring her along.

845
00:53:29.713 --> 00:53:33.133
So, Mrs. Bunton,
how did you and Mr. Bunton meet?


846
00:53:33.259 --> 00:53:35.177
In his mother's pub in Tynemouth.

847
00:53:35.302 --> 00:53:37.263
He wiped me table four times.

848
00:53:37.346 --> 00:53:39.014
It worked. You came back.

849
00:53:39.848 --> 00:53:42.184
When she saw he was sweet on me,
his mother said,


850
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:44.562
"Some of his faults are good faults."

851
00:53:44.645 --> 00:53:47.231
Why can't we go to the seaside?
How far's Tynemouth?


852
00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:50.067
You wouldn't wanna be dragged
by your balls from here to Tynemouth.


853
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:52.194
Kenneth, language.

854
00:53:52.278 --> 00:53:55.072
Irene's new to the family,
and she hasn't been married.


855
00:53:55.155 --> 00:53:58.242
No, I'm still looking
for me Prince Charming.


856
00:53:58.325 --> 00:54:00.286
Good luck finding him in Benwell.

857
00:54:00.369 --> 00:54:01.829
Benwell Village.

858
00:54:01.912 --> 00:54:03.122
You're so posh, Mam.

859
00:54:03.706 --> 00:54:05.749
Here, we'll carry you.

860
00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:08.210
No, don't! Oh, my God!

861
00:54:08.335 --> 00:54:11.672
- Carriage for the queen.
- Stop it. You're daft in the head.


862
00:54:11.797 --> 00:54:14.091
Make way for the queen. Here she is.

863
00:54:14.174 --> 00:54:16.635
- Go on, Queen of Benwell Village.
- Wave to the public.


864
00:54:22.308 --> 00:54:24.268
Four pie and chips, two cod and chips,

865
00:54:24.351 --> 00:54:27.396
mushy peas, three,
and two pots of tea, please.


866
00:54:27.479 --> 00:54:29.106
- Four pie and chips.
- Hello, pet.


867
00:54:29.189 --> 00:54:30.691
Two cod and chips. 
Three mushy peas.

868
00:54:30.774 --> 00:54:32.443
- Two pots of tea.
- I'm going for a piss.


869
00:54:32.526 --> 00:54:34.320
On second thought, 
I'd prefer a lemonade.

870
00:54:34.403 --> 00:54:37.031
- And a lemonade, please, pet.
- And a lemonade.


871
00:54:37.114 --> 00:54:38.949
- Anything else?
- What you gonna do with it?


872
00:54:39.033 --> 00:54:40.284
- What?
- The painting.


873
00:54:41.827 --> 00:54:43.704
- What painting?
- I don't know.


874
00:54:43.787 --> 00:54:47.249
The painting of the Duke of Wellington
by Francisco José de Goya.


875
00:54:49.752 --> 00:54:50.753
What are you suggesting?

876
00:54:50.836 --> 00:54:53.714
I'm suggesting that if you were
to move the painting somewhere neutral,


877
00:54:53.797 --> 00:54:55.090
safe, out the house,

878
00:54:55.174 --> 00:54:59.428
I could tell the authorities where it is,
and we could split the 5000 reward.


879
00:54:59.553 --> 00:55:00.346
Or?

880
00:55:00.429 --> 00:55:04.975
Or you can hang on to it, and one day,
some very public-minded citizen


881
00:55:05.059 --> 00:55:07.561
tells the police everything,
and gets all the money.


882
00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:09.146
But we wouldn't want that to happen.

883
00:55:09.271 --> 00:55:12.191
Because I like you,
and you would have to go to prison.


884
00:55:12.816 --> 00:55:14.443
- Two and half thousand?
- Each.


885
00:55:15.152 --> 00:55:18.030
- I can't do what I need to do with that.
- What do you wanna do?


886
00:55:18.739 --> 00:55:19.573
Help people.

887
00:55:19.657 --> 00:55:21.116
Help yourself more like.

888
00:55:22.201 --> 00:55:24.870
- Are you short of money?
- Who isn't?


889
00:55:29.541 --> 00:55:30.668
She knows about it.

890
00:55:31.293 --> 00:55:32.252
What?

891
00:55:32.336 --> 00:55:33.337
The Duke.

892
00:55:33.962 --> 00:55:35.964
- Who? Mam?
- Pammy. She's after the reward money.


893
00:55:36.048 --> 00:55:38.509
- Wants to split it with me.
- What about the Mirror offer?


894
00:55:38.592 --> 00:55:41.387
I know, but if she goes
to the police now, we're done for.


895
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:44.014
If I take it back tonight,
maybe they'll go easy on me.


896
00:55:46.433 --> 00:55:48.852
- What'll you tell Mam?
- What can I tell her?


897
00:55:48.936 --> 00:55:51.230
Here, I'm gonna slip back.
Keep them entertained.


898
00:55:51.355 --> 00:55:54.733
- What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know. Take them to the Greentree.


899
00:56:06.161 --> 00:56:07.121
Kempton?

900
00:56:28.642 --> 00:56:29.685
I can explain.

901
00:56:34.648 --> 00:56:35.858
Oh, my good God.

902
00:56:43.574 --> 00:56:44.616
It was you?

903
00:56:46.702 --> 00:56:48.620
You stole the painting?

904
00:56:48.704 --> 00:56:50.581
It's not theft for money.

905
00:56:50.706 --> 00:56:53.417
It's, you know, for the campaign.

906
00:56:56.295 --> 00:56:57.296
You're a madman.

907
00:56:58.797 --> 00:57:00.382
I'm living with a madman.

908
00:57:01.675 --> 00:57:03.177
But you swore to me. You promised.

909
00:57:03.302 --> 00:57:06.096
- If you've involved our Jackie...
- Jackie's had nothing to do with it.


910
00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.056
Why's he wearing rubber gloves
half the time?


911
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.434
- He helped me build the panel.
- So he is involved?


912
00:57:10.517 --> 00:57:13.979
He hasn't touched the painting
without rubber gloves on.


913
00:57:15.105 --> 00:57:16.231
I'm shaking.

914
00:57:16.315 --> 00:57:17.232
It's the shock.

915
00:57:17.316 --> 00:57:20.360
Yes, I'm shocked there's
a stolen masterpiece in me wardrobe.


916
00:57:20.444 --> 00:57:21.570
I'm taking it back.

917
00:57:22.237 --> 00:57:23.530
Anything else I need to know?

918
00:57:24.948 --> 00:57:27.618
- I lost me job at the bakery.
- There's a surprise.


919
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:30.454
- I stood up against racial bigotry.
- Well done.


920
00:57:30.579 --> 00:57:32.206
Someone had to say something.

921
00:57:32.331 --> 00:57:35.292
He's called Martin Luther bloody King,
not Kempton Bunton.


922
00:57:35.375 --> 00:57:37.294
You swore you'd get a job.

923
00:57:38.086 --> 00:57:40.088
We had an agreement.

924
00:57:40.172 --> 00:57:41.673
You lied.

925
00:57:42.633 --> 00:57:45.135
You lied
when you said all this would stop.


926
00:57:45.219 --> 00:57:48.514
You don't care, do you?
It's just me, me, me, isn't it?


927
00:57:48.597 --> 00:57:49.932
No one else exists.

928
00:57:51.391 --> 00:57:52.768
Pammy knows I've got it.

929
00:57:54.394 --> 00:57:55.646
Oh, heavens.

930
00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:59.191
There's a reward, 5000.
She's after the money. So then...


931
00:57:59.274 --> 00:58:01.235
- She'll go to the police.
- It's possible, but...


932
00:58:01.318 --> 00:58:03.570
- And they'll come here.
- Only ifit's...


933
00:58:03.737 --> 00:58:06.907
In the street.
They'll drag you out in handcuffs.


934
00:58:07.032 --> 00:58:08.283
Listen, calm down.

935
00:58:08.367 --> 00:58:10.994
I can't calm down! 
I'm at top pitch!

936
00:58:11.078 --> 00:58:15.082
I'm taking the painting
back to London tonight quietly.


937
00:58:15.207 --> 00:58:18.168
That would be the best thing for us.
For all of us.


938
00:58:18.293 --> 00:58:19.837
I might have to
do a bit of time...

939
00:58:19.962 --> 00:58:22.840
It's a £140,000 painting. 
You'll do life.

940
00:58:22.923 --> 00:58:24.174
No, love, it's not like that.

941
00:58:24.299 --> 00:58:28.178
I was gonna use it for,
you know, the greater good of mankind.


942
00:58:28.262 --> 00:58:30.973
Mankind? What about your own kind?

943
00:58:31.473 --> 00:58:35.060
You've broken this family.
You're disgusting.


944
00:58:35.143 --> 00:58:36.478
Get out, you bastard.

945
00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.063
Go on, get out.

946
00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:50.742
Dad.

947
00:58:51.368 --> 00:58:53.287
Dad, I'm coming with you.

948
00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:54.830
No, you're not. 
This is my thing.

949
00:58:54.955 --> 00:58:56.248
- But...
- Nothing to do with you.


950
00:58:56.331 --> 00:58:58.417
Now stay and look after your mother.

951
00:59:49.009 --> 00:59:50.010
Excuse me, sir.

952
00:59:51.428 --> 00:59:53.430
Are you taking one of our paintings?

953
00:59:54.222 --> 00:59:56.391
No, son. I'm bringing one back.

954
00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.021
Meanwhile, in an unexpected development,

955
01:00:01.104 --> 01:00:04.024
Goya's portrait of
the Duke of Wellington has been returned,


956
01:00:04.107 --> 01:00:08.070
by hand, to where it was stolen
from London's National Gallery.


957
01:00:08.153 --> 01:00:11.406
At a press conference, an official
described how a member of the public


958
01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:14.785
had simply walked in off the streets
with the painting under his arm,


959
01:00:14.868 --> 01:00:17.245
wrapped up in a
bit of old brown paper.

960
01:00:17.371 --> 01:00:20.666
And when our reporter tried it,
nobody batted an eyelid.


961
01:00:20.749 --> 01:00:23.168
Devlin looked down from his bench
and said, "Mr. Hutchinson.


962
01:00:23.293 --> 01:00:25.003
Are you trying
to show this court contempt?"


963
01:00:25.128 --> 01:00:27.839
I said, "My lord, no,
I'm actually trying to hide it."


964
01:00:28.507 --> 01:00:31.093
First rule of advocacy,
don't be funnier than the judge.


965
01:00:31.218 --> 01:00:32.010
Yes.

966
01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:35.013
Mr. Bunton, I'm your barrister,
Jeremy Hutchinson.


967
01:00:35.639 --> 01:00:38.725
That's a shame. I thought you
were going to offer me a gin and tonic.


968
01:00:39.393 --> 01:00:42.604
Well, I'm out tonight.
My wife is in The Cherry Orchard.


969
01:00:43.063 --> 01:00:44.356
Playing Ranevskaya?

970
01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:45.899
Indeed.

971
01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:50.946
Like life, I can never decide if
The Cherry Orchard is a tragedy or farce.


972
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:52.072
You know the play?

973
01:00:52.739 --> 01:00:54.157
It's one of me favorites.

974
01:00:54.282 --> 01:00:55.784
I lost a child myself.

975
01:00:56.785 --> 01:00:57.744
I'm sorry.

976
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:59.830
I'm a playwright.

977
01:01:00.497 --> 01:01:02.749
As a matter of fact,
I prefer Chekhov to Shakespeare.


978
01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:05.544
For me, the Bard
is overfond of his kings.

979
01:01:05.627 --> 01:01:07.587
Eric Crowther. 
Junior counsel.

980
01:01:07.671 --> 01:01:10.674
Mr. Hutchinson's wife
is the actress Dame Peggy Ashcroft.


981
01:01:10.757 --> 01:01:11.758
Yes.

982
01:01:12.968 --> 01:01:14.511
You're a lucky man.

983
01:01:14.594 --> 01:01:15.595
Well...

984
01:01:16.555 --> 01:01:17.848
Court number one, eh?

985
01:01:18.473 --> 01:01:19.808
The Old Bailey.

986
01:01:19.891 --> 01:01:22.310
The crucible of British criminal justice.

987
01:01:22.394 --> 01:01:23.562
Dr. Crippen.

988
01:01:23.645 --> 01:01:24.479
Derek Bentley.

989
01:01:24.563 --> 01:01:25.731
Ruth Ellis.

990
01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.775
Well, they were all hung. 
I mean, hanged.

991
01:01:28.859 --> 01:01:31.945
Well, they didn't have
Mr. Hutchinson defending them.


992
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:33.405
Who's prosecuting?

993
01:01:33.488 --> 01:01:34.823
Neddie Cussen.

994
01:01:35.866 --> 01:01:36.825
Score's 7-to-2.

995
01:01:36.908 --> 01:01:37.993
To you?

996
01:01:38.076 --> 01:01:39.036
To him.

997
01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:40.996
Yes, born prosecutor, Neddie.

998
01:01:41.705 --> 01:01:44.124
Defendant's always guilty
until proven innocent.


999
01:01:44.207 --> 01:01:45.625
Can you get me off?

1000
01:01:47.502 --> 01:01:52.382
Mr. Bunton, you returned the Goya by hand,
and confessed to the theft.


1001
01:01:52.466 --> 01:01:55.469
You gave the police a detailed explanation
of how you stole it,


1002
01:01:55.552 --> 01:01:57.554
and you've explained your motive.

1003
01:01:58.555 --> 01:01:59.556
Can I get you off?

1004
01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:04.186
Almost certainly not.

1005
01:02:06.271 --> 01:02:08.065
Meanwhile, Kempton Bunton,

1006
01:02:08.148 --> 01:02:12.277
the Newcastle man accused of stealing
Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington,


1007
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.448
arrived at the Old Bailey this morning
for the first day of his trial.


1008
01:02:16.531 --> 01:02:18.033
And it was quite an entrance.

1009
01:02:18.116 --> 01:02:21.578
- Did you steal the Goya, Mr. Bunton?
- No, I borrowed it.


1010
01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:22.746
Why?

1011
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:24.206
For the greater good.

1012
01:02:24.915 --> 01:02:26.374
We can still get there.

1013
01:02:28.794 --> 01:02:30.921
He's made his bed. 
He can lie in it.

1014
01:02:35.217 --> 01:02:39.387
The rest of the day was taken up
with empanelling the 12 citizens,


1015
01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:42.641
12 good men and women
who will tomorrow begin to hear


1016
01:02:42.724 --> 01:02:46.770
what promises to be one of
the most eagerly awaited criminal trials


1017
01:02:46.853 --> 01:02:48.021
since the war.

1018
01:02:48.105 --> 01:02:50.690
Another triumph
for The Duke of Wellington.


1019
01:02:50.774 --> 01:02:54.361
And as queues begin to gather
for access to the public gallery,


1020
01:02:54.444 --> 01:02:57.906
there is no doubt that even
by the Old Bailey's standards,


1021
01:02:57.989 --> 01:03:01.076
this one looks
like being a very hot ticket.


1022
01:03:07.666 --> 01:03:09.626
- Are you Kempton Bunton?
- Aye.


1023
01:03:09.751 --> 01:03:14.256
But not named after Kempton Racetrack,
as some would have it.


1024
01:03:14.881 --> 01:03:17.551
Even though it is probable
that I was conceived there.


1025
01:03:17.634 --> 01:03:19.177
It's a yes-or-no answer.

1026
01:03:19.928 --> 01:03:21.346
Yes, my lord.

1027
01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:23.473
Me mother named me after Kempton Cannon,

1028
01:03:23.557 --> 01:03:26.935
the jockey who rode St. Amant,
the winner of that year's Derby.


1029
01:03:27.519 --> 01:03:28.979
Do you want me to explain Bunton?

1030
01:03:29.062 --> 01:03:31.356
I didn't want you to explain Kempton.

1031
01:03:32.816 --> 01:03:34.234
Charges.

1032
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:40.115
Kempton Bunton, you are charged
that on the 21st of March, 1961,


1033
01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.118
you stole a picture frame
to the value of £80,


1034
01:03:43.243 --> 01:03:45.162
property of the National Gallery.

1035
01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:47.664
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

1036
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:48.748
Not guilty.

1037
01:03:48.832 --> 01:03:52.085
In the second count,
you are charged that on the same day


1038
01:03:52.169 --> 01:03:56.715
you stole from the National Gallery
the portrait of the Duke of Wellington


1039
01:03:56.798 --> 01:03:59.467
by the artist Francisco Goya

1040
01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:02.095
to the value of £140,000.

1041
01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:05.056
How do you plead? 
Guilty or not guilty?

1042
01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.099
Not guilty.

1043
01:04:06.183 --> 01:04:07.184
Yes!

1044
01:04:08.602 --> 01:04:10.812
For those unfamiliar
with court proceedings,


1045
01:04:10.937 --> 01:04:13.148
that was the plea, not the verdict.

1046
01:04:14.733 --> 01:04:18.862
Kempton Bunton, you are further charged
that following the theft of the portrait,


1047
01:04:18.945 --> 01:04:22.073
you made demands
with menaces for its return.


1048
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.202
- Do you plead guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty.


1049
01:04:25.368 --> 01:04:27.287
And that you created a public nuisance

1050
01:04:27.412 --> 01:04:31.583
by depriving members of the public
of the opportunity to view the portrait.


1051
01:04:31.666 --> 01:04:33.793
Do you plead guilty or not guilty?

1052
01:04:33.877 --> 01:04:35.587
Same again, love. Not guilty.

1053
01:04:37.297 --> 01:04:38.298
Mr. Cussen.

1054
01:04:39.925 --> 01:04:41.051
Thank you, my lord.

1055
01:04:41.134 --> 01:04:45.597
And at 5 a.m.,
when you returned from your rest break,


1056
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.557
what did you see?

1057
01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:50.018
The painting was gone, sir.
Clearly stolen.


1058
01:04:50.894 --> 01:04:51.895
Thank you.

1059
01:04:52.312 --> 01:04:54.564
Mr. Edbury, if you could remain there,

1060
01:04:54.689 --> 01:04:56.900
my learned friend
will have some questions for you.


1061
01:04:59.861 --> 01:05:01.071
Mr. Hutchinson.

1062
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.532
No questions, my lord.

1063
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:10.330
"The conception, design,
and execution of this act was solely,


1064
01:05:10.413 --> 01:05:12.332
singularly and entirely my own."

1065
01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:14.668
And that statement is signed?

1066
01:05:15.126 --> 01:05:16.628
Kempton Bunton.

1067
01:05:17.462 --> 01:05:19.297
Thank you, detective inspector.

1068
01:05:19.381 --> 01:05:22.801
If you would stay there, Mr. Hutchinson
will have some questions for you.


1069
01:05:25.262 --> 01:05:26.596
Mr. Hutchinson.

1070
01:05:27.514 --> 01:05:30.225
The defense has
no questions for this witness.


1071
01:05:32.018 --> 01:05:34.145
At this rate, we'll be finished by tea.

1072
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:38.566
Dr. Unsworth, what is
your professional opinion of the hand?


1073
01:05:39.234 --> 01:05:42.821
The childlike scrawl
across all the ransom notes is,


1074
01:05:42.904 --> 01:05:44.906
when compared to his normal script,

1075
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:48.159
unequivocally the feebly disguised hand
of the accused, Mr. Bunton.


1076
01:05:48.785 --> 01:05:50.328
I'm grateful, Dr. Unsworth.

1077
01:05:50.412 --> 01:05:52.539
If you would remain on stand.

1078
01:05:53.331 --> 01:05:55.500
Any cross examination, Mr. Hutchinson,

1079
01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:57.544
or are you trying to give it up?

1080
01:05:59.045 --> 01:06:00.964
The defense has
no questions for this witness.


1081
01:06:09.472 --> 01:06:10.390
What are you doing?

1082
01:06:10.473 --> 01:06:12.309
The dirt in this house.

1083
01:06:12.434 --> 01:06:14.936
- Stop it.
- Someone's gotta keep this place clean.


1084
01:06:15.061 --> 01:06:18.106
Lord knows
your father will drag us into the gutter.


1085
01:06:19.399 --> 01:06:20.400
That's not true.

1086
01:06:20.859 --> 01:06:22.777
And it's not Dad's fault Marian died.

1087
01:06:22.861 --> 01:06:25.613
He bought her that bike.
Far as he's concerned, he killed her.


1088
01:06:25.697 --> 01:06:26.823
You think I don't know that?

1089
01:06:26.906 --> 01:06:29.326
Well, tell him, then. 
Talk about it.

1090
01:06:29.451 --> 01:06:32.162
Why do you think he does his plays,
and his leaflets, and petitions?


1091
01:06:32.287 --> 01:06:33.788
Defend him all you like.

1092
01:06:33.872 --> 01:06:36.166
I stole the painting. 
Do you hear me?

1093
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.168
I stole the Goya.

1094
01:06:39.878 --> 01:06:40.879
What?

1095
01:06:42.339 --> 01:06:45.717
No, no, you didn't take that painting.
No, you did not.


1096
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.678
Aye, it was me, not Dad.

1097
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:54.517
Please, no, just please tell me
you're talking nonsense, Jackie Bunton.


1098
01:06:56.061 --> 01:06:57.979
- Oh, my God, I'm shaking.
- Mam.


1099
01:06:58.063 --> 01:06:59.439
- I'm shaking.
- I was just...


1100
01:06:59.522 --> 01:07:00.899
Look at me. I'm shaking.

1101
01:07:00.982 --> 01:07:02.734
Stop it.
You're just making yourself shake.


1102
01:07:02.859 --> 01:07:03.818
Sit down.

1103
01:07:05.362 --> 01:07:06.363
Well...

1104
01:07:07.697 --> 01:07:10.867
Well, when did you go to London?

1105
01:07:14.245 --> 01:07:15.705
It was that week I took off work.

1106
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:19.209
But you said you went to Leeds.

1107
01:07:20.627 --> 01:07:22.295
You lied.

1108
01:07:22.379 --> 01:07:24.881
I was sick of
you skivvying for Lady Muck.

1109
01:07:24.964 --> 01:07:26.800
Sick of them all laughing at Dad.

1110
01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.553
I thought the painting might be like...
Well, it might change everything.


1111
01:07:30.637 --> 01:07:33.098
So you're a liar and a thief.

1112
01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:35.642
I just thought if he had
something them bloody toffs wanted,


1113
01:07:35.725 --> 01:07:38.686
they'd have to listen to,
you know, his TV crusade.


1114
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:41.314
Crusade? Jesus Christ, is he now?

1115
01:07:46.277 --> 01:07:47.362
But how?

1116
01:07:48.154 --> 01:07:50.198
I mean, how did you take it?

1117
01:07:52.325 --> 01:07:53.326
I cased the gallery.

1118
01:07:54.786 --> 01:07:59.082
The Goya was just sat there on an easel,
not even a guard standing by it.


1119
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.461
All I had to do was
find somewhere I could break in.


1120
01:08:04.963 --> 01:08:06.256
I went to the toilet.

1121
01:08:07.173 --> 01:08:09.884
And I opened
the toilet window and leaned out.


1122
01:08:10.802 --> 01:08:14.973
There was a courtyard below
with all builders' stuff and ladders.


1123
01:08:16.266 --> 01:08:17.225
Excuse me, mate.

1124
01:08:17.308 --> 01:08:19.644
I went to the security fella
and asked how you get a job.


1125
01:08:19.727 --> 01:08:21.312
You could try the office.

1126
01:08:21.396 --> 01:08:23.773
Cleaners' work, early mornings, 4:30.

1127
01:08:24.858 --> 01:08:27.235
Get night rates, though. 
Lucky buggers.

1128
01:08:28.027 --> 01:08:29.112
I was born lucky.

1129
01:08:30.363 --> 01:08:34.117
And then I figured, well,
if the cleaners were in at half 4,


1130
01:08:34.242 --> 01:08:35.827
they'd have to turn the alarms off.

1131
01:08:36.703 --> 01:08:37.954
So I went back early morning.

1132
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.708
Put a ladder up
just below the toilet window,


1133
01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:43.710
climbed up, and...

1134
01:08:44.627 --> 01:08:47.714
I could hear one
of them automatic floor polishers.


1135
01:08:49.132 --> 01:08:51.426
I waited until he'd passed and then...

1136
01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:55.388
I just walked across the floor.

1137
01:08:55.472 --> 01:08:57.515
Don't suppose
you've ever been to Newcastle?


1138
01:09:04.022 --> 01:09:05.773
What did your father say
when you told him?


1139
01:09:07.317 --> 01:09:09.319
- Fucking hell.
- What do you think?


1140
01:09:09.402 --> 01:09:10.361
I think...

1141
01:09:10.445 --> 01:09:11.779
Fucking hell.

1142
01:09:11.863 --> 01:09:12.947
Hundred and forty grand.

1143
01:09:13.114 --> 01:09:15.492
If you can sell it, which you can't.

1144
01:09:15.575 --> 01:09:17.368
I know. I'm not daft.

1145
01:09:17.452 --> 01:09:20.288
But for pictures, insurance
will pay out 10 percent for safe returns.


1146
01:09:20.413 --> 01:09:22.916
- Have you got a screw loose?
- Are you angry with us?


1147
01:09:22.999 --> 01:09:25.960
Angry? No, I'm furious, you stupid penis.

1148
01:09:26.044 --> 01:09:28.671
You've nicked
the best-known painting on the planet.


1149
01:09:28.755 --> 01:09:29.589
Fucking hell.

1150
01:09:29.672 --> 01:09:32.634
Why can't we use it
to get them free telly licenses?


1151
01:09:32.717 --> 01:09:33.843
Blackmail the bastards.

1152
01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:37.180
Hold the bugger to ransom
to better the lot of the common man?


1153
01:09:37.972 --> 01:09:39.057
One problem.

1154
01:09:40.725 --> 01:09:43.311
- What's that?
- Two words:


1155
01:09:43.394 --> 01:09:45.438
Mrs. Dorothy Bunton.

1156
01:09:48.024 --> 01:09:48.983
We'll hide it from her.

1157
01:09:49.067 --> 01:09:52.111
You can't hide anything
from a woman in her own house.


1158
01:09:52.195 --> 01:09:54.697
No, if she finds it, I stole it.

1159
01:09:54.864 --> 01:09:57.575
- I'm not having you take the blame.
- I stole it.


1160
01:10:00.912 --> 01:10:02.580
On the telly, it was in a frame.

1161
01:10:03.414 --> 01:10:05.833
Shit. I took it off.

1162
01:10:06.459 --> 01:10:09.087
I must've left it
under the bed in me digs. Sorry.


1163
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:11.923
You'd lose your balls
if they weren't in a bag.


1164
01:10:14.717 --> 01:10:16.761
It's not very good, is it?

1165
01:10:51.671 --> 01:10:56.968
"I do solemnly, sincerely,
and truly declare and affirm


1166
01:10:57.051 --> 01:11:01.180
that the evidence
I shall give shall be the truth,


1167
01:11:01.306 --> 01:11:04.851
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."


1168
01:11:04.976 --> 01:11:06.603
Excuse me. Thank you.

1169
01:11:12.775 --> 01:11:14.902
How old are you, Mr. Bunton?

1170
01:11:14.986 --> 01:11:17.614
I don't know. I feel about 23.

1171
01:11:18.573 --> 01:11:19.949
You don't know your date of birth?

1172
01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:22.160
I never had a birth certificate.

1173
01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:23.745
1900, I think.

1174
01:11:23.828 --> 01:11:25.705
Do you know where you were born?

1175
01:11:26.164 --> 01:11:27.165
The back bedroom.

1176
01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:32.003
- Of your mother's house in Newcastle?
- Byker.


1177
01:11:32.086 --> 01:11:35.298
If Newcastle was a dog,
you lifted its tail,


1178
01:11:35.381 --> 01:11:37.508
that hole there, that's Byker.

1179
01:11:39.594 --> 01:11:43.931
Your father fought
in the First World War at Ypres.


1180
01:11:44.015 --> 01:11:45.850
Wipers. He weren't an officer.

1181
01:11:46.517 --> 01:11:48.269
He came back in a wheelchair?

1182
01:11:48.353 --> 01:11:50.980
Aye, tank ran over his legs.

1183
01:11:51.064 --> 01:11:53.399
How did he feel about
the Germans after that?


1184
01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:56.402
Never a bad word.
The Germans didn't have tanks.


1185
01:11:57.236 --> 01:11:58.946
You helped him to run his business.

1186
01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:01.741
Aye, he was a street bookie,
and I did his running for him.


1187
01:12:01.824 --> 01:12:05.578
It was illegal, but you could bribe
the beat bobby with 12 shillings.


1188
01:12:05.662 --> 01:12:06.829
I was as guilty as anybody...

1189
01:12:06.913 --> 01:12:09.374
Who hasn't been guilty
of a youthful indiscretion,


1190
01:12:09.457 --> 01:12:10.792
ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

1191
01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:14.128
The past, as they say, is another country.

1192
01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:15.922
Your father died,

1193
01:12:16.005 --> 01:12:18.925
and you lived with your mother,
who ran pubs.


1194
01:12:19.008 --> 01:12:22.595
Aye, it were a rough game, but
she had a left hook like Henry Cooper's.


1195
01:12:22.679 --> 01:12:24.931
Luckily she didn't cut quite as easy.

1196
01:12:25.556 --> 01:12:27.016
In the Second World War,

1197
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.102
you were refused service
on medical grounds.


1198
01:12:29.185 --> 01:12:31.562
I done me bit. 
I drove lorries.

1199
01:12:31.646 --> 01:12:33.815
- You married young?
- I had to marry.


1200
01:12:33.898 --> 01:12:34.982
Had to marry?

1201
01:12:36.567 --> 01:12:37.568
It was love.

1202
01:12:38.027 --> 01:12:39.362
The decision was made for me.

1203
01:12:41.656 --> 01:12:43.658
Did you intend to steal this painting

1204
01:12:43.783 --> 01:12:47.995
in the sense of permanently
depriving the gallery of it?


1205
01:12:48.079 --> 01:12:49.080
Never.

1206
01:12:49.455 --> 01:12:52.625
Did you ever demand money
with menaces at any time from anyone?


1207
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:53.501
No, sir.

1208
01:12:53.584 --> 01:12:57.463
In 1960, did you communicate
with the Post Office


1209
01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:59.549
about your television license?

1210
01:12:59.632 --> 01:13:01.634
Aye, I told them
I had no intention of paying it,


1211
01:13:01.718 --> 01:13:03.344
because I couldn't receive BBC.

1212
01:13:03.428 --> 01:13:06.097
- You went to prison for not paying it.
- I did.


1213
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:09.934
On your release, you continued
a campaign for free television


1214
01:13:10.017 --> 01:13:12.603
for pensioners and war veterans, correct?

1215
01:13:12.687 --> 01:13:16.023
I could afford a license myself.
It was about the principle of the thing.


1216
01:13:16.107 --> 01:13:19.193
All me life I've looked out for
other people and got into trouble for it.


1217
01:13:19.318 --> 01:13:22.071
When did that begin,
looking out for others?


1218
01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.283
I were about 14.

1219
01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:28.077
Summer holidays.

1220
01:13:28.161 --> 01:13:31.998
I'd just finished reading
Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness,


1221
01:13:32.081 --> 01:13:34.542
and I felt a need to explore Sunderland.

1222
01:13:36.335 --> 01:13:40.131
But I got distracted and found myself
on South Shields Beach.


1223
01:13:40.923 --> 01:13:43.593
I chucked myself in
the sea to cool down.

1224
01:13:43.676 --> 01:13:45.928
A rip tide dragged me out.

1225
01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:49.390
I was on me own,
exhausted, about a mile out,


1226
01:13:49.474 --> 01:13:51.684
and I knew
there was no way I'd get back in.


1227
01:13:52.185 --> 01:13:53.352
But I had faith.

1228
01:13:53.978 --> 01:13:56.272
Not in God, but in people.

1229
01:13:57.774 --> 01:14:00.234
I knew some nosy bugger
would see clothes on the beach,


1230
01:14:00.318 --> 01:14:02.069
and put two and two together.

1231
01:14:03.237 --> 01:14:06.199
So I trusted in that, and waited.

1232
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:12.663
Conserved me energy by floating,
not swimming.


1233
01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.500
Looked at the sky,

1234
01:14:16.292 --> 01:14:17.460
smile on me face.

1235
01:14:18.377 --> 01:14:19.962
You could call it trust.

1236
01:14:21.172 --> 01:14:25.760
An hour later, the lifeboat
pulled up alongside and hauled me in.


1237
01:14:25.885 --> 01:14:28.513
The skipper was a milkman from Blyth,

1238
01:14:29.055 --> 01:14:31.140
by all accounts a bit of a bastard.

1239
01:14:32.016 --> 01:14:33.518
Excuse my French.

1240
01:14:33.601 --> 01:14:36.395
As a milkman, I mean,
but there's good and bad in all of us.


1241
01:14:37.438 --> 01:14:38.564
He saved my life that day.

1242
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:40.983
Could have been anyone,
but I knew someone would.


1243
01:14:41.692 --> 01:14:44.070
I'm not me without you. 
Do you get me?

1244
01:14:44.153 --> 01:14:46.781
- We all need each other?
- No, you are me.


1245
01:14:47.406 --> 01:14:51.369
It's you that makes me, me,
and it's me that makes you, you.


1246
01:14:51.452 --> 01:14:53.496
Humanity is a collective project.

1247
01:14:53.579 --> 01:14:56.916
Look, on me own, 
I'm a single brick.

1248
01:14:56.999 --> 01:14:58.000
A bit useless.

1249
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:00.169
What good's a brick on its tod?

1250
01:15:00.795 --> 01:15:03.256
But you put a load of bricks together,
you get a building.


1251
01:15:03.339 --> 01:15:05.883
You build a building, you create a shadow.

1252
01:15:05.967 --> 01:15:08.010
Already you've changed the world.

1253
01:15:08.135 --> 01:15:10.721
Your philosophy,
I think it earns the appellation.


1254
01:15:10.805 --> 01:15:14.392
How did you apply this thinking
to your own struggle?


1255
01:15:16.018 --> 01:15:19.480
You can't help the dead,
but you can be inspired by them.


1256
01:15:19.564 --> 01:15:23.985
Some of them kids that this country sent
to France and Belgium in 1914 came back.


1257
01:15:24.068 --> 01:15:28.114
They're over 65 now, pensioners,
with not two pennies to rub together.


1258
01:15:28.239 --> 01:15:32.743
And isolation, or not being connected,
to use the modern lingo,


1259
01:15:32.827 --> 01:15:33.995
is no kind of life.

1260
01:15:34.078 --> 01:15:38.082
So what you grandly call my philosophy,
the "I'm you and you're me" thing,


1261
01:15:38.165 --> 01:15:42.587
tells me that every time
someone gets cut off from the rest of us,


1262
01:15:42.712 --> 01:15:46.424
this nation, this country,
becomes a foot shorter.


1263
01:16:01.355 --> 01:16:02.690
Mr. Bunton,

1264
01:16:02.773 --> 01:16:05.234
I suspect the jury are asking themselves

1265
01:16:05.318 --> 01:16:08.613
how any of this applies
to the theft of the Goya.


1266
01:16:08.696 --> 01:16:11.032
- Well, I saw on the news...
- The ITV news?


1267
01:16:12.199 --> 01:16:13.451
Very good.

1268
01:16:13.534 --> 01:16:18.414
I seen that the government was
paying out £140,000 for this painting.


1269
01:16:18.539 --> 01:16:19.999
That, for me, became about numbers.

1270
01:16:20.082 --> 01:16:24.253
If you put that money into a bank account
earning 10 percent interest,


1271
01:16:24.378 --> 01:16:28.758
you could pay
for 3500 TV licenses a year,


1272
01:16:28.841 --> 01:16:30.927
and reconnect with all them people.

1273
01:16:39.685 --> 01:16:41.479
No further questions, my lord.

1274
01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:05.169
You saw the painting on the ITV news,
and realizing it was worth £140,000,


1275
01:17:05.294 --> 01:17:10.091
you decide to come down to London
to steal it for personal gain, didn't you?


1276
01:17:10.257 --> 01:17:12.551
I thought I'd kidnap
it for a while, aye.

1277
01:17:14.136 --> 01:17:17.723
Where did you stay
whilst you planned the heist?


1278
01:17:17.807 --> 01:17:19.767
I took digs near a bucket shop.

1279
01:17:20.559 --> 01:17:21.602
What's a bucket shop?

1280
01:17:22.103 --> 01:17:23.771
A shop that sells buckets.

1281
01:17:25.314 --> 01:17:26.732
Was that deliberate?

1282
01:17:26.816 --> 01:17:28.609
No, but it came in useful.

1283
01:17:28.693 --> 01:17:29.568
In what way?

1284
01:17:29.652 --> 01:17:32.154
Well, this isn't my city, is it?
I don't know my way around.


1285
01:17:32.279 --> 01:17:35.157
So I'd get to Camden and ask a local,
"Where can I buy a bucket?"


1286
01:17:35.282 --> 01:17:37.076
And that way you would get directions?

1287
01:17:37.159 --> 01:17:39.328
Everyone knows where you can buy a bucket.

1288
01:17:40.621 --> 01:17:42.790
Do you know the address of the shop?

1289
01:17:43.749 --> 01:17:45.334
Why? Do you need a bucket?

1290
01:17:47.628 --> 01:17:49.547
We... No, we need... We...

1291
01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:50.464
Excuse me.

1292
01:17:50.548 --> 01:17:52.883
We need the address because
you said you removed the frame


1293
01:17:52.967 --> 01:17:55.511
and hid it under
the bed in your lodgings.

1294
01:17:55.594 --> 01:17:57.388
Is the bucket shop still there?

1295
01:17:57.471 --> 01:18:00.433
I've no idea. I've not been back.
I'm not short of buckets myself.


1296
01:18:01.308 --> 01:18:03.811
Mr. Bunton, you are on trial.

1297
01:18:03.894 --> 01:18:06.647
- This is not an audition for a music hall.
- Sorry, my lord.


1298
01:18:14.113 --> 01:18:16.615
What am I looking at? Ten years?

1299
01:18:18.242 --> 01:18:22.246
I'll make my closing speech,
then the judge will give his summing-up,


1300
01:18:22.329 --> 01:18:27.126
which, I warn you, may sound a bit like
the second speech for the prosecution.


1301
01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:31.338
All the benches up there
have this Latin phrase on them:


1302
01:18:31.422 --> 01:18:33.340
Domine, dirige nos.

1303
01:18:33.924 --> 01:18:35.134
"Lord, direct us."

1304
01:18:35.676 --> 01:18:37.219
God help us, more like.

1305
01:18:40.389 --> 01:18:42.391
Well, I'll give you two some time.

1306
01:18:42.475 --> 01:18:43.476
Please.

1307
01:18:54.195 --> 01:18:56.781
- Well, you're all over the papers.
-Am I?


1308
01:18:59.658 --> 01:19:00.993
You could have told me.

1309
01:19:01.702 --> 01:19:03.537
We could have dealt with it together.

1310
01:19:04.914 --> 01:19:05.915
Could we?

1311
01:19:12.088 --> 01:19:15.549
I read the rest of your play.
I'm sorry you felt you were to blame.


1312
01:19:15.633 --> 01:19:16.675
You're not.

1313
01:19:23.182 --> 01:19:24.308
I went to see her.

1314
01:19:27.019 --> 01:19:28.562
Nice spot, isn't it?

1315
01:19:28.646 --> 01:19:29.688
Lovely.

1316
01:19:32.983 --> 01:19:34.401
Cleaned it up a bit.

1317
01:19:34.527 --> 01:19:35.778
I like the wildness.

1318
01:19:37.029 --> 01:19:38.239
She died in the country.

1319
01:19:38.322 --> 01:19:39.990
Any excuse to do nothing.

1320
01:19:46.497 --> 01:19:47.748
How long will you get?

1321
01:19:48.457 --> 01:19:49.458
I don't know.

1322
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:51.210
Ten years.

1323
01:19:56.549 --> 01:19:58.259
You didn't take the painting.

1324
01:19:59.635 --> 01:20:01.470
Would you rather Jackie was in the dock?

1325
01:20:05.224 --> 01:20:06.225
I'm sorry, Dolly.

1326
01:20:09.395 --> 01:20:10.396
It's a mess.

1327
01:20:15.526 --> 01:20:16.902
It's a mess, all right.

1328
01:20:27.371 --> 01:20:30.875
As night follows day,
Kempton Bunton stole the Goya.


1329
01:20:32.918 --> 01:20:34.503
So say the prosecution.

1330
01:20:35.129 --> 01:20:36.130
Now...

1331
01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.091
that puzzled me,

1332
01:20:40.426 --> 01:20:44.180
because nothing is a crime in this country

1333
01:20:44.305 --> 01:20:49.059
unless it is expressly forbidden by law.

1334
01:20:49.894 --> 01:20:53.772
If your neighbor borrows your lawn mower
and doesn't return it for months,


1335
01:20:53.856 --> 01:20:57.401
it is frustrating, it is annoying,

1336
01:20:57.484 --> 01:20:59.570
but it is not theft.

1337
01:21:01.197 --> 01:21:05.868
Because he had no intention
of permanently depriving you of it.


1338
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:10.414
Kempton Bunton is your neighbor.

1339
01:21:10.539 --> 01:21:13.125
He is not a thief.

1340
01:21:13.209 --> 01:21:15.127
He borrowed your Goya to...

1341
01:21:16.795 --> 01:21:20.216
try and do a bit
of good in this world,

1342
01:21:20.758 --> 01:21:21.967
in a world where...

1343
01:21:24.303 --> 01:21:25.304
I am you,

1344
01:21:27.306 --> 01:21:28.307
and you are me,

1345
01:21:29.391 --> 01:21:33.938
to try and benefit some
of the most vulnerable people in society.


1346
01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:38.359
He returned it,
delivered it in person, the Goya.


1347
01:21:38.442 --> 01:21:40.694
Late, yes.

1348
01:21:41.237 --> 01:21:42.279
Yes.

1349
01:21:43.989 --> 01:21:44.990
Yes.

1350
01:21:48.786 --> 01:21:51.997
Who amongst us
hasn't been late returning a lawn mower?


1351
01:21:55.918 --> 01:21:57.711
When all is said and done...

1352
01:22:02.466 --> 01:22:04.551
he's a pretty good neighbor, really.

1353
01:22:05.970 --> 01:22:06.971
Isn't he?

1354
01:22:10.182 --> 01:22:11.183
Thank you.

1355
01:22:21.694 --> 01:22:27.032
And in response to Mr. Bunton's
confession that he took the Goya,


1356
01:22:27.116 --> 01:22:29.827
you may consider
that as a result of his defense,


1357
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:32.496
every gallery in the country
will be powerless to prevent anyone


1358
01:22:32.579 --> 01:22:36.667
from borrowing a Rubens for the weekend,
to hang in the hallway,


1359
01:22:36.792 --> 01:22:38.919
to impress the chair of the Rotary Club.

1360
01:22:39.003 --> 01:22:41.588
Can this country
really allow such behavior


1361
01:22:41.672 --> 01:22:44.633
to be placed outside our criminal law?

1362
01:22:44.717 --> 01:22:48.053
Now, that is a question
I urge you to focus on now,


1363
01:22:48.804 --> 01:22:51.640
as you retire to consider your verdicts.

1364
01:23:06.739 --> 01:23:08.115
This is a good sandwich.

1365
01:23:09.742 --> 01:23:10.743
It is.

1366
01:23:11.535 --> 01:23:12.536
For cheese.

1367
01:23:44.902 --> 01:23:46.612
Will the foreman please stand?

1368
01:23:47.529 --> 01:23:48.614
And the defendant.

1369
01:23:49.907 --> 01:23:51.492
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1370
01:23:51.575 --> 01:23:55.162
have you reached verdicts
upon which all 12 of you are agreed?


1371
01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.164
We have.

1372
01:23:57.831 --> 01:24:01.835
On the charge of the theft
of a picture frame to the value of £80,


1373
01:24:01.919 --> 01:24:03.879
property of the National Gallery,

1374
01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:06.548
do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?


1375
01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:07.591
Guilty.

1376
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:12.805
Establishment fix-up!

1377
01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:15.891
- Establishment fix-up!
- There will be silence.


1378
01:24:17.101 --> 01:24:19.812
Or I shall order
the public gallery cleared.


1379
01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:24.733
On the charge
of the theft of the Goya portrait


1380
01:24:24.817 --> 01:24:25.984
of the Duke of Wellington,

1381
01:24:26.068 --> 01:24:29.279
do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?


1382
01:24:40.582 --> 01:24:41.542
Not guilty.

1383
01:24:56.223 --> 01:24:59.143
On the charge
of demanding money with menaces


1384
01:24:59.226 --> 01:25:00.561
for the return of the portrait,

1385
01:25:00.644 --> 01:25:03.439
do you find the defendant
guilty or not guilty?


1386
01:25:03.522 --> 01:25:04.773
Not guilty.

1387
01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:08.444
Silence.

1388
01:25:09.361 --> 01:25:10.821
Silence in court.

1389
01:25:12.698 --> 01:25:15.284
On the charge
of creating a public nuisance


1390
01:25:15.367 --> 01:25:18.704
by depriving members of the public
of the opportunity to view the portrait,


1391
01:25:18.787 --> 01:25:21.373
- do you find the defendant guilty...?
- Not guilty.


1392
01:25:27.796 --> 01:25:29.548
It's a hat-trick!

1393
01:25:36.346 --> 01:25:37.306
Silence.

1394
01:25:38.348 --> 01:25:39.391
Silence in court.

1395
01:25:41.602 --> 01:25:44.396
I will have silence.

1396
01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:46.607
Silence in court.

1397
01:25:48.317 --> 01:25:49.401
Remove that woman.

1398
01:25:50.569 --> 01:25:52.488
I'm not going anywhere.

1399
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:17.513
Thank you.

1400
01:26:28.273 --> 01:26:29.900
Give us one of those bags.

1401
01:26:31.068 --> 01:26:32.110
You're here.

1402
01:26:32.236 --> 01:26:35.113
Course I'm here.
Where else do you think I'd be?


1403
01:26:35.572 --> 01:26:39.368
I haven't been wasting me time.
I've written a couple of plays.


1404
01:26:40.369 --> 01:26:42.538
Shakespeare must
be shivering in his boots.


1405
01:26:42.996 --> 01:26:44.373
I expect so.

1406
01:26:44.873 --> 01:26:45.874
And Chekhov.

1407
01:26:47.167 --> 01:26:48.168
Who's Chekhov?

1408
01:26:50.003 --> 01:26:52.548
Remember that play
we went to see about the three sisters?


1409
01:27:20.117 --> 01:27:21.159
There she is.

1410
01:27:29.918 --> 01:27:31.545
- Welcome home, Dad.
- Welcome home, Dad.


1411
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:34.047
I'll put the kettle on.

1412
01:27:35.716 --> 01:27:37.092
Is one of those for me?

1413
01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:40.721
Wet your whistle.

1414
01:27:41.346 --> 01:27:42.848
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


1415
01:27:47.352 --> 01:27:49.438
- I needed that.
- I bet you did.


1416
01:27:50.063 --> 01:27:51.398
Best I've ever tasted.

1417
01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:05.078
The Director of Public Prosecutions and I
have considered the evidence in the case,


1418
01:28:06.163 --> 01:28:07.623
and your confession.

1419
01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:13.337
It goes without saying,
it is an offense of the utmost gravity.


1420
01:28:15.547 --> 01:28:19.051
However, in order to prosecute,

1421
01:28:19.134 --> 01:28:21.011
we would be compelled to call...

1422
01:28:22.763 --> 01:28:24.431
the original defendant.

1423
01:28:24.514 --> 01:28:25.932
It puts us in a delicate position,

1424
01:28:27.184 --> 01:28:30.604
given the public spectacle
your father seems to create.


1425
01:28:31.438 --> 01:28:33.607
So it has been decided that...

1426
01:28:35.692 --> 01:28:38.070
prosecuting you
may not be in the public interest.


1427
01:28:38.153 --> 01:28:41.448
What, you mean Kempton
would make you look stupid again?


1428
01:28:42.949 --> 01:28:43.909
Sorry. I didn't mean...

1429
01:28:43.992 --> 01:28:47.621
Of course, if a single word of this
were ever to go beyond these walls,


1430
01:28:47.704 --> 01:28:49.748
we could always change our minds.

1431
01:28:50.957 --> 01:28:51.792
Clear?

1432
01:28:51.833 --> 01:28:52.918
- Clear.
- Clear.


1433
01:29:04.554 --> 01:29:06.014
- Irene?
- 1 will.


1434
01:29:06.098 --> 01:29:07.182
Will you marry me?

1435
01:29:07.307 --> 01:29:09.101
I just said, I will.

1436
01:29:15.649 --> 01:29:17.651
Just like you on this island, Dr. No.

1437
01:29:17.734 --> 01:29:21.613
It depends, Mr. Bond,
on which side of the glass you are.


1438
01:29:23.073 --> 01:29:26.451
A medium dry martini,
lemon peel, shaken not stirred.


1439
01:29:26.535 --> 01:29:27.953
- Vodka?
- Of course.


1440
01:29:38.964 --> 01:29:40.757
It's that bloody picture again.

1441
01:29:40.841 --> 01:29:42.884
He should put that into a wardrobe.

1442
01:29:42.968 --> 01:29:45.470
He'd have to get Jackie
to fix it for him.

1443
01:29:46.263 --> 01:29:49.391
Well, Dr. No,
you haven't done badly, considering.


1444
01:29:49.474 --> 01:29:51.601
A handicap is what
you make of it... ©
