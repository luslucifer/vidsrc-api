1
00:04:26.504 --> 00:04:29.340
Enemy neutralized, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:04:29.392 --> 00:04:31.134
Objective completed.

3
00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:35.555
- Very nice.
- Yes, very nice.


4
00:04:42.227 --> 00:04:44.938
Introducing your host, 
Dr Howard Marner.

5
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.023
President of Nova Robotics

6
00:05:08.878 --> 00:05:10.667
Well, ladies and gentlemen

7
00:05:10.713 --> 00:05:14.507
I want you to meet strategic artificially
intelligent nuclear transport


8
00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.969
Or SAINT, as we call it.

9
00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:28.803
If a question of survival,
then SAINT is the answer


10
00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:31.940
It is quite simply, the most
sophisticated robot on planet Earth.


11
00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:40.032
Adaptable to steaming jungle and burning
deserts and frozen arctic wastes


12
00:05:41.575 --> 00:05:44.075
Well, of course it's adaptable
because it's a robot.


13
00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.737
Therefore, impervious to...

14
00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.041
- the ravages of nature.
- Crush ice.


15
00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:58.257
Glass. Ice.

16
00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.801
Gin.

17
00:06:01.386 --> 00:06:02.387
Tonic.

18
00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:06.681
A squeeze of lime.

19
00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:13.814
- Your cocktail, Dr. Marner.
- Thank you, Number 2.


20
00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:20.236
Just the way I like it...

21
00:06:20.288 --> 00:06:22.322
shaken, but not stirred.

22
00:06:25.783 --> 00:06:27.284
Oh my...

23
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.285
Well...

24
00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:30.604
One thing we can't control
is the weather. The man


25
00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:32.748
upstairs is still in
charge of that department.


26
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.920
So, why don't we just move our
little presentation back into the lab?


27
00:07:03.193 --> 00:07:05.946
- Oh, and one more thing Dr. Marner.
- Yes, Senator Mills.


28
00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:09.074
Where's the young man
that actually designed these things?


29
00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:10.424
- Dr. Crosby?
- Yes.


30
00:07:10.425 --> 00:07:12.293
We were told we
would be meeting with him.

31
00:07:12.296 --> 00:07:13.521
And so you shall.

32
00:07:13.573 --> 00:07:14.695
- When?
- Soon.


33
00:07:14.747 --> 00:07:16.707
Maybe not today, but soon.

34
00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.667
- Why not today?
- Flu.


35
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.129
I'd feel happier about approving this
project if I could speak with him.


36
00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:25.621
I'll see what I can do.

37
00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:28.634
Would you excuse me for just...
I'll be back in just a second.


38
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.512
Norman, bolt up the motion
control system please.


39
00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:33.514
Don't forget that.
It's very important.


40
00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:35.292
Where is he?

41
00:07:35.344 --> 00:07:37.017
I need him.

42
00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:37.799
Stat!

43
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:38.852
Excuse me sir.

44
00:07:39.644 --> 00:07:42.314
Crosby... he is hiding in the toilet, sir.

45
00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:44.472
Public relations is everybody's job.

46
00:07:44.524 --> 00:07:47.798
Well he is sitting at the cross
they are making him dog sick, sir.


47
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.073
Look. He's supposed to be here.
I want him here. I pay him to be here.


48
00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:54.201
Well, the last time I am seeing him,
he is busy vomiting, sir.


49
00:07:54.253 --> 00:07:57.161
Well, clean him up and
send him out to hob nob.


50
00:07:57.213 --> 00:07:58.537
Stat!

51
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:11.592
Newton, come on, hurry up.
They are waiting for you.


52
00:08:15.303 --> 00:08:17.931
Newton Crosby. You must make
instantaneous appearance.


53
00:08:17.983 --> 00:08:19.213
Marner says "Stat".

54
00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:22.394
You have to go
hob nob with the big wigs.


55
00:08:23.812 --> 00:08:26.731
Is that a yes or the number
of your intelligence quotient?


56
00:08:26.783 --> 00:08:28.139
Ben, I don't hob nob.

57
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.819
If you you like all that P.R. crap,
why don't you go hob nob.


58
00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:33.060
Mingle with the brass. Have a ball.

59
00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:36.448
I am sick of wearing
the dress in this family.


60
00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:41.634
Crosby, now don't you hang up on me.
I know you're there.


61
00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:43.247
I want you up here right away!

62
00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.906
Come on Newton! Swallow
your guts. You can do it.


63
00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.794
Show them that you're a hot shot
fun guy underneath your clothes.


64
00:08:48.846 --> 00:08:50.117
Now, what do they need me for?

65
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.190
To tell them each robot costs

66
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:54.966
Ben, a child of
four can tell them that.

67
00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:56.374
That is why they are needing you.

68
00:08:56.426 --> 00:08:58.751
- Now come on. Hurry up!
- Just one dance.


69
00:08:58.803 --> 00:09:00.888
Now, I have to go to the jack.
So you wait for me.


70
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.889
The "john."

71
00:09:03.641 --> 00:09:04.924
Oh, ya, you're doing real good.

72
00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:08.603
- Just keep working on those last two bars.
- Let us go!


73
00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:13.567
Coming through, please.

74
00:09:14.192 --> 00:09:18.530
Wine coolers. Perier, 
Long Island ice tea.

75
00:09:18.582 --> 00:09:19.906
Please take a drink.

76
00:09:20.198 --> 00:09:22.023
...he's putting on a tie.

77
00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:24.369
He's going to tell you about
these peace time uses.


78
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.521
It's got plenty of peace time uses.

79
00:09:26.573 --> 00:09:28.622
You mean besides serving gin and tonic?

80
00:09:29.957 --> 00:09:32.918
The only way to secure the peace,
Senator, and I'm sure you know...


81
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.785
is be prepared. See...

82
00:09:34.837 --> 00:09:38.466
We can parachute these robot guys
behind enemy lines.


83
00:09:38.518 --> 00:09:41.041
They hide out till
the first strike blows over.


84
00:09:41.093 --> 00:09:44.220
Then, each one of these little boogers
carries a 25 megaton bomb


85
00:09:44.262 --> 00:09:48.975
right up the middle main street of Moscow.
Like the mail man bringing bad news.


86
00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:52.677
We call it "Operation Gotcha Last".

87
00:09:52.729 --> 00:09:55.857
- That's what you call insuring peace.
- Oh, ya...


88
00:09:55.909 --> 00:09:56.733
just...

89
00:09:56.775 --> 00:09:58.675
We're all thinking the same way.
Would you


90
00:09:58.676 --> 00:10:00.487
like to see our control
center, Senator?


91
00:10:06.784 --> 00:10:10.204
Hey, Norman. You better get
number 5 off that generator, man.


92
00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:13.332
OK, OK, I'll get to it.

93
00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:23.800
Run, Jim!

94
00:10:33.726 --> 00:10:35.061
Jesus H God!

95
00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:37.146
What the hell happened?

96
00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:39.147
I don't know.

97
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.109
Oh my God! It's fried.

98
00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:48.490
Oh! We're in deep shit now, man.

99
00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:50.982
I hope got a few million bucks.

100
00:10:51.034 --> 00:10:54.162
Because that's what they're going
to charge us if this think is fried.


101
00:10:54.214 --> 00:10:56.497
- Everything checks out.
- What?


102
00:10:57.164 --> 00:11:00.167
It's amazing.
Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.


103
00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:05.548
OK, robots. Verbal command. Access
code 29 report to disarming section.


104
00:11:07.008 --> 00:11:09.260
Get out of here, you little crap bucket!

105
00:11:09.312 --> 00:11:10.386
Go on!

106
00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:37.911
It's the ultimate soldier.

107
00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:40.487
Obeys orders, never asks questions.

108
00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:43.125
Originally, I had non-military
purposes in mind.


109
00:11:43.177 --> 00:11:45.586
I designed it as a marital aid.

110
00:11:48.088 --> 00:11:49.340
Very funny.

111
00:11:50.382 --> 00:11:51.205
No...

112
00:11:51.257 --> 00:11:54.427
I'm sure we'll all agree that
Dr. Crosby has designed a weapon...


113
00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:57.164
that will keep our world safe
for all time.


114
00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.849
Howard, what's so safe
about blowing people up?


115
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.403
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.


116
00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:15.906
Hot coffee.

117
00:12:19.284 --> 00:12:23.455
Coffee service coming through.
Please watch your step.


118
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.370
Please serve yourselves.
Have a canopy. Shrimp toast. Caviar.


119
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.948
Pate, salmon moose, 
Cheese Whiz...

120
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.253
Ladies and gentlemen,
our prototypes are here.


121
00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.891
I've only counted 4,
so tell me I've miscounted.


122
00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:30.508
- Gag me with a fork, sir.
- What?


123
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.229
Number 5 left the debriefing station
and then it just disappeared.


124
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:34.971
Oh, God, not today!

125
00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.358
- Alright, call security.
- I did, sir, stat.


126
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.943
Good, you did, great.
Just stay calm!


127
00:13:54.541 --> 00:13:57.085
- How're you doing?
- Running late as usual.


128
00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:10.264
I knew it. God damned garbage cans!

129
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.674
Garbage cans with guns.
Newfangled bullshit!


130
00:14:13.726 --> 00:14:16.451
- Have you got anything stronger?
- I got trouble which I don't need.


131
00:14:16.452 --> 00:14:18.431
Because my wife is home
cooking a steak which


132
00:14:18.432 --> 00:14:20.280
is going to be dried
out when I get there.


133
00:14:20.283 --> 00:14:23.777
I think we got it.
What is that right there?


134
00:14:25.445 --> 00:14:28.406
- Coffee machine.
- You're right, that's what it is.


135
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.982
- It's a coffee machine.
- That's very good, Howard.


136
00:14:31.034 --> 00:14:34.745
Now it is time to freeze this place,
seal the doors, slam the gates shut.


137
00:14:37.873 --> 00:14:40.209
All right, good enough.

138
00:14:41.043 --> 00:14:43.170
OK, here you go.

139
00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:47.883
Main gate. Captain.

140
00:14:58.309 --> 00:15:00.384
- Where did you disappear to?
- I was hob nobbing.


141
00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:03.565
OK, OK come on over here quick.
Come on. Come on, quick.


142
00:15:03.566 --> 00:15:06.435
The guys downstairs say that number

143
00:15:06.436 --> 00:15:08.611
He should have shut down.
Did you try the return code?


144
00:15:08.612 --> 00:15:09.978
Ya, no response.

145
00:15:32.049 --> 00:15:33.791
This is very strange,
he won't talk to me.

146
00:15:33.843 --> 00:15:37.304
- You sure number 5 is operational?
- Ya, as far as I know.


147
00:15:37.356 --> 00:15:39.390
- Check the list polling system.
- OK.


148
00:15:39.442 --> 00:15:41.006
Let's try the emergency override.

149
00:15:41.058 --> 00:15:42.768
This is bullshit. 
Just let me go get it.

150
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.928
Access code, 42721.

151
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.638
Access gained, number 5 standing by.

152
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.775
With that ease,
you've gotten him on your terminal.


153
00:15:50.827 --> 00:15:51.776
You're just a fine kid.

154
00:15:52.277 --> 00:15:54.237
Report your position.

155
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.741
Malfunction, need input.

156
00:16:09.793 --> 00:16:11.335
What the hell's a need input for?

157
00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:13.556
I don't know,
I guess it can't triangulate his position.


158
00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:14.607
That's a simple function.

159
00:16:14.608 --> 00:16:17.511
Do you know how to triangulate
your position, Howard?


160
00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:19.234
- No.
- Well, then, there you go.


161
00:16:19.286 --> 00:16:21.346
I'm glad you think
this is all such a joke, Crosby.


162
00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.555
Don't worry, Skroeder,
you're not going to miss a meal.


163
00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:25.623
Just shut it down, pick it up.

164
00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:31.721
Unable, malfunction.

165
00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:33.983
How can it refuse to turn itself off?

166
00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:35.182
Maybe it's pissed off.

167
00:16:35.183 --> 00:16:37.392
It's a machine, Skroeder,
it doesn't get pissed off...


168
00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:40.298
it doesn't get happy, it doesn't get sad,
it doesn't laugh at your jokes.


169
00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.132
- It just runs programming.
- Usually runs programs.


170
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.319
Anybody try the homing device yet?

171
00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:49.581
- No.
- Oh, come on you guys, use your heads!


172
00:16:50.082 --> 00:16:52.709
It's probably right down the hall and...

173
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:55.337
Ah... Here it comes...
Here it comes...


174
00:16:55.712 --> 00:16:57.506
And...

175
00:16:58.674 --> 00:17:00.383
Bingo!

176
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.585
Good lord!
It is outside the fence!


177
00:17:04.637 --> 00:17:06.972
Oh, and that is not
the worst of it, Dr. Marner.


178
00:17:07.024 --> 00:17:09.642
Don't tell me its laser is still armed.

179
00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:11.175
Bimbo!

180
00:17:11.227 --> 00:17:12.603
Crosby, what's he going to do?

181
00:17:12.655 --> 00:17:14.136
Howard, it's hard to say.

182
00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:16.096
It's malfunctioning.
It might not do anything.


183
00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:19.734
But it could decide to blow away
anything that moves. Couldn't it?


184
00:17:19.786 --> 00:17:21.987
Couldn't it, Crosby?

185
00:17:41.422 --> 00:17:44.425
Oh, my God. It's not coming back.
We've got to destroy it.


186
00:17:44.477 --> 00:17:46.473
No. Howard, you're
overreacting. You can't...


187
00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:48.470
Look, let us at least
try to catch it first.

188
00:17:48.522 --> 00:17:49.820
Ya, we'll panic later, OK?

189
00:17:49.872 --> 00:17:51.612
What if you don't catch it.
What if it goes


190
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.233
out and melts down a
bus load of nuns...


191
00:17:53.234 --> 00:17:55.359
How would you like to
write the headline on that one?


192
00:17:55.362 --> 00:17:57.270
- Nun soup?
- Ben!


193
00:17:58.604 --> 00:17:59.637
- Howard.
- What?


194
00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:02.567
OK, it's malfunctioning. 
Think about it.

195
00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:04.893
- What about function?
- Alright, look...


196
00:18:04.945 --> 00:18:07.155
Why don't you get your
team together and Skroeder,


197
00:18:07.207 --> 00:18:07.946
Duke, Otis!

198
00:18:07.947 --> 00:18:10.297
- And detain number 5 the best you can...
- Alright, Howard.


199
00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.297
- and still avoid an incident.
- I'm already moving.


200
00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:13.247
And Skroeder,

201
00:18:13.335 --> 00:18:15.237
You understand
you don't have to blow it up.


202
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:17.988
You don't have to blow it up, Skroeder.

203
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.949
Just try and bring it back in one piece.
- One piece will do.


204
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:25.297
Whatever it takes to put that stupid
contraption out of commission, gentlemen,


205
00:18:25.349 --> 00:18:28.425
- that's what you do.
- Yes sir.


206
00:18:37.308 --> 00:18:39.091
Give inertial status...

207
00:18:39.143 --> 00:18:43.397
Let's scramble one, maybe it'll listen
to what comes with a decoder.


208
00:18:43.449 --> 00:18:44.263
What is this?

209
00:18:44.264 --> 00:18:46.230
Running diagnostics.
Testing its logic circuits.


210
00:18:46.233 --> 00:18:49.527
Let's just bounce on off its magnesium
casing. What do you think, I don't know.


211
00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:51.988
What is this? Input, Input, Input...

212
00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:53.229
Come on...

213
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:54.991
Let's boot it up.
See if you can boot it.


214
00:18:55.043 --> 00:18:58.875
Return to D-Station...
Come on. Now!


215
00:18:58.927 --> 00:19:02.707
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

216
00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.584
Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?

217
00:19:05.636 --> 00:19:06.585
What is going on?

218
00:19:06.794 --> 00:19:08.452
I don't know,
must be the print scanner...


219
00:19:08.504 --> 00:19:12.216
- it must be reading it some place.
- I'm not understanding the reference


220
00:19:18.806 --> 00:19:20.641
Need input.

221
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:23.602
Input.

222
00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:55.173
- Did you see something?
- Oh God... I hope not.


223
00:19:55.225 --> 00:19:58.093
- Well, I saw something.
- Ya, me too.


224
00:19:58.145 --> 00:19:59.720
Oh shit!

225
00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:05.704
It's right outside.
- Captain Skroeder, Captain Skroeder


226
00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:08.436
<i>This is Bravo 4, over.
Skroeder, what have you got, over.</i>


227
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.523
He's right in front of us, sir, we're
on the bridge out on 101, over.


228
00:20:12.575 --> 00:20:16.193
We're on our way.
Loose it and you're dead meat.


229
00:20:47.056 --> 00:20:49.600
- It's going berserk.
- Ben, how'd this happen?


230
00:20:49.652 --> 00:20:52.144
Who is knowing how to read
the mind of a robot?


231
00:20:54.937 --> 00:20:57.106
Weeeeee!

232
00:21:27.511 --> 00:21:30.078
I am not cut out for this!
You did this, Crosby...


233
00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:32.355
- Howard!
- so you wouldn't have to talk to those people.


234
00:21:32.358 --> 00:21:33.380
Just calm down.

235
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.235
Excuse me, sir, but we're loosing
its signal. It's going out of range.


236
00:21:36.236 --> 00:21:37.716
We're going to have to follow it now.

237
00:21:37.717 --> 00:21:39.107
Can I get a vehicle? Can I get...

238
00:21:39.108 --> 00:21:42.445
- Howard, is there a van or anything like that?
- Of course there's a van!


239
00:21:52.033 --> 00:21:55.328
Thanks for calling me, Mrs. Cepeda,
where's that son of a bitch?


240
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.623
He's around the bend and up
to no good, you better believe it.


241
00:22:00.625 --> 00:22:03.461
Get the hell down here, Beasley!

242
00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:06.246
- Hey!
- What are you doing home?


243
00:22:06.298 --> 00:22:08.507
This is my home! It's not
your home. I live here.


244
00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:10.159
What are you doing with Beasley?

245
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:11.708
Uh... well, darn it, you know

246
00:22:11.709 --> 00:22:13.484
he looked kind of sick
to me so I thought...

247
00:22:13.485 --> 00:22:15.675
I'd just take him down to the vet
and fix him up a bit.


248
00:22:15.676 --> 00:22:17.402
He doesn't look sick, you look sick.

249
00:22:17.427 --> 00:22:19.049
What did you come back
here for anyway?


250
00:22:19.101 --> 00:22:22.813
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought that
maybe we could patch things up.


251
00:22:22.865 --> 00:22:25.523
Sort of pick up where we left off.

252
00:22:26.607 --> 00:22:28.693
You know you want me back.

253
00:22:28.745 --> 00:22:30.977
What is this?

254
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:33.239
Quinn's Medical Research? 
You slime bag!

255
00:22:33.291 --> 00:22:34.814
The dog is on its last legs.

256
00:22:34.866 --> 00:22:37.055
That's very funny. Why don't
you get the hell out of here!


257
00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:39.245
You know what I figure?
I figure you owe me some money.


258
00:22:39.297 --> 00:22:41.039
- So I'm just here to collect.
- I owe you?


259
00:22:41.091 --> 00:22:42.989
- That's right.
- I supported you.


260
00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:46.668
That was my money you used
to buy your big red dorkmobile!


261
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.128
No! Damn it!

262
00:22:49.671 --> 00:22:50.672
Hey! Hey!

263
00:22:53.216 --> 00:22:56.303
- Do not do that car!
- Get away from me!


264
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.183
Alright. If this is your idea of playing
hard to get, you can knock it off now.


265
00:23:02.235 --> 00:23:03.757
You mutation!

266
00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:06.937
- God damn it! Don't ever call me that!
- You don't even know what it means!


267
00:23:06.989 --> 00:23:08.898
Ya, well, I can find out!

268
00:23:09.857 --> 00:23:12.943
Hey! You! You leave her alone!

269
00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:19.678
- Oh, God!
- Oh honey!


270
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.608
- Are you OK, honey?
- Ya.


271
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.393
- Are you sure?
- Ya, I'm fine.


272
00:23:23.394 --> 00:23:25.179
And I thought he
was going to be a nice one.


273
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.961
- Different from the other ones.
- Ya right!


274
00:23:26.962 --> 00:23:30.716
- Well, he sure was better looking.
- Well, looks aren't everything.


275
00:23:31.628 --> 00:23:34.339
I know that.
Every time I look at Mr. Cepeda.


276
00:23:34.391 --> 00:23:36.998
Honey, listen,
I hate to tell you this but a...


277
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.927
the man from the city...
he was snooping around again.


278
00:23:39.979 --> 00:23:41.627
I told them all this was temporary.

279
00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:43.712
It's just until I
can find homes for them.

280
00:23:43.764 --> 00:23:45.800
Well, he says that four years
is not too temporary.


281
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.458
He was going to
call the sheriff on you.

282
00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:48.423
Oh, great!

283
00:23:48.477 --> 00:23:51.292
Maybe the sheriff would like a pet?

284
00:23:51.344 --> 00:23:54.310
Beasley. Beasley come to me, baby.

285
00:23:54.362 --> 00:23:57.224
Good Beasley!
Beasley, come here.


286
00:23:57.276 --> 00:23:59.570
Did he scare you?
Did he scare you, honey?


287
00:23:59.622 --> 00:24:00.561
I'm sorry.

288
00:24:00.613 --> 00:24:04.033
I feel like I've been cooped up
inside this lab forever.


289
00:24:04.085 --> 00:24:06.744
Well, it's an opportunity
to spread your legs.


290
00:24:06.796 --> 00:24:08.251
Good to smell the breezes, hum?

291
00:24:08.303 --> 00:24:09.654
Has it changed much out there?

292
00:24:09.706 --> 00:24:11.582
Oh, yes, you can say that two times.

293
00:24:11.634 --> 00:24:12.990
Hey! Hey! Come on you guys!

294
00:24:13.042 --> 00:24:15.585
Come on, get points!
Skroeder's coming up empty!


295
00:24:15.637 --> 00:24:18.078
We're on our way, Howard,
to the great outdoors.


296
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.133
Newton, you know what is out there
in the great outdoors?


297
00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:23.041
Girls. Ummm.

298
00:24:23.093 --> 00:24:25.627
With brassieres and legs.

299
00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:27.347
You have the working knowledge the girl?

300
00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:28.797
No, but I read about them.

301
00:24:28.849 --> 00:24:31.268
Well then... maybe I can furnish you
with some schematic drawings.


302
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.466
All right.

303
00:24:32.518 --> 00:24:35.219
Hey! Who told you could
take Number One?


304
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:37.606
Howard, logically, if we need
protection from Number Five...


305
00:24:37.658 --> 00:24:39.014
this is the best weapon
we could have.


306
00:24:39.066 --> 00:24:41.527
Great, great!
So, instead of $11 million on the loose...


307
00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:43.534
we're going to have
twenty-two.


308
00:24:43.586 --> 00:24:45.489
And plus, we are needing
gas money.


309
00:24:49.327 --> 00:24:51.036
I'm sorry.
I just...


310
00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:53.163
I have to draw the line
at snakes.


311
00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:57.500
Ya, I'm sure it would make
a wonderful pet, but...


312
00:24:57.751 --> 00:25:01.796
wait, isn't there a home
for cobras somewhere?


313
00:25:02.339 --> 00:25:04.424
Can you hang on
for a second?


314
00:25:13.015 --> 00:25:15.517
Can I call you right back?
Thanks.


315
00:25:19.813 --> 00:25:21.774
Hey! Get out of there!

316
00:25:25.194 --> 00:25:26.861
Frank?

317
00:25:27.445 --> 00:25:29.530
Mr. Scumo!

318
00:25:33.326 --> 00:25:35.828
I know you're in there.

319
00:25:37.872 --> 00:25:40.833
Get out! Get out!
I'll call the cops.


320
00:25:52.678 --> 00:25:54.554
What?
Are you deaf?


321
00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:04.397
Oh, my God!

322
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.739
Oh, my God! I knew they'd
pick me. I just knew it.


323
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.120
Hello.

324
00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:22.580
Well, I guess...

325
00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:26.668
welcome to my planet.

326
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.299
Oh boy! Is this thrilling or what?

327
00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:37.304
Don't be scared.

328
00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:39.221
I'm a friend.

329
00:26:39.722 --> 00:26:41.640
Friend?

330
00:26:45.394 --> 00:26:47.730
Do you know
the word "friend"?


331
00:26:48.397 --> 00:26:51.400
Because that's what I am.
I'm a friend.


332
00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:53.777
So, here I come.

333
00:26:54.194 --> 00:26:57.739
Nice and extremely friendly.

334
00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:15.631
Hi.
It's me.


335
00:27:18.967 --> 00:27:21.720
So, this is earth.

336
00:27:21.887 --> 00:27:24.598
I'm Stephanie.
Speck.


337
00:27:25.515 --> 00:27:27.267
No offense, but...

338
00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:30.354
is that really you or is that
like a space suit...


339
00:27:30.588 --> 00:27:33.181
and you're inside some place,
maybe just your brain...


340
00:27:33.272 --> 00:27:35.358
in a little jar
or something like that?


341
00:27:35.858 --> 00:27:38.569
- Malfunction.
- You can talk!


342
00:27:38.903 --> 00:27:41.656
Malfunction.
Need input.


343
00:27:42.281 --> 00:27:43.658
Input.

344
00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:45.826
That's information.

345
00:27:46.452 --> 00:27:48.537
Listen, I am full of it.

346
00:27:48.913 --> 00:27:52.415
Why don't you come to my house
and we can sit down and talk...


347
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:55.835
get to know each other.
Communicate. Input.


348
00:27:57.045 --> 00:28:00.090
Come on.
It's okay.


349
00:28:03.134 --> 00:28:07.138
No, no.
I mean come with me.


350
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:13.227
Come here. This way.

351
00:28:23.404 --> 00:28:25.062
Come here.

352
00:28:25.114 --> 00:28:28.178
Come on. Right this way.

353
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.244
March! Heel! Giddy up!

354
00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:33.705
- Forward!
- Forward!


355
00:28:34.414 --> 00:28:36.416
Forward, forward.
Come forward.


356
00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:39.085
That's good.
That's really good.


357
00:28:39.335 --> 00:28:41.546
Don't be afraid, guys.
He's a friend.


358
00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:43.913
These are animals.
They're lower life forms.


359
00:28:43.965 --> 00:28:47.217
They're always a little skittish
around new people, aliens. Whatever.


360
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:49.928
Malfunction. Need input.

361
00:28:50.012 --> 00:28:52.462
Input.
All right, right. You got it, OK.


362
00:28:52.514 --> 00:28:55.726
This is a house.
We live within it, inside it.


363
00:28:56.059 --> 00:28:58.729
- We have a floor, see...
- Floor.


364
00:28:59.229 --> 00:29:01.148
And we have the opposite
of a floor...


365
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.983
which is the ceiling.
Look up!


366
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.807
Ceiling.

367
00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:06.527
We have windows and...

368
00:29:06.986 --> 00:29:09.572
air! Look over here.

369
00:29:11.157 --> 00:29:12.450
Light.

370
00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:15.953
Music.

371
00:29:17.079 --> 00:29:19.665
And... look at this.

372
00:29:19.717 --> 00:29:22.250
This is a plant.
See?


373
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.377
And these are goldfish.

374
00:29:24.919 --> 00:29:26.703
Don't touch.

375
00:29:26.755 --> 00:29:28.944
And look over there.

376
00:29:28.996 --> 00:29:31.082
See, these are ants.

377
00:29:31.134 --> 00:29:33.553
They're not aunts,
they're ants.


378
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.972
It's an ant farm.

379
00:29:36.556 --> 00:29:40.976
Look! These are my bunnies.
Edwina and Norman.


380
00:29:41.477 --> 00:29:43.128
Norman.

381
00:29:43.179 --> 00:29:45.397
I bet you got some amazing
animals in your planet.


382
00:29:46.982 --> 00:29:48.734
Good, there you go.

383
00:29:49.026 --> 00:29:50.819
This is Earth, where
we are now.


384
00:29:51.362 --> 00:29:54.615
You are here.
Here.


385
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.951
- Oregon.
- Oregon.


386
00:29:57.201 --> 00:29:59.035
Home of the beaver,
famous for cherries.


387
00:29:59.327 --> 00:30:01.496
Beavers.
Cherries. Input.


388
00:30:01.913 --> 00:30:03.539
I'm giving you
great input.


389
00:30:03.706 --> 00:30:05.875
More input.
More input.


390
00:30:06.584 --> 00:30:08.795
How about pictures?
Do you like pictures?


391
00:30:09.379 --> 00:30:10.838
We have a lot
of pictures here.


392
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:13.007
A lot of them.

393
00:30:14.008 --> 00:30:17.636
This is a picture
of an aardvark.


394
00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:20.597
See that? It's an aardvark.

395
00:30:20.931 --> 00:30:24.059
- It's a mammal.
- Input. Aardvark.


396
00:30:24.351 --> 00:30:27.813
- Abyssinia, Adams...
- Holy Crowl. You can read.


397
00:30:32.401 --> 00:30:33.944
Input.

398
00:30:34.236 --> 00:30:35.987
- More input.
- Okay, no problem.


399
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:39.156
Volume two.
No problem.


400
00:30:47.123 --> 00:30:50.167
- My neck.
- Sorry.


401
00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:52.076
This is very healthful
for the neck.


402
00:30:52.128 --> 00:30:54.713
Can you believe it's been

403
00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:56.037
I'd say ten.

404
00:30:56.089 --> 00:30:58.122
It's all coming
back to me, though.


405
00:30:58.174 --> 00:31:00.176
You know what many people
are liking at night?


406
00:31:00.427 --> 00:31:02.304
- What?
- Headlights.


407
00:31:04.431 --> 00:31:06.850
- It's a lot better. Thanks.
- Definitely, ya


408
00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:19.653
More input, Stephanie.

409
00:31:19.695 --> 00:31:21.614
- More!
- There isn't anymore.


410
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.741
You've read everything
in the house.


411
00:31:26.035 --> 00:31:28.454
Animal.
Mammal, skunk.


412
00:31:29.912 --> 00:31:32.248
That's a container
drinking glass.


413
00:31:32.707 --> 00:31:35.355
Pasta, semolina,
spaghetti.


414
00:31:35.407 --> 00:31:37.952
Food, liquid,
spaghetti sauce.


415
00:31:38.004 --> 00:31:40.632
Look, this may be hilarious
where you come from...


416
00:31:40.684 --> 00:31:42.550
but on this planet it's considered rude.

417
00:31:43.217 --> 00:31:46.721
Plants, fruits, oranges...

418
00:31:47.012 --> 00:31:49.306
apples, lemons, limes.

419
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.475
That's great.
Thanks a lot.


420
00:31:51.808 --> 00:31:53.268
Fabric.
Tablecloth.


421
00:31:53.894 --> 00:31:56.104
No, my dishes!

422
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.106

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.863
- Numerous fragments.
- Ok, fine...


426
00:32:05.915 --> 00:32:07.531
Some large, some small.

427
00:32:08.282 --> 00:32:10.201
Take a look at this.
Look at that.

00:32:14.747 --> 00:32:16.248
Right.
Input, input.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.625
Good.

432
00:32:18.376 --> 00:32:21.837
Ok, here. You hold this.
That's very good.


433
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:23.755
And stay.
Stay.

Don't we have to find
a robot?


443
00:33:08.715 --> 00:33:13.219
Pardon me for saying so,
but you're becoming a drag strip.


444
00:33:13.261 --> 00:33:16.055
Girls are not my best suits.
Besides, we got a job to do.


445
00:33:16.222 --> 00:33:18.181
As we're fond of saying

- Bakersfield, originally.

- No, I mean your ancestors.
- Oh, them.

Don't get up.
I can take care of this.


463
00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:11.598
Haven't you had enough
of this stuff?


464
00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:16.111
You lose IQ points the longer you
watch. There've been actual studies.


465
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.283
Look, you're going to become
the 1st alien couch potato...


466
00:34:21.335 --> 00:34:24.036
and I'm not kidding.
Give me that. Give me that thing.


467

<i>...by eating Thomases
English Muffin...</i>

- Have a heart!
- "Have a heart"...


469
00:34:37.182 --> 00:34:39.292
"Don't cry, little girl",
"Smile your tears away"...

Call now! Our operators

473

Accountant in a Can.

And if you act now,
we'll send along...


475
00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.147
You didn't come a million miles
to do TV commercials, did you?


476
00:34:55.107 --> 00:34:57.182
<i>- Duracell...
- Of course you didn't.</i>


477
00:34:57.234 --> 00:35:00.946
Come on. There's something
I wanna show you outside.


478
00:35:01.154 --> 00:35:03.532
Bird. Raven.
Never more.


479
00:35:03.991 --> 00:35:06.159
Now look.
Look.


480
00:35:06.826 --> 00:35:11.122
Look.
No, no. There.


481
00:35:11.664 --> 00:35:13.124
See?

482
00:35:14.375 --> 00:35:16.377
Beautiful.

483
00:35:16.877 --> 00:35:19.839
- Light bulb.
- No. Sun.


484
00:35:20.506 --> 00:35:22.633
Beautiful.
No sun.


485
00:35:23.676 --> 00:35:27.554
- Beautiful sun.
- Beautiful.


486
00:35:28.013 --> 00:35:29.973
Rhinoceros, turtle...

487
00:35:30.265 --> 00:35:31.975
Volkswagen.

488
00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:35.145
You mean with that fat little
body, you can see those things.


489
00:35:39.566 --> 00:35:41.026
Beautiful animal.

490
00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:43.652
Mammal, canine, dog.

491
00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.447
Mutt.

492
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.117
- Beasley.
- Beasley.


493
00:35:53.704 --> 00:35:55.289
Beasley, stop it!

494
00:35:55.664 --> 00:35:58.167
Beasley, down!
What are you doing?


495
00:35:58.459 --> 00:35:59.460
Stop it!

496
00:35:59.793 --> 00:36:00.752
Look out!

497
00:36:03.588 --> 00:36:06.424
My God! What happened?
Are you all right?


498
00:36:08.259 --> 00:36:10.345
Please, don't be hurt.
Are you okay?


499
00:36:10.929 --> 00:36:12.472
Say something.

500
00:36:13.973 --> 00:36:16.768
Beautiful Stephanie.

501
00:36:21.229 --> 00:36:23.857
"S A I N T Prototype
number five...


502
00:36:24.191 --> 00:36:27.486
Nova Robotics. Damon,
Washington". You're a robot?


503
00:36:27.819 --> 00:36:30.030
- Yes.
- I thought you were alive number 5.


504
00:36:30.322 --> 00:36:32.616
I let you tear my house
to shreds and you're a robot!


505
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:36.495
You're a machine from that dumb
war lab place. I'm so stupid.


506
00:36:36.787 --> 00:36:39.497
Stupid: Foolish, gullible,
doltish...


507
00:36:39.705 --> 00:36:41.123
- dumbbell.
- Shut up!


508
00:36:41.415 --> 00:36:43.876
Shut up: Silence, hush,
sit on it, can it.


509
00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:46.170
Am I the jerk of the world?
You're just programmed.


510
00:36:46.462 --> 00:36:49.382
Jerk of the world, turkey,
idiot, pain in the ass.


511
00:36:49.966 --> 00:36:53.169
I hope you're programmed
to pay for the mess you made.


512
00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:59.074
What if there's a reward
out for that thing?


513
00:36:59.107 --> 00:37:01.509
I could take care of as many
animals as I want.


514
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:02.936
Hello.

515
00:37:03.228 --> 00:37:05.897
I'd like to speak to one of your
head Warmongers, please.


516
00:37:06.189 --> 00:37:09.567
Dr. Warmonger, Marner.
I think this may be something.


517
00:37:14.697 --> 00:37:15.990
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>


518
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.158
<i>I'd like you to know
I have one of your robots.</i>


519
00:37:19.034 --> 00:37:20.786
God!

520
00:37:21.036 --> 00:37:23.664
Good.
Yes.


521
00:37:24.498 --> 00:37:26.458
Listen...

522
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.628
thank you very much
for calling.


523
00:37:29.962 --> 00:37:32.171
Our people are
on their way.


524
00:37:34.299 --> 00:37:36.384
Mount up!
We've got it!


525
00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:38.011
Move! Move! Move!

526
00:37:38.303 --> 00:37:41.180
Today, gentleman, today!
Let's go!


527
00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.896
We gotta run away!
Let's go, let's go.


528
00:37:49.948 --> 00:37:52.774
In the meantime,
it's very important...


529
00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:54.860
that you try to keep
a safe distance.


530
00:37:55.152 --> 00:37:57.029
How safe a distance?

531
00:37:57.404 --> 00:38:00.157
Well, see, it's malfunctioning.

532
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.369
We have to disassemble
it and check it out.


533
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.913
It's goofy little gadget.

534
00:38:06.246 --> 00:38:09.165
Try to keep everyone as far away
from it as possible, okay?


535
00:38:09.415 --> 00:38:12.043
Not that it's dangerous
or anything like that.


536
00:38:12.376 --> 00:38:14.837
How much is a contraption
like that worth, anyway?


537
00:38:15.087 --> 00:38:17.423
<i>Worth? I don' know.
A few hundred dollars maybe.</i>


538
00:38:17.715 --> 00:38:19.967
No reward or anything
like that for finding it, is there?


539
00:38:20.301 --> 00:38:24.305
Well, we do have a daily tour
of our facilities here.


540
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.724
<i>You know, I might even be able
to get you a student discount.</i>


541
00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:30.143
- Hey! It's gone!
- Gone?


542
00:38:30.435 --> 00:38:31.770
Wooly mammals.

543
00:38:32.062 --> 00:38:33.730
Sheep.
Sweaters, mittens.


544
00:38:34.022 --> 00:38:37.150
Never mind, I see it. Go back
to your nuclear warheads.


545
00:38:41.947 --> 00:38:44.865
Hey, you, Number Five,
What are you doing?


546
00:38:45.324 --> 00:38:47.149
You're gonna scare
my animals, bozo.


547
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:49.920
Listen, I just called Nova and
they are coming out to get you.


548
00:38:49.972 --> 00:38:52.905
- They'll give you a tune up.
- Tune-up? Input.


549
00:38:52.957 --> 00:38:55.501
They'll take you apart,
find out which screw is loose.


550
00:38:55.553 --> 00:38:59.463
Apart: Undone, dismantle,
dissect, disassemble.


551
00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:00.923
Right.

552
00:39:01.298 --> 00:39:02.757
Jump!

553
00:39:03.716 --> 00:39:08.721
- Look, it's a grasshopper.
- Grasshopper, Orthoptarous insect.


554
00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:11.266
Jump.

555
00:39:11.557 --> 00:39:13.101
That's great.
Okay.


556
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.440
All right, let's go back now.
Come on.


557
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:21.441
Hey!

558
00:39:24.152 --> 00:39:26.405
Damn it! You klutz!
Look what you did.


559
00:39:26.655 --> 00:39:28.115
Error.

560
00:39:28.407 --> 00:39:30.200
Grasshopper disassembled.

561
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.369
Reassemble.

562
00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:34.611
Reassemble.

563
00:39:34.663 --> 00:39:38.416
I can't reassemble him.
You squashed him, he's dead.


564
00:39:38.468 --> 00:39:39.532
Dead?

565
00:39:39.584 --> 00:39:42.910
Right.
Dead as a doornail.


566
00:39:42.962 --> 00:39:46.215
Reassemble, Stephanie.
Reassemble.


567
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.834
I know you don't understand.

568
00:39:50.886 --> 00:39:53.921
But when you're dead,
you're dead.


569
00:39:53.973 --> 00:39:58.101
That's just the way it is.
Dead is forever.


570
00:39:59.311 --> 00:40:03.356
Squash, dead.

571
00:40:03.857 --> 00:40:07.319
Disassemble, dead!

572
00:40:08.028 --> 00:40:11.156
Disassemble, dead!

573
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:13.033
Slow down.

574
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:17.036
- No disassemble.
- Where are you going?


575
00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.415
- Please, escape.
- Oh, my God!


576
00:40:21.707 --> 00:40:23.709
Hey, you!
Get out of my truck.


577
00:40:23.751 --> 00:40:27.588
Hey! Hey! Let me in.
Let me in.


578
00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.830
No! Don't.

579
00:40:29.882 --> 00:40:32.051
You open this door
right now.


580
00:40:34.052 --> 00:40:35.887
Get out of my truck,
you thief.


581
00:40:41.226 --> 00:40:44.395
No, don't start my truck.
You don't know how to drive.


582
00:40:54.404 --> 00:40:56.907
Come back here with my truck,
you big hunk of tin.


583
00:40:56.959 --> 00:40:58.992
You can't take my truck.

584
00:41:15.174 --> 00:41:17.802
You better be heavily insured
because you'll find yourself...


585
00:41:18.552 --> 00:41:20.554
slapped with
a humongous lawsuit!


586
00:41:38.154 --> 00:41:42.576
Newton, I'm seeing a blip
on my scope. Drive slowly.


587
00:41:45.452 --> 00:41:46.912
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.


588
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:50.124
Newton, there it goes.
It's moving at extreme velocipede.


589
00:41:59.008 --> 00:42:01.333
Right of the line.
The right.


590
00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:03.678
Accurate, proper,
correct, appropriate.


591
00:42:03.845 --> 00:42:05.471
My side, over here.
Quickly!


592
00:42:05.722 --> 00:42:06.556
- The right.
- Right.


593
00:42:06.848 --> 00:42:07.974
The right.

594
00:42:13.104 --> 00:42:14.606
Look out! Look out!

595
00:42:17.233 --> 00:42:19.110
My kitchen!

596
00:42:22.696 --> 00:42:23.697
No!

597
00:42:25.616 --> 00:42:28.285
Where she going? I thought
Howard told her to stay put.


598
00:42:28.535 --> 00:42:30.913
Go figure out chicks, man.

599
00:42:32.205 --> 00:42:33.582
Look out!

600
00:42:37.002 --> 00:42:39.087
Oh great! Nice work,
can head.


601
00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:40.755
- Thanks at lot.
- Sorry.


602
00:42:43.758 --> 00:42:46.110
Oh, no. Stop it now!
Stop!


603
00:42:46.953 --> 00:42:49.188
- Turn left or we're going to crash!
- Left!


604
00:42:50.806 --> 00:42:52.808
Turn! Turn!

605
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:54.810
- Fish!
- Look out!


606
00:42:55.019 --> 00:42:56.687
Salmon!
Sushi.


607
00:42:57.313 --> 00:42:59.356
Jeez, Number Five,
we're going to be killed.


608
00:43:00.023 --> 00:43:02.567
- Disassemble.
- Disassemble all over the place.


609
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.362
Disassemble.
No!


610
00:43:12.494 --> 00:43:14.162
Escape! Escape!

611
00:43:14.454 --> 00:43:16.630
Flee! Hide! Refuge!

612
00:43:16.689 --> 00:43:19.450
What are you afraid of?
What's the matter with you?


613
00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:22.378
Nova Robotics.
Disassemble. Dead.


614
00:43:22.628 --> 00:43:24.922
Disassemble Number Five. Dead.

615
00:43:25.256 --> 00:43:27.091
But you can't die.
You're a machine.


616
00:43:27.383 --> 00:43:29.927
- No.
- No, you're not a machine?


617
00:43:30.469 --> 00:43:33.556
- Yes.
- Yes, you are or you're not?


618
00:43:33.639 --> 00:43:35.431
- Yes.
- Yes, what?


619
00:43:35.723 --> 00:43:37.548
Yes, not.

620
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.790
Talk about a malfunction.

621
00:43:39.842 --> 00:43:41.980
Not malfunction, Stephanie.

622
00:43:43.064 --> 00:43:47.610
Number Five is alive.

623
00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:51.322
Just keep going straight.
Just keep going straight.


624
00:43:51.698 --> 00:43:52.990
Ok, Ok, alright...

625
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:55.400
We're getting closer.
Ben, we're getting closer.


626
00:43:55.492 --> 00:43:56.743
I can sense it,
I can sense it.


627
00:43:56.835 --> 00:43:59.287
There they are! You see them?
They're right there.


628
00:44:01.832 --> 00:44:03.917
Nova. Disassemble.

629
00:44:04.042 --> 00:44:05.252
Dead. Disassemble number 5.

630
00:44:05.669 --> 00:44:07.254
Dead.

631
00:44:07.588 --> 00:44:10.590
Girlie, girlie, come quick!
Girlie, danger! Come on!


632
00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:12.592
No, no disassemble,

633
00:44:12.884 --> 00:44:15.303
No disassemble,
Number Five.


634
00:44:16.345 --> 00:44:17.763
Come on, you!

635
00:44:18.681 --> 00:44:20.808
What planet is this guy from?

636
00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.092
No, no disassemble.

637
00:44:23.144 --> 00:44:25.177
Oh, number 5, don't be scared.

638
00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:27.815
You just wait here a second.
I'll be right back.


639
00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:37.616
Come on, Number one.
Come on. Very good.


640
00:44:38.033 --> 00:44:40.118
Careful. Moving nicely.

641
00:44:40.368 --> 00:44:42.162
Jeez, another one.

642
00:44:42.254 --> 00:44:44.112
How many of these guys
have you got, anyway?


643
00:44:44.164 --> 00:44:47.541
- You are a girl, right?
- Yes, as far as I know.


644
00:44:47.593 --> 00:44:50.294
Hi.
How you doing?


645
00:44:50.711 --> 00:44:52.713
Your little brother's hiding
in my truck.


646
00:44:53.047 --> 00:44:55.341
I have seen some
strange bizarre drivers...


647
00:44:55.674 --> 00:44:58.344
but you may be
awarded the cake.


648
00:44:58.636 --> 00:45:01.347
Me? Talk to your robot.
He did the driving.


649
00:45:01.639 --> 00:45:03.463
Did you say the robot
drove the truck?


650
00:45:03.515 --> 00:45:06.424
Yeah, that's right, chum.
That's exactly what I'm saying.


651
00:45:06.476 --> 00:45:09.437
Oh, bull dyke, you cannot hold
your water with that story, girl.


652
00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:11.270
Hey, I was there, okay?

653
00:45:11.271 --> 00:45:13.907
You're sure you weren't doing any
steering or anything like that?


654
00:45:13.942 --> 00:45:15.558
Yeah, I like to drive off cliffs.

655
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.696
- There's no way my robot could have driven.
- Are you calling me a liar?


656
00:45:18.748 --> 00:45:22.866
No, but maybe you
have amnesia.


657
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:27.663
Newton! We are wasting
valueless time.


658
00:45:28.038 --> 00:45:29.998
So what are these guys
used for, anyway?


659
00:45:30.249 --> 00:45:32.584
- It's top-secret crap.
- That's what I figured.


660
00:45:32.918 --> 00:45:35.045
Dr. Love, I'd like to get
my robot back.


661
00:45:35.337 --> 00:45:37.756
He knows that,
but he's scared.


662
00:45:38.048 --> 00:45:39.967
It's a machine.
It doesn't get scared.


663
00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:42.260
It doesn't get happy.
It doesn't get sad.


664
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:45.763
- It just runs programs.
- How do you explain that?


665
00:45:51.269 --> 00:45:52.343
You see?

666
00:45:52.395 --> 00:45:54.939
He's scared that if you take him
apart he's going to die.


667
00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.123
- Where'd you hear that?
- Number Five told me.


668
00:45:57.126 --> 00:45:58.842
He'd tell you if you'd
just talk to him.


669
00:45:58.894 --> 00:46:00.860
That's what I've been
trying to do for...


670
00:46:00.912 --> 00:46:03.822
No, I mean with your mouth.
Watch.


671
00:46:03.823 --> 00:46:04.972
Okay, Ben,
this is the plan.


672
00:46:04.973 --> 00:46:05.978
Number Five!

673
00:46:06.032 --> 00:46:08.702
Number Five!
Come on out. It's okay.


674
00:46:08.754 --> 00:46:10.068
- Is it cool?
- It's okay.


675
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:12.362
These guys aren't going
to hurt you. They're friends.


676
00:46:12.389 --> 00:46:14.854
- No disassemble?
- No, no.


677
00:46:14.906 --> 00:46:17.418
They just want
to talk to you.


678
00:46:22.506 --> 00:46:25.384
Come forward.
Do you remember forward?


679
00:46:25.436 --> 00:46:27.334
- Forward.
- That's it, come on.


680
00:46:27.386 --> 00:46:29.555
I can't believe it.
It's listening to her, not to us.


681
00:46:29.607 --> 00:46:32.266
I am standing here
beside myself.


682
00:46:32.318 --> 00:46:34.091
Okay! Now.

683
00:46:34.143 --> 00:46:36.436
You just tell them
what you told me.


684
00:46:36.488 --> 00:46:40.356
Number Five
not just robot.


685
00:46:40.408 --> 00:46:44.027
There it is! Move out!

686
00:46:44.152 --> 00:46:46.070
Move! Move!

687
00:46:46.863 --> 00:46:48.323
Move out!

688
00:46:48.615 --> 00:46:51.117
Go! Go! Go!
Today, gentleman, today!


689
00:46:53.035 --> 00:46:55.078
- Down, girlie!
- What, are you nuts?


690
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.548
Stop! Please.

691
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.717
I have clearance!
I have clearance!


692
00:47:09.134 --> 00:47:10.500
Bend down!

693
00:47:10.552 --> 00:47:12.001
You quit doing that!

694
00:47:12.053 --> 00:47:14.847
You think I'm doing this for
my own self-gratification?


695
00:47:30.195 --> 00:47:32.864
Go!

696
00:47:42.874 --> 00:47:45.168
No, Don't! Stop!

697
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.378
Stephanie!

698
00:47:49.505 --> 00:47:50.798
They're killing him!

699
00:47:50.923 --> 00:47:52.341
Hold your fire!

700
00:47:53.384 --> 00:47:55.344
Damn it, stop!
Hold your fire!


701
00:47:55.636 --> 00:47:57.555
Hold your fire!

702
00:48:00.724 --> 00:48:02.810
Number Five alive!

703
00:48:04.186 --> 00:48:05.437
Stephanie!

704
00:48:05.479 --> 00:48:07.230
Number Five,
I'm sorry.


705
00:48:08.398 --> 00:48:11.025
Steph-an-ia...

706
00:48:11.317 --> 00:48:13.142
You're paralyzing him.

707
00:48:13.194 --> 00:48:16.781
I cut all his power. You can
load it on the truck now.


708
00:48:16.833 --> 00:48:18.533
What the hell
is the matter with you...


709
00:48:18.658 --> 00:48:20.326
you four-eyed idiot.

710
00:48:20.618 --> 00:48:22.307
What an asshole.

711
00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:23.996
I heard that.

712
00:48:24.121 --> 00:48:27.124
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where are you taking him?


713
00:48:27.176 --> 00:48:28.500
Okay, I want you guys to...

714
00:48:28.552 --> 00:48:29.491
He's not being a him.

715
00:48:29.543 --> 00:48:32.504
It's only being wires and several
mechanisms and other such...


716
00:48:32.556 --> 00:48:33.787
machine type apparatus...

717
00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:36.925
<i>for the Pete of sake.
The sake of Pete...</i>


718
00:48:36.977 --> 00:48:39.042
No, you have to turn
him back on.


719
00:48:39.094 --> 00:48:41.471
He was talking before
like a real person.


720
00:48:41.523 --> 00:48:42.545
Couldn't you see that?

721
00:48:42.597 --> 00:48:44.957
Look, lady, all I could see was that
something mechanical...


722
00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:46.858
is screwed up and
I'm going to fix it, okay?


723
00:48:46.861 --> 00:48:48.686
Ok, fine! You fix it,
Einstein.


724
00:48:48.738 --> 00:48:50.177
I plan to.

725
00:48:50.229 --> 00:48:51.929
And it's Crosby.
Newton Crosby.


726
00:48:51.981 --> 00:48:53.524
- Stephanie Speck.
- Nice meeting you.


727
00:48:53.576 --> 00:48:54.515
Same here.

728
00:48:54.567 --> 00:48:55.933
- Ben? Ben?
- Sir! Stat!


729
00:48:55.934 --> 00:48:58.094
I want you to go with Number Five
and make sure they do not...


730
00:48:58.095 --> 00:49:00.028
switch off the memory.
Do you understand what I'm saying?


731
00:49:00.029 --> 00:49:01.057
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.


732
00:49:01.058 --> 00:49:02.522
Bye-bye, goofy woman.

733
00:49:02.574 --> 00:49:05.243
I enjoyed repeatedly throwing
you to the ground.


734
00:49:05.295 --> 00:49:06.995
No mistake.
Stat.


735
00:49:08.496 --> 00:49:10.540
You can call me
if you want to.


736
00:49:10.592 --> 00:49:11.739
Call you?

737
00:49:11.791 --> 00:49:13.460
To let me know
if Number Five's okay.


738
00:49:14.586 --> 00:49:16.213
Okay, maybe I will.

739
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:18.839
Well, don't do me
any favors, Jack.


740
00:49:27.973 --> 00:49:28.881
So there we are.

741
00:49:28.933 --> 00:49:30.674
We're right on top of
Mount St. Helen's...


742
00:49:30.726 --> 00:49:33.854
- and we've got two flat tires.
- Two, that's bad.


743
00:49:33.906 --> 00:49:35.898
Now Hazel's running around
the parking lot.


744
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:37.282
Hazel.

745
00:49:37.357 --> 00:49:39.442
<i>She's waving
her credit card...</i>


746
00:49:41.319 --> 00:49:42.737
It's life.
It's life.


747
00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:45.657
That is very funny
American name, Hazel.


748
00:49:45.865 --> 00:49:48.826
Well, It's sure not one you
can hear much anymore.


749
00:49:49.118 --> 00:49:50.745
I never heard it
before I met her.


750
00:49:51.037 --> 00:49:53.748
All except for witch hazel,
who I think she's named after.


751
00:49:54.207 --> 00:49:58.168
- I thought it was a nut.
- That's an old name.


752
00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.711
It's an old family name.

753
00:49:59.762 --> 00:50:01.538
They were from
some place in Europe...


754
00:50:01.588 --> 00:50:04.508
and there's always a Hazel in it.
In her family.


755
00:50:05.008 --> 00:50:07.886
I guess there's always some
Hazel in Europe.


756
00:50:10.639 --> 00:50:14.809
She's running around trying
to buy somebody's spare tire.


757
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:18.020
She's showing people her ID's
to prove the checks are good...


758
00:50:18.072 --> 00:50:20.064
like a branch of our bank
where they could check.


759
00:50:21.566 --> 00:50:25.152
She was even trying to swap some
souvenirs when she was gotten.


760
00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:28.030
All of which were made from
the ashes of the volcano...


761
00:50:29.323 --> 00:50:31.300
Did you get a piece of ash?

762
00:50:34.436 --> 00:50:37.122
So, of course nobody's going to sell
her a spare tire...


763
00:50:37.174 --> 00:50:39.316
after what we just told
them happened to us.


764
00:50:39.368 --> 00:50:41.459
Especially the way
she was telling them.


765
00:50:41.535 --> 00:50:43.928
And she was trying to convince
them I wasn't a bad driver...


766
00:50:43.962 --> 00:50:45.213
which I'm not.

767
00:50:45.463 --> 00:50:48.049
But, she was doing it by telling
them how thin the road is.


768
00:50:48.101 --> 00:50:50.634
You know, and how curvy and
how many rocks there were...


769
00:50:50.686 --> 00:50:52.094
and how big
and sharp they are.


770
00:50:52.186 --> 00:50:54.379
And all the time I know
what these people are thinking.


771
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:56.307
They gotta drive down
the same road...


772
00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:33.050
- Sir?
- Yes, sir?


773
00:51:33.258 --> 00:51:34.551
Sir?

774
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.179
Oh, my goodness gracious!

775
00:51:37.229 --> 00:51:39.056
It can't shoot us with
that laser, can it?


776
00:51:39.097 --> 00:51:40.797
I am not knowing.

777
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:43.851
- Would he kill me if I stopped?
- Who is to say?


778
00:51:43.903 --> 00:51:45.520
Would he kill me
if I don't stop?


779
00:51:45.572 --> 00:51:47.605
Again I am shrugging.

780
00:51:47.657 --> 00:51:49.273
I'm stopping.

781
00:51:51.234 --> 00:51:52.349
Good choice.

782
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:55.071
Number Five furious,
livid, perturbed.


783
00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:59.033
Hold it right there.

784
00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:02.494
Colt 45.
Semi automatic.


785
00:52:03.537 --> 00:52:05.069
Play Doh.

786
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.122
What do we do now?

787
00:52:06.373 --> 00:52:10.001
I don't know about you, but
I'm planning to scream and run.


788
00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:12.170
Good answer.

789
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.556
What is he doing?

790
00:53:00.716 --> 00:53:02.301
There it goes
Very good.


791
00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:04.386
You earned that one.

792
00:53:22.361 --> 00:53:24.697
Hi, honey!
What is for dinner?


793
00:53:46.635 --> 00:53:48.011
Bingo!

794
00:53:55.684 --> 00:53:57.623
<i>Practice, Easy Three,
to third and fourth.</i>


795
00:53:57.675 --> 00:53:59.563
<i>Lucky's seventh and
Pacer in the rear.</i>


796
00:53:59.897 --> 00:54:02.816
<i>Now it's Double Trouble making
a move on the outside rail...</i>


797
00:54:02.868 --> 00:54:05.636
<i>and Practice right behind.
Jimmy's Folly is calling...</i>


798
00:54:05.688 --> 00:54:08.404
<i>That's the serpent and the devil...
same on him.</i>


799
00:54:08.905 --> 00:54:10.240
<i>And the devil is the...</i>

800
00:55:02.873 --> 00:55:03.999
Ready, aim!

801
00:55:05.917 --> 00:55:07.210
What happened?

802
00:55:09.921 --> 00:55:12.299
I hope you took the grass
out of the glove compartment.


803
00:55:13.216 --> 00:55:15.260
Anything wrong, officer?

804
00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:18.513
There's gotta be a logical
explanation for all of this.


805
00:55:19.097 --> 00:55:21.765
Maybe, if it was programmed
to think it was alive...


806
00:55:21.817 --> 00:55:23.267
then it could act alive.

807
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:25.936
Maybe you've created another
Frankfurter's monster.


808
00:55:26.387 --> 00:55:28.814
Do I look like the kind of a man
who can actually hear his...


809
00:55:28.866 --> 00:55:31.682
Howard I think that something
incredible is going on.


810
00:55:31.734 --> 00:55:33.652
What's going on is that we've
got a red alert on your hands?


811
00:55:33.653 --> 00:55:34.661
No, it's not dangerous.

812
00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:36.831
We just have to find
Number Five, get some answers.


813
00:55:36.874 --> 00:55:38.230
There's only one answer.

814
00:55:38.282 --> 00:55:40.400
All right, blast it off the
face of the earth, right?


815
00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:42.744
Doctor... how many kids you got?

816
00:55:43.536 --> 00:55:44.360
None.

817
00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:45.954
Well, let me tell you
something, Doctor.


818
00:55:45.955 --> 00:55:48.725
I got three of them.
Three dandy little Schroeders.


819
00:55:48.802 --> 00:55:50.798
And I want them to be adults,
not barbecued.


820
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:52.743
So don't you give me
any of your bullshit.


821
00:55:52.795 --> 00:55:54.923
That having been said, I think
I've got to alert the media.


822
00:55:54.975 --> 00:55:56.624
Now Schroeder's going to handle
this from now on...


823
00:55:56.633 --> 00:55:57.799
and you stay
at your terminal.


824
00:55:57.841 --> 00:55:59.124
Howard, this is ridiculous.

825
00:55:59.176 --> 00:56:00.750
Think of it as
a full-scale field test.


826
00:56:00.802 --> 00:56:02.461
Leave your terminal and
you're out of a job.


827
00:56:02.513 --> 00:56:04.339
Howard, we are going to have
to put up some roadblocks...


828
00:56:04.431 --> 00:56:05.849
and I'm going to
need some Hueys.


829
00:56:05.901 --> 00:56:06.840
Some what?

830
00:56:06.892 --> 00:56:09.102
Helicopters, Howard.
Jesus Christ!


831
00:56:09.311 --> 00:56:11.772
- I thought they were choppers.
- Now they're called Hueys.


832
00:56:11.824 --> 00:56:13.857
Well, why wasn't I notified?

833
00:56:18.653 --> 00:56:20.196
Okay, this is the plan...

834
00:56:32.583 --> 00:56:34.501
- Stephanie Speck.
- Yes.


835
00:56:34.553 --> 00:56:35.366
We're from KJMB News.

836
00:56:35.418 --> 00:56:38.129
Can you please tell us something
about the Nova robot?


837
00:56:38.181 --> 00:56:39.923
- Were you scared?
- No, no.


838
00:56:40.382 --> 00:56:41.925
<i>Did he try to molest
you in any way?</i>


839
00:56:42.175 --> 00:56:43.927
<i>No, he's not that kind
of a robot.</i>


840
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.055
<i>Do you know that there's a $25
thousand reward for anyone that turns it in?</i>


841
00:56:47.107 --> 00:56:48.463
<i>No, I don't know anything
about it.</i>


842
00:56:48.515 --> 00:56:50.725
<i>I don't know where he is.
Please, leave me alone.</i>


843
00:56:50.777 --> 00:56:52.017
<i>Why didn't you go
to the police?</i>


844
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.603
You know where it is.

845
00:56:56.063 --> 00:56:59.859
For 25 thousand dollars I'm damn
well going to know where it is too.


846
00:57:07.867 --> 00:57:09.450
Frank?

847
00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:13.329
Is that you, Frank?

848
00:57:13.872 --> 00:57:16.124
I'm warning you,
I'm armed and dangerous.


849
00:57:20.712 --> 00:57:23.798
Disguise, camouflage. Hi!

850
00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.885
Number Five!
You got away?


851
00:57:27.135 --> 00:57:27.958
Yep.

852
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:29.428
You can't stay here!
They'll find you!


853
00:57:30.429 --> 00:57:33.348
Stephanie.
Changed color.


854
00:57:37.644 --> 00:57:42.608
Attractive,
nice software.


855
00:57:42.733 --> 00:57:45.381
You sure don't talk
like a machine.


856
00:57:45.433 --> 00:57:47.564
Alive, Stephanie.
Number Five alive.


857
00:57:47.616 --> 00:57:49.532
Yes, I know you think
you're alive...


858
00:57:49.584 --> 00:57:51.449
but those guys who built
you say no way.


859
00:57:51.949 --> 00:57:53.534
I don't know what
to think anymore.


860
00:57:53.743 --> 00:57:55.036
I know it's not safe
for you here.


861
00:57:55.203 --> 00:57:56.662
Go on.
Get out of here. Go on!


862
00:57:59.123 --> 00:58:03.336
Solitude, isolation. Alone.

863
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:06.338
Number Five, come on!

864
00:58:07.088 --> 00:58:09.038
Lonely bum.

865
00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:10.874
Number five, please.

866
00:58:10.926 --> 00:58:14.346
If I went to jail, who would
take care of my animals?


867
00:58:14.398 --> 00:58:15.972
You sure wouldn't.

868
00:58:16.848 --> 00:58:18.214
What are you doing?

869
00:58:18.266 --> 00:58:21.311
"A can of soup.
A meal in itself."


870
00:58:22.978 --> 00:58:26.106
All right, you can stay,
but just for tonight.


871
00:58:26.232 --> 00:58:26.972
Excellent.

872
00:58:27.024 --> 00:58:28.651
If they catch you
I don't know you.


873
00:58:29.485 --> 00:58:30.778
You got it.

874
00:58:30.986 --> 00:58:32.196
Okay, Ben, let's do it.

875
00:58:32.947 --> 00:58:35.307
This is the very first vehicle
I've stolen in the US of A.


876
00:58:35.308 --> 00:58:36.783
Me, too. It's kind of exciting,
Isn't it?


877
00:58:36.784 --> 00:58:38.744
With excitement like this,
who is needing enemas?


878
00:58:38.754 --> 00:58:39.984
Look Ben, we're doing
the right thing.


879
00:58:40.036 --> 00:58:42.831
If they trash Number Five, we'll
never find out what happened.


880
00:58:43.832 --> 00:58:45.792
Dr. Marner!

881
00:58:45.834 --> 00:58:47.527
I knew you would try this.

882
00:58:47.528 --> 00:58:48.902
You're not going
to make it, fellas.


883
00:58:48.903 --> 00:58:51.364
There are soldiers out there
with bazooka's and choppers...


884
00:58:51.391 --> 00:58:52.955
or whatever the hell
they call them now.


885
00:58:53.007 --> 00:58:56.261
We've got to try anyway. You're
a scientist, you understand.


886
00:58:56.313 --> 00:58:58.095
I'm a business man.
I'm not a scientist anymore.


887
00:58:58.345 --> 00:58:59.346
Damn you, Howard.

888
00:58:59.596 --> 00:59:01.932
20 years ago you would have
chauffeured us in this situation.


889
00:59:02.057 --> 00:59:03.423
Well, times have changed.

890
00:59:03.475 --> 00:59:05.759
Because that was then
and this is now.


891
00:59:05.811 --> 00:59:07.980
All right, now come on.
Let's get back upstairs.


892
00:59:08.689 --> 00:59:10.274
What the heck, Newton.

893
00:59:10.524 --> 00:59:12.943
Let us punch the sack.
Tomorrow is the next day.


894
00:59:13.527 --> 00:59:14.987
No.

895
00:59:16.445 --> 00:59:17.989
No.

896
00:59:18.197 --> 00:59:20.032
No. I'm going.

897
00:59:21.534 --> 00:59:23.119
Howard, shoot me
if you have to.


898
00:59:23.171 --> 00:59:24.162
Don't think I won't.

899
00:59:24.163 --> 00:59:25.614
Come on, Howard,
you know you're bluffing.


900
00:59:25.615 --> 00:59:27.232
Lord Rama, Lord Rama.

901
00:59:27.248 --> 00:59:28.916
Lord Rama,
Lord Rama, grant my wish.


902
00:59:31.169 --> 00:59:32.159
All right, I'm bluffing.

903
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:34.337
Ok, thank you. Come on, Ben,
let's get out of here.


904
00:59:34.389 --> 00:59:35.672
Right. Very good.

905
00:59:37.924 --> 00:59:40.886
It doesn't matter anyway, the
doors are electronically sealed.


906
00:59:41.261 --> 00:59:42.095
Don't be too sure.

907
00:59:47.058 --> 00:59:48.768
Then you'll have
to drive over me.


908
00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.233
That's the way
it's gotta be.


909
00:59:50.285 --> 00:59:51.646
This is going to be
very messy.


910
00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:54.356
This is how I get
the big bucks.


911
01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.389
Yeah.

912
01:01:00.378 --> 01:01:02.129
Oh, very good.

913
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:04.048
Great.

914
01:01:04.257 --> 01:01:06.424
Oh! Hey, thanks.

915
01:01:06.925 --> 01:01:09.302
Okay, turn off the TV.

916
01:01:09.386 --> 01:01:11.179
- It's time for bed.
- No.


917
01:01:17.644 --> 01:01:20.272
No, turn off the TV.
It's time for bed.


918
01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:24.733
Come on Steph, lighten up.
Let's give it a whirl.


919
01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:26.443
- Hey!
- Ya!


920
01:01:27.528 --> 01:01:31.031
- Listen, you, it's three a.m.
- It's early.


921
01:01:31.282 --> 01:01:32.689
I mean, don't you ever
get enough?


922
01:01:32.741 --> 01:01:35.264
Wrestling, roller derby,
Jimmy Swaggert...


923
01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:37.788
The Three Stooges.
Give it a rest, will ya?


924
01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.416
Larry, Curly, Moe.

925
01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:44.878
Hey, know what?
You're not a bad dancer.


926
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.588
Dancing fool.

927
01:01:50.091 --> 01:01:51.718
- Big finish.
- Right.


928
01:01:52.051 --> 01:01:54.512
And then I'm going to bed
and in the morning...


929
01:01:54.564 --> 01:01:56.723
you have to find yourself
a new home.


930
01:01:56.775 --> 01:01:59.933
This home.
Stephanie home.


931
01:01:59.985 --> 01:02:01.424
Number Five home.

932
01:02:01.476 --> 01:02:04.396
Oh, Number Five, you don't know
what you're saying.


933
01:02:04.448 --> 01:02:06.565
Number Five know.

934
01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:15.949
"More than a woman."

935
01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.995
"More than a woman to me."

936
01:02:21.047 --> 01:02:22.455
Oh, Number Five.

937
01:02:27.293 --> 01:02:29.420
"More than a woman to me."

938
01:02:39.846 --> 01:02:41.848
<i>I'll croon</i>

939
01:02:42.599 --> 01:02:44.893
<i>A little song
About the moon</i>


940
01:02:46.478 --> 01:02:49.356
<i>And when I'm finished
With my crooning</i>


941
01:02:49.815 --> 01:02:51.691
<i>On my knees I'll fall</i>

942
01:02:51.942 --> 01:02:54.693
<i>My life, my love, my all</i>

943
01:02:56.529 --> 01:03:00.699
Okay, to make these
golden fluffy pancakes...


944
01:03:00.825 --> 01:03:04.662
add flour, milk...

945
01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.121
and eggs.

946
01:03:12.669 --> 01:03:15.421
Mix thoroughly.

947
01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:22.637
Still lumpy.

948
01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:30.352
Marvelous.

949
01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:33.355
For crisp, yet moist
potatoes...


950
01:03:33.814 --> 01:03:36.400
brown on one side,
then turn over.


951
01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:42.531
This will be
some good slop.


952
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.825
Is something burning?

953
01:03:45.409 --> 01:03:47.703
- Morning.
- Oh! Number Five!


954
01:03:47.755 --> 01:03:49.944
- Good morning.
- Sleep well?


955
01:03:49.996 --> 01:03:52.248
You're making me breakfast,
aren't you?


956
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.749
Pancakes surprise.

957
01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:56.586
Oh, Number Five,
you're so sweet.


958
01:03:58.171 --> 01:03:59.589
Oh, no.

959
01:04:01.507 --> 01:04:04.093
It's the revenge
of the Mutations.


960
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.804
Listen, why don't you turn that
stove off and I'll be right back.


961
01:04:08.472 --> 01:04:10.974
Wait!
It'll get cold.


962
01:04:13.894 --> 01:04:15.103
What are you
doing here, creep?


963
01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.553
Oh, good morning.

964
01:04:16.605 --> 01:04:18.607
I saw you on TV last night
on the news.


965
01:04:18.899 --> 01:04:20.358
Yeah, I'm a real
big celebrity.


966
01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:22.569
You know there's
a reward out for that robot?


967
01:04:22.694 --> 01:04:24.320
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

968
01:04:24.578 --> 01:04:26.071
No, I don't know
anything about it.


969
01:04:26.113 --> 01:04:27.448
Why don't you get off
my property?


970
01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:41.003
- Steph...
- Leave me alone.


971
01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:42.629
- Where is it?
- It's not here.


972
01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:46.216
- Get out or I'll call the cops.
- Stephanie, breakfast.


973
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.219
Pancakes, hash browns.

974
01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.628
Twenty five thousand dollars.

975
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.266
Don't worry, we'll split it.
Twenty for me and five for you.


976
01:04:55.318 --> 01:04:57.252
Listen, you gotta talk
computer to him.


977
01:04:57.253 --> 01:04:58.629
Tell him exactly what
you're doing...


978
01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.646
exactly where you're going, or
he's not going to move an inch.


979
01:05:00.896 --> 01:05:02.898
Number Five, this is Frank.

980
01:05:04.149 --> 01:05:07.569
How, Robot.
Me friend.


981
01:05:08.612 --> 01:05:10.614
No, talk computer,
not Apache.


982
01:05:11.156 --> 01:05:14.076
Fresh O.J.?
Not from concentrate.


983
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:19.956
Thanks.

984
01:05:20.081 --> 01:05:21.541
Listen, what do you say
we jump in my car...


985
01:05:21.593 --> 01:05:23.292
we'll take a ride.
I'll take you home.


986
01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.837
Tell him where home is.

987
01:05:26.087 --> 01:05:27.880
Home is Nova.

988
01:05:28.548 --> 01:05:29.799
Nova! No!

989
01:05:30.091 --> 01:05:31.488
No disassemble!

990
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.885
Number Five, run!

991
01:05:32.927 --> 01:05:34.679
Come on, treads,
don't fail me now.


992
01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:37.827
- Run, get away now!
- Get off me!


993
01:05:37.879 --> 01:05:40.465
You tricked me,
you little bitch!


994
01:05:40.517 --> 01:05:42.894
Does this mean I don't
get my five thousand dollars?


995
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:45.105
Forget it! Forget it!

996
01:05:45.522 --> 01:05:47.866
He can go thirty miles an hour,
you big stupid jerk.


997
01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.474
I'll show you, how
stupid I am.


998
01:05:49.526 --> 01:05:52.445
- Guess who's going to help me catch it.
- No, I'd rather die first!


999
01:05:52.497 --> 01:05:53.613
Where the hell is my car?

1000
01:05:55.781 --> 01:05:57.408
Hi.

1001
01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.946
Piece of cake.

1002
01:06:03.998 --> 01:06:06.250
Oh, my God!
My car!


1003
01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:09.587
- Oh, way to go, Number Five.
- Uh-oh!


1004
01:06:13.506 --> 01:06:14.883
Oh, my God, no!

1005
01:06:15.133 --> 01:06:16.593
Number Five, look out!

1006
01:06:19.095 --> 01:06:22.515
"Say Pilgrim, that like to
parted my hair."


1007
01:06:22.599 --> 01:06:25.894
"If you wanna play rough,
I can sure oblige ya."


1008
01:06:28.646 --> 01:06:30.231
How can he do that?

1009
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:39.521
"Frankie...

1010
01:06:39.573 --> 01:06:43.535
you broke the unwritten law.
You ratted on your friends.


1011
01:06:44.369 --> 01:06:46.162
And when you do that, Frankie...

1012
01:06:46.214 --> 01:06:47.956
your enemies don't respect you...

1013
01:06:48.008 --> 01:06:50.379
you got no friends no more.

1014
01:06:50.431 --> 01:06:52.752
You got nobody Frankie."

1015
01:06:53.503 --> 01:06:54.962
Pretty good, huh?

1016
01:06:55.671 --> 01:06:57.799
Unbelievable.

1017
01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.759
Look out!

1018
01:07:00.968 --> 01:07:02.804
How about that,
a goddamn robot?


1019
01:07:05.097 --> 01:07:07.350
Stephanie, get off me!

1020
01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:09.559
Stephanie, that's it.

1021
01:07:10.352 --> 01:07:12.562
No!
Not disassemble Stephanie.


1022
01:07:16.483 --> 01:07:17.692
No!

1023
01:07:41.841 --> 01:07:43.984
I'm calling Nova, and I'm
calling the cops.


1024
01:07:44.092 --> 01:07:46.419
And as for you, you
little pain-in-the-neck...


1025
01:07:46.427 --> 01:07:49.055
you better not come crawling
back to me, because now it's over!


1026
01:07:49.347 --> 01:07:50.348
Good.

1027
01:07:51.432 --> 01:07:52.423
Okay, come on.

1028
01:07:52.475 --> 01:07:55.144
They're gonna be after you.
We gotta get out here, now.


1029
01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.817
So now I am having no job
to speak about.


1030
01:08:02.025 --> 01:08:03.694
I will have to smack
the sidewalk.


1031
01:08:03.695 --> 01:08:05.763
I'm not going to let it happen.
You're not going to get fired...


1032
01:08:05.764 --> 01:08:07.057
I'm not going to get fired...

1033
01:08:07.114 --> 01:08:09.324
because we're going to find
Number Five intact.


1034
01:08:09.376 --> 01:08:10.190
Very good.

1035
01:08:10.242 --> 01:08:11.743
<i>That's right, Howard.</i>

1036
01:08:11.869 --> 01:08:13.787
- It's Scrotum?
- Schoreder.


1037
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:15.278
Same thing.

1038
01:08:15.279 --> 01:08:16.287
<i>Now all roads are blocked</i>

1039
01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:19.126
<i>her only chance is
a back road into the hills.</i>


1040
01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:21.294
<i>We'll concentrate our search there.</i>

1041
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:27.550
Where the hell are we?

1042
01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:29.469
"New York City".

1043
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:31.637
No, I don't think so.
Try the other side.


1044
01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:32.638
Ok.

1045
01:08:34.098 --> 01:08:35.892
Oh. Texaco.

1046
01:08:36.142 --> 01:08:37.143
Great.

1047
01:08:37.602 --> 01:08:40.187
Well, I'm lost.
I don't know where to go.


1048
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.397
- Strategy.
- What about it?


1049
01:08:42.449 --> 01:08:43.940
Need some, quick.

1050
01:08:44.191 --> 01:08:46.902
Right, what we need is somebody
to make those bozos listen.


1051
01:08:48.153 --> 01:08:50.155
- Not bozos.
- What?


1052
01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:51.364
One bozo.

1053
01:08:51.573 --> 01:08:53.658
Newton Crosby, PhD.

1054
01:08:53.909 --> 01:08:56.243
Hey, malfunction, he's the enemy.
He can't help.


1055
01:08:56.994 --> 01:08:58.193
Couldn't hurt.

1056
01:08:58.245 --> 01:09:00.847
You know, I know why Number
Five took a liking to her.


1057
01:09:00.923 --> 01:09:03.793
If it did have that capability,
which it doesn't, but if it did.


1058
01:09:03.845 --> 01:09:06.160
I mean, I think she's pretty,
don't you think?


1059
01:09:06.212 --> 01:09:09.381
I am thinking she's a virgin.
Or at least she used to be.


1060
01:09:09.924 --> 01:09:11.300
<i>Hello Crosby.</i>

1061
01:09:11.425 --> 01:09:12.499
I think it's Howard.

1062
01:09:12.551 --> 01:09:15.136
<i>I know you're listening,
so pick up the mike.</i>


1063
01:09:15.188 --> 01:09:17.222
This is Crosby.
How's your back, Howard?


1064
01:09:17.274 --> 01:09:18.755
Just hunky-dory, thanks.

1065
01:09:18.807 --> 01:09:21.184
I just swore out some warrants
for your arrest.


1066
01:09:21.267 --> 01:09:22.175
Good golly.

1067
01:09:22.227 --> 01:09:25.396
<i>But because I'm a nice guy, I'm
going to give you one last chance.</i>


1068
01:09:25.688 --> 01:09:28.107
<i>I got a phone call from that loony
in the lunch wagon.</i>


1069
01:09:28.159 --> 01:09:29.359
<i>She wants to see you.</i>

1070
01:09:30.068 --> 01:09:32.101
<i>- Only you.
- She does?</i>


1071
01:09:32.153 --> 01:09:34.655
Oh! Her pants are blazing for
you Newton Crosby.


1072
01:09:35.113 --> 01:09:38.117
Will you grow up. I'll be there,
Howard, on one condition.


1073
01:09:38.169 --> 01:09:39.493
No Schroeder.
Is it a deal?


1074
01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:40.744
<i>It's a deal.</i>

1075
01:09:41.036 --> 01:09:43.372
<i>- Where does she want to meet?
- The Black Lion Inn.</i>


1076
01:09:53.965 --> 01:09:55.299
Good luck, sir.

1077
01:10:18.238 --> 01:10:19.489
Hi.

1078
01:10:20.532 --> 01:10:22.273
He's hidden far away.

1079
01:10:22.325 --> 01:10:23.910
He's scared of you guys,
you know.


1080
01:10:25.537 --> 01:10:27.079
Do I get him or not?

1081
01:10:27.121 --> 01:10:29.290
First we talk... inside.

1082
01:10:33.043 --> 01:10:35.327
My ex-boyfriend used to
bring me here.


1083
01:10:35.379 --> 01:10:37.798
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Fine, good to see you.


1084
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.509
- Yeah, ex. So what?
- Ah, nothing.


1085
01:10:42.928 --> 01:10:44.805
Okay, here's the deal.

1086
01:10:45.054 --> 01:10:47.307
Number Five is alive.

1087
01:10:48.308 --> 01:10:52.312
I mean, he is really alive,
like you and me, you see?


1088
01:10:52.364 --> 01:10:54.345
I understand. They can seem
quite life-like...


1089
01:10:54.397 --> 01:10:57.317
but they're still machines.
Just like your stereo...


1090
01:10:57.369 --> 01:10:58.594
or your vacuum cleaner.

1091
01:10:58.646 --> 01:10:59.819
No, I know he's a machine.

1092
01:10:59.944 --> 01:11:02.353
You're a machine, I'm a
machine. We're alive.


1093
01:11:02.405 --> 01:11:05.616
How it happens, who the hell
knows. But it has happened.


1094
01:11:05.668 --> 01:11:07.117
Okay.

1095
01:11:07.576 --> 01:11:11.830
Believe me, I'm not against the
idea that happen, but you see...


1096
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.208
I built the machine from scratch.

1097
01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:17.085
And alive, alive...

1098
01:11:17.252 --> 01:11:18.285
it doesn't compute.

1099
01:11:18.337 --> 01:11:23.132
I know. It's not your everyday
event. But somehow, it's true.


1100
01:11:25.134 --> 01:11:28.387
As Guerrero steps to the plate.
The pitch...


1101
01:11:29.263 --> 01:11:32.683
and it's a long line drive
to deep left center.


1102
01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:35.102
Hyde is going back for it!
He's...


1103
01:11:40.357 --> 01:11:42.901
Robot alert!
Number Five located.


1104
01:11:43.527 --> 01:11:46.321
Engage in capture,
do not destroy.


1105
01:11:47.989 --> 01:11:49.991
Have you thought about
what you're doing?


1106
01:11:50.043 --> 01:11:51.900
Trying to hide something
like this?


1107
01:11:51.952 --> 01:11:55.956
If you want to help Number Five,
let me have it back.


1108
01:11:56.008 --> 01:11:58.249
It's malfunctioning.
It needs to be repaired.


1109
01:11:58.301 --> 01:12:00.918
Life is not a malfunction.

1110
01:12:06.382 --> 01:12:08.592
Number Five axis four twenty-nine.

1111
01:12:08.644 --> 01:12:09.927
Stay where you are.

1112
01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:14.682
- Strike three.
- Number Five, stay where you are.


1113
01:12:16.808 --> 01:12:19.894
Number one,
you're out of there.


1114
01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:24.649
Number Five, stay
where you are.


1115
01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:26.943
Oh, my gosh.

1116
01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:33.366
Tools.

1117
01:12:33.575 --> 01:12:34.700
Hammer! Axe!

1118
01:12:36.368 --> 01:12:37.317
Rope!

1119
01:12:37.369 --> 01:12:40.247
Three quarter inch double-braid.
Perfecto!


1120
01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:44.126
"Escaped Robot Fights for
His Life. Film at Eleven."


1121
01:12:44.178 --> 01:12:45.627
Target in sight. Fire!

1122
01:12:49.339 --> 01:12:52.091
Capture and hold.
Elevation sixteen degrees.


1123
01:12:52.842 --> 01:12:56.887
Visibility five feet,
two feet, no feet.


1124
01:12:56.939 --> 01:13:00.933
Hey, laser lips! Your mama
was a snowblower.


1125
01:13:17.908 --> 01:13:20.702
That wraps you up,
you rascally robot.


1126
01:13:23.747 --> 01:13:27.292
Target located. Elevation
sixteen degrees. Fire!


1127
01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:29.335
Holy moley!

1128
01:13:33.589 --> 01:13:36.008
- Elevation 22 degrees.
- Dumbo!


1129
01:13:36.467 --> 01:13:37.843
Axis lost. Seventeen...

1130
01:13:43.766 --> 01:13:44.923
Temper, temper!

1131
01:13:44.975 --> 01:13:46.351
Three degrees. Fire!

1132
01:13:53.274 --> 01:13:54.275
Oley!

1133
01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.114
Don't fire.
Don't light a match.


1134
01:14:00.323 --> 01:14:03.493
Well, when you gotta go
don't squeeze the charming.


1135
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:28.081
Oh, no.
Nova!


1136
01:14:28.133 --> 01:14:29.298
Let me tell you something.

1137
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:31.509
I don't like these Nova guys
anymore than you do.


1138
01:14:31.561 --> 01:14:33.938
In fact, I don't care if they
ever get Number Five back...


1139
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.096
but I want to see it.

1140
01:14:35.148 --> 01:14:38.276
If I show where he is,
do I have your word...


1141
01:14:38.328 --> 01:14:40.012
you will not experiment on him?

1142
01:14:40.064 --> 01:14:41.838
You will not flip his switches?

1143
01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:43.502
And you will not take him apart?

1144
01:14:43.554 --> 01:14:45.115
Absolutely.
You have my word.


1145
01:14:47.242 --> 01:14:48.952
He's out back.
I'll take you to him.


1146
01:14:48.953 --> 01:14:50.930
If you are ready, young lady,
you can take me, too.


1147
01:14:50.964 --> 01:14:51.778
Schroeder!

1148
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:53.540
Terrific job, Crosby.
Thanks for the help.


1149
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:55.158
- No, I had nothing...
- You bastard!


1150
01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:56.626
- I'm not...
- You're liar.


1151
01:14:56.678 --> 01:14:57.627
No I didn't know...

1152
01:15:00.337 --> 01:15:02.006
Stephanie, a trap!

1153
01:15:02.089 --> 01:15:03.757
Nova! Depart!

1154
01:15:04.341 --> 01:15:05.468
<i>Look out!</i>

1155
01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:18.438
Here's your table sir.

1156
01:15:18.772 --> 01:15:21.691
- You little bastard!
- Paco, please. No autographs, sir.


1157
01:15:23.109 --> 01:15:25.695
Come Stephanie.
We be German.


1158
01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:30.366
Bastard!

1159
01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.153
Stop!

1160
01:15:36.205 --> 01:15:38.165
- Stop!
- Go, go, go, go!


1161
01:15:47.508 --> 01:15:51.095
Great idea. Newton Crosby,
Ph. Dork.


1162
01:15:58.434 --> 01:16:00.812
- What are you doing?
- Keep driving.


1163
01:16:12.656 --> 01:16:15.283
- Step on it!
- Okay, hold on.


1164
01:16:24.876 --> 01:16:27.546
I have had it!
I have had it!


1165
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:31.423
- This was a precision operation.
- Schroeder, you set me up!


1166
01:16:31.475 --> 01:16:33.384
Crosby, I'm telling you
right now...


1167
01:16:33.759 --> 01:16:37.263
this little fart of a robot is
beginning to give me red ass.


1168
01:16:38.514 --> 01:16:40.672
Where the hell
are those other robots?


1169
01:16:40.724 --> 01:16:43.602
They should have cut
Number Five to pieces by now.


1170
01:16:48.064 --> 01:16:50.150
- Where are you guys going?
- Who's asking?


1171
01:16:50.202 --> 01:16:52.157
A wise guy.

1172
01:16:52.209 --> 01:16:54.112
Excuse this.

1173
01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.697
And this.

1174
01:16:59.784 --> 01:17:01.619
<i>Hey, Cut it out!</i>

1175
01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:08.709
<i>Numskulls.</i>

1176
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.894
Cars. Dumb machines.

1177
01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:30.021
That creep.

1178
01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.857
I should have known. Every time
I think a guy's gonna be okay...


1179
01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:34.390
turns out to be a real jerk.

1180
01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:35.985
They are all alike!
All of them!


1181
01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.528
Stephanie...

1182
01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:39.973
Well, the next time they mess
with us, we're gonna kick ass.


1183
01:17:40.047 --> 01:17:42.574
Kick ass?
Donkey, mule, burro...


1184
01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:45.076
One of them comes near you,
you blast them!


1185
01:17:45.368 --> 01:17:47.078
Just burn his butt
with your laser.


1186
01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:48.497
- Burn?
- Yeah!


1187
01:17:49.748 --> 01:17:52.793
No!
No disassemble.


1188
01:17:53.418 --> 01:17:56.338
Number Five, come on,
they deserve it.


1189
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:57.881
Stephanie.

1190
01:17:59.132 --> 01:18:00.883
Jesus, I'm sorry.

1191
01:18:01.092 --> 01:18:02.051
I just...

1192
01:18:03.344 --> 01:18:06.097
I don't know what
to do anymore.


1193
01:18:07.098 --> 01:18:08.849
Take heart little lady.

1194
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.268
I'll fix their wagon.

1195
01:18:32.497 --> 01:18:36.417
Well, the cat is dragged in a sight
for four eyes that is for sure.


1196
01:18:36.469 --> 01:18:37.991
You look dreadful.

1197
01:18:38.043 --> 01:18:39.461
What happened?
Where is Number five?


1198
01:18:39.628 --> 01:18:42.381
I saw something incredible.
I saw three robots...


1199
01:18:42.433 --> 01:18:43.955
totally re-programmed in
ten minutes.


1200
01:18:44.007 --> 01:18:46.343
I saw Number Five crash
trough a wall, grab the girl...


1201
01:18:46.344 --> 01:18:47.608
I think he was rescuing her...

1202
01:18:47.609 --> 01:18:49.542
crash trough another wall
and drive away.


1203
01:18:49.596 --> 01:18:52.005
- It was screaming her name.
- Now, wait a minute.


1204
01:18:52.057 --> 01:18:54.412
If you're thinking what I'm
thinking you're thinking...


1205
01:18:54.464 --> 01:18:57.076
then you are thinking that
female chick is some sort of...


1206
01:18:57.128 --> 01:18:59.589
- super hacker or something.
- Sure. She's a super hacker.


1207
01:18:59.590 --> 01:19:01.057
First, she cracks
the Nova access code...


1208
01:19:01.058 --> 01:19:02.321
then, she deciphers
for the language...


1209
01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:04.657
I invented, all
while we were sitting in the bar.


1210
01:19:05.611 --> 01:19:08.134
- Which was great.
- Really? Tell me. What happened?


1211
01:19:08.186 --> 01:19:10.658
We were interfacing, operating
on the same wavelength...


1212
01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:11.826
Very good, my advice helped, then.

1213
01:19:13.285 --> 01:19:15.370
What happened, did she stick
her tongue down your throat?


1214
01:19:15.412 --> 01:19:16.194
No, no.

1215
01:19:16.246 --> 01:19:18.373
Come on, sit in the van and tell me.
I want to know, yes sir.


1216
01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:19.416
Yes! Come on, Newton.

1217
01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:20.490
Oh, my goodness.

1218
01:19:20.542 --> 01:19:23.754
I am sporting
a tremendous woody right now.


1219
01:19:23.806 --> 01:19:25.005
Come on, tell me Newton.

1220
01:19:26.673 --> 01:19:28.717
Our hands came really
close to touching.


1221
01:19:28.769 --> 01:19:30.760
And she said I had really
nice eyes.


1222
01:19:30.761 --> 01:19:32.062
Yeah, you have really brown eyes.

1223
01:19:32.063 --> 01:19:35.133
And then Schroeder came in with
his Gestapo and ruined it all.


1224
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:37.375
Those bunch of
male-type organs.


1225
01:19:37.427 --> 01:19:39.602
- Right.
- That's what I'm meaning.


1226
01:19:40.394 --> 01:19:41.385
That's the RF receiver.

1227
01:19:41.437 --> 01:19:43.460
It's still tuned to Number Five's
wavelength, right?


1228
01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.483
Yes, but only if it is less than
twenty feet away.


1229
01:19:47.943 --> 01:19:50.403
Hello, bozos.

1230
01:19:51.529 --> 01:19:57.202
<i>Guys, it's Howard. If you don't
return my van in 15 minutes...</i>


1231
01:19:59.204 --> 01:20:02.248
Benjamin Jhabutiyah,
delete.


1232
01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.292
No, wait!
Rethink yourself.


1233
01:20:04.344 --> 01:20:06.336
Exit, depart, leave.

1234
01:20:07.127 --> 01:20:08.629
Hear my dust, Newton Crosby!

1235
01:20:08.681 --> 01:20:09.671
Let us break wind!

1236
01:20:11.965 --> 01:20:15.094
Newton Crosby,
no run, no talk.


1237
01:20:15.594 --> 01:20:17.054
Drive.

1238
01:20:19.139 --> 01:20:21.308
Today, Crosby, today!

1239
01:20:38.866 --> 01:20:40.326
Number Five?

1240
01:20:42.328 --> 01:20:44.329
Number Five,
where are you?


1241
01:20:56.883 --> 01:20:58.343
All right dipshit...

1242
01:20:58.718 --> 01:21:00.627
where's Number Five?
What did you do to him?


1243
01:21:00.679 --> 01:21:02.763
- You gotta control yourself just a tad.
- Hello.


1244
01:21:03.889 --> 01:21:05.089
Hi.

1245
01:21:05.141 --> 01:21:07.101
You kidnapped him?

1246
01:21:07.143 --> 01:21:09.854
Kidnapped,
shanghaied, hijacked.


1247
01:21:09.906 --> 01:21:11.772
Outstanding!

1248
01:21:11.856 --> 01:21:14.108
Communicate!
Need input!


1249
01:21:14.358 --> 01:21:16.860
I have questions,
queries, posers.


1250
01:21:16.912 --> 01:21:19.310
- You and me, both.
- Well, good.


1251
01:21:19.362 --> 01:21:23.116
You go up there, sit down,
look at the stars...


1252
01:21:23.533 --> 01:21:26.703
talk to each other,
get to know each other...


1253
01:21:26.755 --> 01:21:28.538
- man to man.
- Yes.


1254
01:21:28.788 --> 01:21:31.666
Beautiful stars.
Better see.


1255
01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:35.086
Beautiful stars.
Better see?


1256
01:21:35.128 --> 01:21:36.077
Oh, my God.

1257
01:21:36.129 --> 01:21:38.787
Are all geniuses as
stupid as you?


1258
01:21:38.839 --> 01:21:41.320
He means it's a beautiful
view of the stars.


1259
01:21:41.372 --> 01:21:43.802
I think he speaks very well
for a four day old.


1260
01:21:46.472 --> 01:21:49.808
Come. Come.
Input! Input!


1261
01:21:52.019 --> 01:21:53.770
Beautiful.

1262
01:21:53.822 --> 01:21:55.470
Right.

1263
01:21:55.521 --> 01:21:56.939
One more time,
from the top.


1264
01:21:57.690 --> 01:21:59.025
Who is your programmer?

1265
01:22:00.026 --> 01:22:01.778
Me.

1266
01:22:05.698 --> 01:22:08.451
You rewired
all your switches.


1267
01:22:08.951 --> 01:22:11.079
No wonder
you're malfunctioning.


1268
01:22:13.247 --> 01:22:17.959
Switches are my switches.
Life not malfunction.


1269
01:22:18.011 --> 01:22:20.962
Not malfunction.
I am alive.


1270
01:22:21.463 --> 01:22:24.539
No, you're not!
You can't be.


1271
01:22:24.591 --> 01:22:26.426
There's gotta be another
explanation.


1272
01:22:26.478 --> 01:22:28.386
Okay! What?

1273
01:22:32.264 --> 01:22:33.547
Sorry, time's up.

1274
01:22:33.599 --> 01:22:35.810
Wait a minute,
I'm thinking.


1275
01:22:41.315 --> 01:22:44.026
Could be any number
of mechanical possibilities.


1276
01:22:44.078 --> 01:22:46.237
Entrance of moisture
into the system.


1277
01:22:46.289 --> 01:22:48.265
- Heat expansion.
- Try again.


1278
01:22:48.317 --> 01:22:50.240
- Vibration damage.
- No way Jose.


1279
01:22:50.448 --> 01:22:52.450
- I'm fit as a fiddle.
- Okay.


1280
01:22:53.201 --> 01:22:55.537
Then why did you
ignore your programming?


1281
01:22:56.329 --> 01:22:58.706
Programming says "Destroy".

1282
01:22:58.758 --> 01:23:01.084
Is disassemble.
Make dead.


1283
01:23:01.918 --> 01:23:03.336
Number Five cannot.

1284
01:23:03.388 --> 01:23:04.379
Why?

1285
01:23:05.755 --> 01:23:07.705
Why cannot?

1286
01:23:07.757 --> 01:23:10.008
Is wrong. Incorrect.

1287
01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:14.252
Newton Crosby, PhD,
not know this?


1288
01:23:14.304 --> 01:23:18.267
Well, of course I know it's wrong
to kill, but who told you?


1289
01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.854
I told me.

1290
01:23:26.524 --> 01:23:30.142
<i>Pattycake, pattycake,
baker's man</i>


1291
01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:33.896
<i>Bake me a cake
as fast as you can...</i>


1292
01:23:33.948 --> 01:23:36.951
Here, I brought you some soup.
It's getting cold.


1293
01:23:37.003 --> 01:23:38.911
- Thank you.
- Convinced yet?


1294
01:23:41.831 --> 01:23:43.624
Well, I got one.

1295
01:23:49.254 --> 01:23:51.882
<i>There we go.
Pattycake, Pattycake...</i>


1296
01:23:52.674 --> 01:23:55.594
Number Five,
what do you make of this?


1297
01:23:57.262 --> 01:23:58.722
Wood pulp?

1298
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:01.099
Plant, vegetable,
tomato.


1299
01:24:01.349 --> 01:24:03.893
Water, salt,
monosodium glutamate.


1300
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:06.729
Okay. Thank you.

1301
01:24:07.354 --> 01:24:09.273
Now you're talking
like a robot.


1302
01:24:09.899 --> 01:24:12.860
And resemble,
look like...


1303
01:24:14.904 --> 01:24:16.697
butterfly.

1304
01:24:16.749 --> 01:24:18.282
Bird.

1305
01:24:18.574 --> 01:24:20.784
- Maple leaf.
- Where?


1306
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.206
Holy shit!

1307
01:24:26.456 --> 01:24:29.626
No shit.
Where see shit?


1308
01:24:32.462 --> 01:24:35.924
Ok, here's your oscillating
circuit. That's done right.


1309
01:24:35.976 --> 01:24:37.206
And here's...

1310
01:24:37.258 --> 01:24:38.675
Now, why'd you do this?

1311
01:24:38.717 --> 01:24:39.958
Why'd you do this?

1312
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:44.014
You shouldn't even
be operating if this goes into...


1313
01:24:44.066 --> 01:24:45.516
Let me get my other one.

1314
01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:21.633
I got it!

1315
01:25:24.094 --> 01:25:25.085
I got it!

1316
01:25:25.137 --> 01:25:26.763
All right, this is it!

1317
01:25:27.597 --> 01:25:28.630
Now, listen close.

1318
01:25:28.682 --> 01:25:30.465
There's a priest, a minister
and a rabbi.


1319
01:25:30.517 --> 01:25:33.144
They're out playing golf and
they're trying to decide...


1320
01:25:33.145 --> 01:25:34.335
how much to give to charity.

1321
01:25:34.345 --> 01:25:36.437
So the priest says, we'll
draw a circle on the ground...


1322
01:25:36.439 --> 01:25:38.399
we'll throw the money way up
in the air and whatever lands...


1323
01:25:38.451 --> 01:25:39.900
inside the circle,
we give to charity.


1324
01:25:39.942 --> 01:25:41.850
The minister says "no", we'll
draw a circle on the ground,


1325
01:25:41.902 --> 01:25:44.613
we'll throw the money way up in the air
and whatever lands outside the circle...


1326
01:25:44.665 --> 01:25:46.899
that's what we give to charity.
The rabbi says "no, no, no"...


1327
01:25:46.907 --> 01:25:48.617
we'll throw the money way
up in the air...


1328
01:25:48.784 --> 01:25:50.828
and whatever God wants, He keeps.

1329
01:25:57.751 --> 01:26:01.504
Oh! I get it.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho...

1330
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:17.853
What's the matter?

1331
01:26:20.355 --> 01:26:22.357
- Is he laughing?
- Yeah.


1332
01:26:24.526 --> 01:26:26.393
And the joke wasn't
even that funny.


1333
01:26:26.445 --> 01:26:28.112
And I figured I screwed up
the punch line.


1334
01:26:28.488 --> 01:26:30.823
Whatever God wants
He keeps.


1335
01:26:31.324 --> 01:26:32.950
Well, you look kinda
shook up.


1336
01:26:33.002 --> 01:26:34.702
Yeah, it's really true.

1337
01:26:35.953 --> 01:26:38.456
Spontaneous emotional
response.


1338
01:26:38.498 --> 01:26:39.957
I am alive. Yes?

1339
01:26:40.625 --> 01:26:42.627
Yeah, yeah, yes you are.
Yes! Yes!


1340
01:26:49.299 --> 01:26:50.248
Hey!

1341
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.219
I hope you bought enough
for everybody.


1342
01:26:52.844 --> 01:26:54.346
Give me one, too, Steph.

1343
01:26:55.889 --> 01:26:57.974
Oh, right on the sensor.

1344
01:27:03.646 --> 01:27:05.731
Danger! Nova!

1345
01:27:10.569 --> 01:27:11.987
All right, come on,
come down.


1346
01:27:12.988 --> 01:27:14.605
Why?
Just tell them he's alive.


1347
01:27:14.606 --> 01:27:16.224
Well, it doesn't look like
they want to hear that.


1348
01:27:16.225 --> 01:27:17.025
What? Wait a minute.

1349
01:27:17.026 --> 01:27:19.112
The plan was: We convince you,
and you convince them.


1350
01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:20.746
Damn it, Crosby,
you lied to me again.


1351
01:27:46.979 --> 01:27:48.178
Deploy!

1352
01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:50.482
Hit it, hit it, hit it!
Deploy!


1353
01:27:54.737 --> 01:27:57.114
The army!
The real army!


1354
01:27:57.281 --> 01:27:59.907
Your target is there,
gentlemen.


1355
01:28:01.117 --> 01:28:02.650
Crosby...

1356
01:28:02.702 --> 01:28:06.038
if I were you I would
come out of there.


1357
01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:07.571
Stat.

1358
01:28:07.623 --> 01:28:10.084
Jesus, these guys
are really severe!


1359
01:28:10.835 --> 01:28:13.171
Weapons. M-16 machine guns.

1360
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:16.256
- 40mm grenade launchers.
- Let me handle it.


1361
01:28:18.717 --> 01:28:20.302
Hi, Howard.

1362
01:28:20.552 --> 01:28:22.387
Schroeder. How you doin'?

1363
01:28:22.679 --> 01:28:24.546
Howard. Howard!

1364
01:28:24.598 --> 01:28:27.517
We're fine. Number Five
is right here with us.


1365
01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:30.218
I've got it completely
under my control.


1366
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:32.522
- Another lie.
- I'm lying to them, not to you.


1367
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:33.940
It's still lying.

1368
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:37.485
We're coming out now.

1369
01:28:40.529 --> 01:28:42.490
They're cooking something up.
I can smell it.


1370
01:28:42.542 --> 01:28:44.366
We gotta fire them now, Howard.

1371
01:28:45.868 --> 01:28:48.454
Don't you dare shoot
your stupid guns.


1372
01:28:48.496 --> 01:28:51.290
- Where's Number Five?
- He's fine. He's in the van.


1373
01:28:52.083 --> 01:28:53.374
Okay. Okay.

1374
01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:57.170
Why don't you and the young
lady just get away from the van...


1375
01:28:57.337 --> 01:28:58.838
and let us handle it?

1376
01:28:58.922 --> 01:29:01.508
Yes, Stephanie, get away.
Danger.


1377
01:29:02.008 --> 01:29:03.510
No, listen...

1378
01:29:03.885 --> 01:29:07.055
I was able to activate
the voice command module.


1379
01:29:07.107 --> 01:29:07.920
God damn it!

1380
01:29:07.972 --> 01:29:10.475
I am sick and tired of listening
to this technical bullshit.


1381
01:29:10.516 --> 01:29:13.560
Shut up, Schroeder,
I'll handle this.


1382
01:29:13.612 --> 01:29:15.396
He's stalling.

1383
01:29:17.272 --> 01:29:22.069
Crosby, we're going to have to
ask you to surrender the robot.


1384
01:29:23.695 --> 01:29:24.696
No!

1385
01:29:26.115 --> 01:29:28.699
- Stat?
- Stat!


1386
01:29:29.033 --> 01:29:32.203
- What does that mean anyway?
- I don't know.


1387
01:29:33.079 --> 01:29:34.831
But that is not the point.

1388
01:29:34.997 --> 01:29:37.500
We need that robot.

1389
01:29:37.542 --> 01:29:39.325
Howard, listen...

1390
01:29:39.377 --> 01:29:41.379
I know what
the malfunction is.


1391
01:29:42.088 --> 01:29:43.204
Sorry, Crosby...

1392
01:29:43.256 --> 01:29:45.195
we can't take any more chances.

1393
01:29:45.247 --> 01:29:47.134
We're not losing that thing again.

1394
01:29:47.467 --> 01:29:50.595
Howard, if you'd just come over
and inspect the unit...


1395
01:29:52.889 --> 01:29:54.474
You're all such
a bunch of liars!


1396
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:57.644
As soon as they're clear,
open fire!


1397
01:29:57.728 --> 01:29:58.551
What have you done?

1398
01:29:58.603 --> 01:30:00.250
- Schroeder!
- I'll take care of this.


1399
01:30:00.602 --> 01:30:02.698
No, you're not taking over.
Now listen...


1400
01:30:04.942 --> 01:30:06.694
Banzai!

1401
01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:12.283
<i>Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!</i>


1402
01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:14.410
He's alive! He's alive!

1403
01:30:17.538 --> 01:30:18.570
Call them off, Howard.

1404
01:30:18.622 --> 01:30:20.458
You're making the biggest
mistake in history!


1405
01:30:20.583 --> 01:30:22.251
He's alive! I can prove it.

1406
01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:27.756
No, look, it's okay.
He's going to make it!


1407
01:31:18.762 --> 01:31:20.222
No!

1408
01:31:34.903 --> 01:31:36.737
Number Five!

1409
01:32:00.927 --> 01:32:04.556
Oh, my God.
Get me out of here.


1410
01:32:14.857 --> 01:32:16.817
Magnificent! Magnificent!

1411
01:32:16.859 --> 01:32:19.361
Now that, my friend,
is how you kick ass!


1412
01:32:19.486 --> 01:32:22.740
Years of research are down the tube
and you're happy as a pig in slop.


1413
01:32:22.781 --> 01:32:24.825
Just doing my job, sir.

1414
01:32:25.868 --> 01:32:28.871
Maybe from now on you can
do it somewhere else.


1415
01:32:57.522 --> 01:32:59.149
Are you going to be okay?

1416
01:33:00.484 --> 01:33:02.360
I don't think so.

1417
01:33:02.778 --> 01:33:04.613
Not for a while.

1418
01:33:08.157 --> 01:33:10.076
I'm sorry you lost your job.

1419
01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:13.662
But I'm really glad you quit Nova.

1420
01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:17.833
- What will you do now?
- I don't know yet.


1421
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:21.587
My dad left me a few
acres up in Montana.


1422
01:33:22.254 --> 01:33:24.464
I hear it's beautiful there
this time of year.


1423
01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:26.424
Great idea!

1424
01:33:26.508 --> 01:33:29.594
I say we cruise on up there
and check it out.


1425
01:33:32.138 --> 01:33:34.224
Hi, honey! I'm home!

1426
01:33:34.724 --> 01:33:36.184
Number Five?

1427
01:33:39.062 --> 01:33:41.523
Pull over, pull over,
quick, pull over!


1428
01:33:49.947 --> 01:33:52.199
- Number Five!
- Stephanie!


1429
01:33:52.241 --> 01:33:55.119
It's so good to see you.
I thought they blew you up.


1430
01:33:55.244 --> 01:33:57.746
Counterfeit. facsimile.
Replica!


1431
01:33:59.289 --> 01:34:02.083
He made a duplicate of himself
from all these spare parts.


1432
01:34:02.135 --> 01:34:03.835
That's incredible!
This guy's a genius!


1433
01:34:03.918 --> 01:34:05.451
Above average.

1434
01:34:05.452 --> 01:34:06.695
Oh, Number Five, you are great!

1435
01:34:06.696 --> 01:34:08.907
You're outstandingly great!

1436
01:34:10.466 --> 01:34:11.718
What's our next move?

1437
01:34:11.759 --> 01:34:13.845
Come on, let's do as he says.
We'll go to Montana.


1438
01:34:13.897 --> 01:34:14.846
Ya!

1439
01:34:15.346 --> 01:34:17.724
I got forty acres up there.
Great for him to hide out...


1440
01:34:17.776 --> 01:34:19.130
Soak up input.

1441
01:34:19.182 --> 01:34:21.518
I don't know. I have
responsibilities here.


1442
01:34:21.570 --> 01:34:23.854
- What about my animals?
- Come on, Stephanie.


1443
01:34:23.906 --> 01:34:26.273
Wait a minute.
Did you say forty acres?


1444
01:34:26.773 --> 01:34:29.067
Listen, do you like animals?

1445
01:34:29.985 --> 01:34:31.987
Yeah. How many animals
are we talking about?


1446
01:34:32.039 --> 01:34:34.865
Great. I drive, you two
work this out.


1447
01:34:48.335 --> 01:34:50.953
Number five stupid name.

1448
01:34:51.005 --> 01:34:55.175
- Want to be Kevin or Dave.
- Just watch the road, okay?


1449
01:34:55.633 --> 01:34:57.802
Maybe Johnny. Yeah.

1450
01:34:58.261 --> 01:35:00.930
Johnny Five. That's cool.

1451
01:35:03.933 --> 01:35:05.226
Gimme five.
