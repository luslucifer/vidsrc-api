00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:46.392
<i>This is Report 105 from Xeno
Archaeological Expedition, Team Seven.</i>


2
00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:49.603
<i>Documentation Officer
Kate Carson reporting.</i>


3
00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:52.901
<i>The past two months of
survey and research</i>


4
00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:57.448
<i>have resulted in the discovery
of a vast, tomb-like complex.</i>


5
00:01:57.538 --> 00:01:59.951
<i>This structure was
unmentioned in any report</i>


6
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.784
<i>made by the previous and
abandoned expedition to this planet.</i>


7
00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:06.540
<i>Entry to the tomb has now been made,</i>

8
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.338
<i>and examination of the
inner chambers may reveal</i>


9
00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:11.541
<i>vital information about the extinction</i>

10
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:14.503
<i>of the previous race
that inhabited this planet.</i>


11
00:02:16.932 --> 00:02:19.049
<i>Despite the planet's two suns,</i>

12
00:02:19.142 --> 00:02:23.432
<i>the surface temperature remains
a constant 89 degrees below zero.</i>


13
00:02:23.522 --> 00:02:26.811
<i>However, life-support systems
and electrical installations</i>


14
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.768
<i>in the underground headquarters
are fully operational.</i>


15
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:32.319
<i>Safety factor: 60 per cent.</i>

16
00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:33.942
<i>Conditions:</i>

17
00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:35.489
<i>tolerable.</i>

18
00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:11.002
Wait a minute.
Will you take a look at that?


19
00:04:11.922 --> 00:04:15.006
Dean, shine your torch
over here for a minute.


20
00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:18.335
This is terrific.

21
00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:25.391
Looks like there's another
section through here.


22
00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.226
Listen, Dean,
don't wander off too far.


23
00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:32.502
No, don't worry, I won't.

24
00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:36.440
<i>- I wanna be able to hear you at all times.</i>
- Yeah, I'll keep in touch.


25
00:05:04.182 --> 00:05:08.597
- Hey, this looks interesting.
<i>- Dean, what have you found?</i>


26
00:05:08.687 --> 00:05:11.475
<i>- Dean?</i>
- Some kind of wall carving.


27
00:05:11.606 --> 00:05:13.347
<i>Can you read it?
Can you make it out?</i>


28
00:05:13.442 --> 00:05:14.978
Means nothing to me.

29
00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:16.855
<i>Can you recognise
anything on it at all?</i>


30
00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:20.404
No. We'll have to get Mitch
to figure this one out.


31
00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:28.370
Well, listen, don't...

32
00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:30.369
<i>don't stay there too long.</i>

33
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.958
<i>Come back, and we'll have it
checked later. Come back now.</i>


34
00:05:33.044 --> 00:05:36.253
- There's something here...
<i>- Dean!</i>


35
00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:37.955
Ricky?

36
00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:44.171
<i>Dean, can you hear me?</i>

37
00:05:45.348 --> 00:05:47.465
<i>Dean, what have you found?</i>

38
00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:51.602
Ricky?

39
00:05:52.022 --> 00:05:53.183
<i>Ricky, can you hear me?</i>

40
00:05:53.482 --> 00:05:55.849
<i>- Yeah, what's the matter?</i>
- Ricky...


41
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.587
Move it!

42
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:30.053
- Hang on.
- How long have we got?


43
00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:31.975
I don't know.

44
00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:36.938
Can you hear me, Ricky?

45
00:06:37.025 --> 00:06:38.561
Can you hear me, Ricky?

46
00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:41.440
- I'll take him. Come on.
- Sandy, get his legs up.


47
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.398
- Okay, get him up. Come on.
- Come on, Sandy, let's go.


48
00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:47.359
Easy.
Okay, Sharon, come on, move it.


49
00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:49.277
What happened?

50
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:51.283
What about Dean?

51
00:06:52.374 --> 00:06:54.582
- I don't know.
- Is there much damage?


52
00:06:55.377 --> 00:06:56.993
One sector's knocked out out there.

53
00:06:57.087 --> 00:06:59.607
Okay, you'd better get back there, too,
and see what you can do.


54
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.089
The voice communicators
don't work in there.


55
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.969
Gary, this is Holly. Respond.

56
00:07:08.557 --> 00:07:10.890
<i>Gary, will you answer me?</i>

57
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.560
Yes, what is it?

58
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:14.348
Did you check the
communicators in the suits


59
00:07:14.437 --> 00:07:15.518
like you were supposed to?

60
00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:16.438
I did.

61
00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:18.351
<i>Well, we've had a
problem with the tomb,</i>


62
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.977
<i>and the communicators are all dead.</i>

63
00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:21.934
It sounds to me like
a frequency block.


64
00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:23.394
Damn it, that can't be right.

65
00:07:23.488 --> 00:07:25.275
Get your ass up here on the double.

66
00:07:25.365 --> 00:07:27.823
<i>I want to know why we have
this communications problem.</i>


67
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:29.866
"Get your ass up here on the double."

68
00:07:29.953 --> 00:07:32.115
I know what I'd like
to do with her arse.


69
00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:40.120
22...

70
00:07:40.213 --> 00:07:42.455
- How is he?
- 31...


71
00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:46.505
40.
Okay, let's get his suit off, please.


72
00:07:47.512 --> 00:07:49.469
How is he?

73
00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:53.390
- What's that in his hand?
- No, don't.


74
00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:56.093
- Get me an isolation unit. Come on.
- What is it?


75
00:07:56.187 --> 00:07:59.271
Holly, give me half an hour,
then you can talk to him.


76
00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:00.723
Okay.

77
00:08:04.446 --> 00:08:07.564
I want to know what kind
of crystals these are.


78
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.369
- I'll run some tests.
- Okay.


79
00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:20.894
This is Xeno Sub-satellite
Research Team Seven,


80
00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:25.646
Archaeology Team Documentation Officer
conducting Interview... 273


81
00:09:25.735 --> 00:09:27.692
with Commander Holly McKay.

82
00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:31.193
Holly, what can you disclose
about this accident?


83
00:09:31.908 --> 00:09:34.366
We have no idea
what caused the explosion.


84
00:09:34.452 --> 00:09:36.535
Our photographer,
Ricky Williams, was there,


85
00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:39.159
and narrowly escaped serious injury.

86
00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:40.706
Dean White has yet to be located.

87
00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:44.411
- But does this mean we have to extend?
- There's no way we can extend.


88
00:09:44.504 --> 00:09:46.864
If we miss the pick-up,
there's no telling how long it'll be


89
00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:48.710
before Xeno can slot us in again.

90
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.736
- That's all I can say for the moment.
- Well, thank you.


91
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.628
<i>Holly? We've got Dean.</i>

92
00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:14.236
Is he dead?

93
00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:16.442
Technically, he's still alive.

94
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:24.958
Anything you can do?

95
00:10:25.045 --> 00:10:27.002
I've done everything I can.

96
00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:31.124
I'll just keep him alive
until we get him back.


97
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:39.719
Holly, we must get back
into that tomb.


98
00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:41.220
That may prove unfeasible.

99
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:43.769
Mitch has a theory that
the planet was ruled by twins.


100
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.562
That's right.

101
00:10:45.648 --> 00:10:49.232
The inscriptions indicate a very
interesting belief in mythology.


102
00:10:49.319 --> 00:10:51.811
Now, everything seemed
to happen in pairs.


103
00:10:51.905 --> 00:10:53.646
I've never come across
anything like it.


104
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.427
The planet has two suns. Maybe
that's the reason for the duplication?


105
00:10:56.451 --> 00:11:00.365
You know, the creation of
the previous race fascinates me.


106
00:11:00.455 --> 00:11:03.948
There seems to be
a chemical intelligence present.


107
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:06.538
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


108
00:11:06.628 --> 00:11:08.961
I want to know what
caused that explosion first.


109
00:11:09.047 --> 00:11:12.256
Look, we're not gonna change our
departure time, but Mitch is right.


110
00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:15.301
I mean, this obviously
needs to be investigated.


111
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.383
Sharon, do you have any more
information about those crystals?


112
00:11:18.473 --> 00:11:20.556
Well, I've only just
started the tests,


113
00:11:20.683 --> 00:11:24.643
but there seems to be some sort of...
energy force surrounding the crystals.


114
00:11:24.729 --> 00:11:29.315
Look, this team isn't prepared for
the contingencies we're facing now.


115
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.440
If it was up to me,
I'd say abandon and get taking off.


116
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:37.190
But it could be years before anybody
was sent back here. Perhaps never.


117
00:11:37.283 --> 00:11:38.819
All our work would be wasted.

118
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.867
Listen, I'm not feeling too hot.

119
00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:43.411
I think I'd better get some rest.

120
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.702
Take care of yourself, Rick.

121
00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:49.289
There's still the question of
what caused the explosion.


122
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.254
I think we'll leave it for
someone else to find out.


123
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.674
Unknown energy fields are
beyond the range of this team.


124
00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.844
Barbra, let's tell Xeno
to take us off, please.


125
00:11:58.972 --> 00:12:00.929
Can't for 72 hours. 
They're in orbit.

126
00:12:01.057 --> 00:12:03.219
Well, as soon as you can, then.
In the meantime,


127
00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:04.971
I don't want anyone
going near that site


128
00:12:05.061 --> 00:12:06.393
without my direct permission.

129
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.277
- Mm-hmm?
<i>- Gail here.</i>


130
00:12:16.364 --> 00:12:17.445
<i>Sorry to bother you, Mark,</i>

131
00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:20.696
<i>but I'm getting an electrical
disturbance coming from the lab.</i>


132
00:12:20.785 --> 00:12:23.368
- Right, I'll hurry down there and check it.
<i>- Okay.</i>


133
00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:25.405
- Gail?
<i>- Yes?</i>


134
00:12:25.498 --> 00:12:27.285
Would you do me a favour?

135
00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:29.492
Er... would you ask Sandy
to meet me down there?


136
00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:32.374
<i>- Yes, okay.</i>
- Okay, thanks a lot.


137
00:13:03.578 --> 00:13:05.069
Hello.

138
00:13:07.415 --> 00:13:08.997
I love you.

139
00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:11.575
Mmm. I love you, too.

140
00:13:20.345 --> 00:13:22.177
What's the matter with the lights?

141
00:13:22.263 --> 00:13:25.677
I don't know,
but I think it's kinda great.


142
00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:09.675
Erm...

143
00:14:10.812 --> 00:14:15.352
What exactly have you discovered
from the inscriptions inside the tomb?


144
00:14:17.568 --> 00:14:19.560
I found some very disturbing elements

145
00:14:19.654 --> 00:14:22.317
which, at the moment,
I don't fully understand.


146
00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:27.698
Now, the previous inhabitants were
obviously highly intelligent,


147
00:14:27.787 --> 00:14:30.746
but there seems to be
a form of, er... self-destruction...


148
00:14:30.832 --> 00:14:33.040
Mitch, sorry. Er, Kate...

149
00:14:33.126 --> 00:14:35.083
Holly wants to have
some photographic evidence


150
00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:37.456
of the damage caused
by the explosion.


151
00:14:37.547 --> 00:14:39.504
Well, what's that got to do with me?

152
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.957
You and I have
been assigned to do it.

153
00:14:43.136 --> 00:14:45.844
Yesterday, Holly said she didn't
want anyone to go out there.


154
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.344
Yep, that's more like it.
We <i>should</i> get some evidence.


155
00:14:49.434 --> 00:14:51.767
Do you want to take
some photographs, honey?


156
00:14:53.604 --> 00:14:55.596
Oh, I don't know.
I'll be glad when we go home.


157
00:14:55.857 --> 00:14:58.019
Yes, I know what you mean.

158
00:14:59.861 --> 00:15:01.443
Hey, Ricky.

159
00:15:02.196 --> 00:15:03.916
Well, what's wrong?
Hey, what are you doing?


160
00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:06.115
- I've got to find Dean!
- Ricky, come here.


161
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.567
- What's up with you?
- Get out of my way!


162
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:10.948
Ricky, it's all right. 
It's all right.

163
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.664
Listen, Ricky.
Listen to me, Dean's not in there.


164
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:17.869
Let go. Let go!

165
00:15:19.172 --> 00:15:21.835
No!

166
00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:24.542
Stop it!

167
00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:38.771
See to him.

168
00:15:39.567 --> 00:15:41.559
<i>Ricky!</i>

169
00:15:43.196 --> 00:15:44.812
<i>Ricky!</i>

170
00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:47.822
Hey, Ricky.

171
00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:57.408
- Are you okay?
- No, no, no, let's go.


172
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.927
What's down there?

173
00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:12.385
- Where does it lead to?
- I don't know but I'm gonna find out.


174
00:16:12.475 --> 00:16:14.558
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.


175
00:16:14.644 --> 00:16:15.930
- Where does it go?
- The track.


176
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.500
- I'll check the other route.
- We'll get back to the monitors.


177
00:16:57.061 --> 00:16:59.053
Get to Operations, Barbra.

178
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:55.613
Oh, no!

179
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:05.285
He's left that outer door open.

180
00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:07.666
Well, he can't stay
out there for long.


181
00:18:08.883 --> 00:18:10.920
Gary, do you see him?

182
00:18:11.052 --> 00:18:13.009
Yes, I can.

183
00:18:14.305 --> 00:18:16.592
He's just wandering around,

184
00:18:17.141 --> 00:18:19.929
as if he's lost his
sense of direction.


185
00:18:24.732 --> 00:18:26.189
I've lost him, Holly.

186
00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:34.917
Ricky?

187
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:46.307
Gail!

188
00:19:46.397 --> 00:19:47.478
<i>Get over here, quickly!</i>

189
00:19:48.024 --> 00:19:49.811
<i>I... can't.</i>

190
00:19:51.944 --> 00:19:54.527
I can't, Holly, my foot's stuck.

191
00:19:55.823 --> 00:19:58.691
<i>Gary, any way to override the lock
on this door?</i>


192
00:19:58.784 --> 00:20:01.868
I'm not sure. I'll get Barbra
to check the main computer.


193
00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:08.959
If Gary can get that inner door open,
you could get out there, right?


194
00:20:09.045 --> 00:20:12.083
- That's right.
- Okay. Get this off.


195
00:20:12.673 --> 00:20:15.791
- How long have we got?
- Only two or three minutes, maybe.


196
00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:19.925
- Let's do it slow. Come on. That's it.
- There must be a way of overriding that lock.


197
00:20:20.389 --> 00:20:22.756
<i>Gail, you must get here quickly.</i>

198
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.887
<i>We need to close the airlock.</i>

199
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.687
My thermal unit's gone.

200
00:20:33.527 --> 00:20:37.146
<i>Okay, Gail? Gail.</i>

201
00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:40.107
This is Gary. Now, listen to me.

202
00:20:40.743 --> 00:20:43.952
<i>You must connect
the blue and yellow leads.</i>


203
00:20:44.038 --> 00:20:48.248
Repeat, connect the
blue and yellow leads.


204
00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:50.579
<i>That will bypass the thermostat.</i>

205
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.286
<i>We can't get to you, Gail.</i>

206
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.246
You have to do it yourself.

207
00:20:57.051 --> 00:20:58.758
Come on, Gail.

208
00:20:58.844 --> 00:21:00.301
<i>Oh, Gary...</i>

209
00:21:02.306 --> 00:21:05.344
I can't do it.
You've got to help me.


210
00:21:05.434 --> 00:21:09.053
I can't help you, Gail.
You've got to help yourself.


211
00:21:09.146 --> 00:21:11.354
The blue and yellow leads.

212
00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:15.392
Oh, Christ, I'm freezing.

213
00:21:15.486 --> 00:21:17.214
<i>Gary, her body temperature's dropped.</i>

214
00:21:17.238 --> 00:21:18.900
<i>Connect the leads, Gail!</i>

215
00:21:18.989 --> 00:21:21.356
<i>- Bloody gloves!</i>
- Down to 36.5.


216
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.692
<i>Gary, I can't do it!</i>

217
00:21:23.786 --> 00:21:25.903
<i>"Can't" is a word
I don't understand.</i>


218
00:21:25.996 --> 00:21:27.828
<i>Now do it, Gail!</i>

219
00:21:27.957 --> 00:21:29.243
You can't give up now.

220
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:31.370
- 36.2.
<i>- Oh, Gary,</i>


221
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.543
I'm gonna die out here.

222
00:21:33.963 --> 00:21:36.900
- She'll go into hypothermia at this rate.
- I can't help you, sweetheart.


223
00:21:36.924 --> 00:21:39.291
- It's up to you.
<i>- Help me, Gary.</i>


224
00:21:40.803 --> 00:21:43.011
<i>35.6.</i>

225
00:21:44.598 --> 00:21:45.884
<i>35.5.</i>

226
00:21:45.975 --> 00:21:48.592
<i>You must do it, Gail. Connect</i>

227
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:51.679
the wires.
The blue and the yellow.


228
00:21:51.772 --> 00:21:53.559
<i>Gail! Listen to me!</i>

229
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:56.228
<i>She'll go unconscious any minute.</i>

230
00:21:56.777 --> 00:21:58.188
Gail!

231
00:22:02.199 --> 00:22:04.156
<i>No, Gail. Gail!</i>

232
00:22:04.243 --> 00:22:06.155
<i>Reconnect the life-support!</i>

233
00:22:06.245 --> 00:22:08.077
Reconnect the life-support!

234
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.413
- 34.8.
- Gail!


235
00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:13.666
This is Gary. Listen to me, Gail.

236
00:22:14.795 --> 00:22:16.127
34.7.

237
00:22:22.219 --> 00:22:24.586
Gail. Gail!

238
00:22:34.815 --> 00:22:38.354
Bypass the thermostat, woman!
Damn you, woman!


239
00:24:00.192 --> 00:24:03.230
<i>Kate, come here and shut the door.</i>

240
00:24:06.073 --> 00:24:07.735
Oh...

241
00:24:12.037 --> 00:24:14.620
<i>Kate, come over here.
That's an order!</i>


242
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:17.327
Oh...

243
00:24:33.475 --> 00:24:35.637
Ricky, out of my way.

244
00:24:38.564 --> 00:24:40.601
Ricky, get out of my way.
Ricky!


245
00:24:57.958 --> 00:25:00.120
Well, what would you have done?

246
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.248
You didn't see him
in that tomb. He was...


247
00:25:04.048 --> 00:25:06.415
Then I just...
I...


248
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.128
- I just freaked.
- Did you have to kill him?


249
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:15.891
It's very easy for you to talk here
in the operations room.


250
00:25:15.976 --> 00:25:17.512
He was out of his mind.

251
00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:18.889
That outer door was open.

252
00:25:18.979 --> 00:25:23.144
What would've happened
if he'd opened the inner one?


253
00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:27.589
Look, any of you could've
found yourself in the same situation.


254
00:25:27.613 --> 00:25:29.149
What would you have done?

255
00:25:29.239 --> 00:25:32.403
All right, Kate. All right.
Calm down.


256
00:25:41.126 --> 00:25:43.709
What do you make of Ricky's behaviour?

257
00:25:44.755 --> 00:25:47.793
Well, he was obviously exposed
to something out there.


258
00:25:47.883 --> 00:25:49.840
What it is, I've got no idea.

259
00:25:50.594 --> 00:25:53.302
There is a chance it has
something to do with the crystals.


260
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:56.723
- Ah, so a contamination problem?
- No, not necessarily.


261
00:25:56.809 --> 00:25:59.347
You see, the crystals have been
in the station about 24 hours,


262
00:25:59.436 --> 00:26:01.849
but Ricky was showing symptoms
long before that.


263
00:26:01.939 --> 00:26:05.558
No, I think whatever it is must
break the skin, as in Ricky's case,


264
00:26:05.651 --> 00:26:08.064
or at least have some form
of close physical contact.


265
00:26:08.153 --> 00:26:10.770
My tests don't show
any organic matter.


266
00:26:10.864 --> 00:26:13.277
What do you think they could contain?

267
00:26:13.367 --> 00:26:15.303
Well, we're gonna have to
get samples of that stuff,


268
00:26:15.327 --> 00:26:17.535
because people are
gonna want to look at it.


269
00:26:17.621 --> 00:26:20.785
Holly, surely there's no obligation
to continue with any of this?


270
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.827
I know, Kate, but it's my job.

271
00:26:57.494 --> 00:26:59.952
You want to be careful
with that, Mitch.


272
00:26:59.997 --> 00:27:01.078
Yeah.

273
00:27:01.915 --> 00:27:05.283
You know, there's something
about these crystals


274
00:27:05.377 --> 00:27:07.994
that we just haven't discovered yet.

275
00:27:08.672 --> 00:27:13.167
Now... their energy must have
something to do with a life source.


276
00:27:14.511 --> 00:27:17.879
Do you mean there might be
something out there feeding on them?


277
00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.170
- We'll lose audio here.
- Okay. Stay close, huh?


278
00:27:50.255 --> 00:27:52.463
Don't worry, I will.

279
00:30:16.902 --> 00:30:19.485
Sandy! Sandy!

280
00:32:49.012 --> 00:32:51.595
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

281
00:32:55.394 --> 00:32:58.558
Sh-sh-ssh. Sandy, Sandy.
Come on.


282
00:32:59.147 --> 00:33:02.857
Okay, that's enough.
Come on. She's calming down.


283
00:33:02.943 --> 00:33:04.855
What happened out there?

284
00:33:12.452 --> 00:33:13.846
We shouldn't have brought him in here.

285
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.953
- Sharon, I have to examine him.
- No!


286
00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:18.873
Give her one of your shots,
and clear her head.


287
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.992
Sandy, do you hear me?

288
00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:23.749
- She's in no condition to talk.
- I'll put her in condition.


289
00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:26.422
She needs to rest.

290
00:33:26.508 --> 00:33:29.626
Sandy, we have to
know what's out there.


291
00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:31.711
Try, Sandy.

292
00:33:31.805 --> 00:33:33.546
- Try.
- Leave her alone.


293
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.427
She can't hear you.

294
00:33:35.517 --> 00:33:38.931
Listen, Sandy's in a deep trauma.

295
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.603
No...

296
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:45.400
I think she's been
literally scared out of her senses.


297
00:33:46.153 --> 00:33:48.145
No...

298
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.392
How do you feel?

299
00:34:27.986 --> 00:34:30.444
- Thirsty.
- I'll get you a drink.


300
00:34:34.993 --> 00:34:36.985
- You got any pain?
- No.


301
00:34:39.581 --> 00:34:40.822
Thanks.

302
00:34:44.711 --> 00:34:46.919
- I feel sick.
- Hang on.


303
00:34:47.005 --> 00:34:49.338
Come on.

304
00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:02.931
Back we go.

305
00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:04.933
Get your legs up.

306
00:35:05.023 --> 00:35:08.858
- Sandy, I want you to take these.
- Oh, I couldn't.


307
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.817
- Does that arm hurt?
- Yes.


308
00:35:17.911 --> 00:35:21.575
- You gave me an injection, didn't you?
- Yes, I did, but in the other arm.


309
00:35:21.706 --> 00:35:24.744
- Let's have a look.
- Ooh.


310
00:35:31.383 --> 00:35:33.500
Come on, Sandy, come on.

311
00:35:33.593 --> 00:35:36.757
It's all right. Come on, come on,
back you come.


312
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:39.342
There we are, it's all right.

313
00:35:39.808 --> 00:35:40.808
It's all right.

314
00:35:41.101 --> 00:35:44.890
Now listen, Sandy, we're going to
give you a thorough examination, hmm?


315
00:35:52.946 --> 00:35:54.232
Holly?

316
00:35:55.615 --> 00:35:57.197
Yes, Karl?

317
00:35:57.784 --> 00:35:59.241
Problem?

318
00:35:59.327 --> 00:36:02.070
- Yes, it's Sandy.
- Oh, how is she?


319
00:36:02.163 --> 00:36:04.576
Well, she's fine as long as
I keep her sedated.


320
00:36:04.666 --> 00:36:07.579
But do you remember the marks
I found on Ricky's hand?


321
00:36:07.669 --> 00:36:09.706
- Yes?
- She has one on her arm.


322
00:36:09.796 --> 00:36:12.459
- Oh, Christ.
- Yeah, and that's not all.


323
00:36:13.174 --> 00:36:16.008
As you know, Holly, I perform
certain prescribed medical duties...


324
00:36:16.094 --> 00:36:19.337
- What are you getting at?
- Including quarterly injections to restrict...


325
00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:22.890
- Are you trying to tell me she's pregnant?
- Two months.


326
00:36:23.351 --> 00:36:26.515
That can't be.
We had our injection the same time.


327
00:37:19.616 --> 00:37:21.778
Please! No!

328
00:37:21.868 --> 00:37:24.155
No! No!

329
00:38:37.485 --> 00:38:39.192
Jesus.

330
00:38:39.738 --> 00:38:41.479
Now we'll never know what happened.

331
00:38:41.573 --> 00:38:43.815
That's the end of our project.

332
00:38:44.325 --> 00:38:46.442
All right, what's
Xeno's position, Barbra?


333
00:38:46.703 --> 00:38:50.413
We should be able to
make contact in six hours.


334
00:38:50.498 --> 00:38:52.535
Well, then all we can do is wait.

335
00:40:56.624 --> 00:40:58.160
Mm...

336
00:41:00.295 --> 00:41:02.287
Ah...

337
00:41:29.616 --> 00:41:31.528
Hi. Feeling better?

338
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:36.991
I tell you, I
can't wait to go home.

339
00:41:38.791 --> 00:41:42.375
Don't know about you
but I've had this mission.


340
00:41:43.338 --> 00:41:47.252
Don't know what's going on
but whatever it is, it's weird.


341
00:41:48.009 --> 00:41:50.342
I agree with Kate completely.

342
00:41:50.428 --> 00:41:52.670
We should abandon and go home.

343
00:41:58.144 --> 00:42:00.306
Can't wait to go home.

344
00:43:13.845 --> 00:43:15.381
Go away.

345
00:43:15.471 --> 00:43:17.463
Go away!

346
00:43:18.516 --> 00:43:21.509
I said, go away!

347
00:43:22.353 --> 00:43:24.345
Holly, go away!

348
00:43:26.315 --> 00:43:28.477
Go away!

349
00:43:32.488 --> 00:43:34.525
- Hey, there's Sandy.
- What are they up to?


350
00:43:34.615 --> 00:43:35.822
Sandy?

351
00:44:01.601 --> 00:44:03.263
Mmm...

352
00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:09.226
Ah!

353
00:44:09.317 --> 00:44:11.058
Ow.

354
00:44:11.986 --> 00:44:13.978
Ooh.

355
00:44:15.823 --> 00:44:17.780
<i>Pay attention, please.</i>

356
00:44:18.159 --> 00:44:22.199
<i>Secure all stations.
Remain just where you are.</i>


357
00:44:22.288 --> 00:44:26.202
<i>Secure all doors.
Do not admit anyone.</i>


358
00:44:26.292 --> 00:44:30.332
<i>Do not admit any personnel.</i>

359
00:44:33.174 --> 00:44:35.336
<i>- Mark?</i>
- Yeah, Holly?


360
00:44:35.426 --> 00:44:37.383
<i>- Mark?</i>
- What's going on?


361
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.462
<i>Sandy's killed Barbra.</i>

362
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:45.634
- What are you talking about?
<i>- Listen, she's killed Barbra.</i>


363
00:44:46.687 --> 00:44:49.054
- I don't understand this.
<i>- No time to explain.</i>


364
00:44:49.148 --> 00:44:51.561
<i>You gotta reach Sharon right now.</i>

365
00:44:52.527 --> 00:44:55.611
- Well, where's Sharon?
<i>- In her quarters, I hope.</i>


366
00:44:55.696 --> 00:44:57.813
<i>Mark, please be careful.</i>

367
00:45:36.028 --> 00:45:38.270
- Who is it?
<i>- It's Mark.</i>


368
00:45:38.698 --> 00:45:40.860
- What do you want?
- Open the door.


369
00:45:41.117 --> 00:45:42.574
No.

370
00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:45.736
Hey, quit screwing around, Sharon,
and open the door.


371
00:45:45.872 --> 00:45:48.615
We've all had instructions
to keep our doors locked.


372
00:45:48.708 --> 00:45:51.496
<i>Sharon, I'm ordering you
to open this door.</i>


373
00:45:51.586 --> 00:45:53.794
My instructions came from Holly.

374
00:45:53.921 --> 00:45:56.459
Well, get Holly on the
damn communicator, then!


375
00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:00.051
<i>Control?</i>

376
00:46:00.052 --> 00:46:03.671
- I've got Mark outside the door, and...
<i>- Well, open it!</i>


377
00:46:10.146 --> 00:46:14.140
Come on, Sharon.

378
00:46:15.193 --> 00:46:16.934
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Yeah. Hello?


379
00:46:17.028 --> 00:46:20.521
<i>- Mark, you with Sharon?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here, she's here.


380
00:46:20.615 --> 00:46:22.572
<i>Bring her up here now.
No, no, no...</i>


381
00:46:22.658 --> 00:46:24.570
<i>- Go to the mess hall first.</i>
- What for?


382
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.322
<i>We may need food.</i>

383
00:46:27.538 --> 00:46:29.074
Okay.

384
00:46:29.165 --> 00:46:31.157
<i>- Be careful.</i>
- Yup.


385
00:46:32.335 --> 00:46:35.624
- What's going on?
- Come on, I'll tell you later.


386
00:48:22.028 --> 00:48:23.985
Number three scanner's gone dead.

387
00:48:28.784 --> 00:48:31.026
Damn it, four's gone now.

388
00:48:31.662 --> 00:48:34.200
At least she's nowhere near those two.

389
00:48:38.002 --> 00:48:40.619
What's that?

390
00:48:40.713 --> 00:48:42.705
I don't know. Come on.

391
00:48:46.802 --> 00:48:48.668
I'll take that.

392
00:48:48.763 --> 00:48:51.221
Can't you fix it?

393
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:53.511
I'm trying, Holly, I'm trying.

394
00:48:54.518 --> 00:48:56.358
Is there something wrong
with the videos, Gary?


395
00:48:56.437 --> 00:48:58.770
You've got it. 
We've lost six.

396
00:48:59.565 --> 00:49:02.182
- Did Sandy do that?
- Yes, she did.


397
00:49:02.735 --> 00:49:04.818
Why would she knock out the videos?

398
00:49:04.904 --> 00:49:06.861
I'll take care of this, Gary.

399
00:49:12.828 --> 00:49:14.444
That was a smart idea.

400
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:15.946
Switch on emergency.

401
00:49:18.167 --> 00:49:19.658
Where's Kate?

402
00:50:49.425 --> 00:50:50.586
Kate?

403
00:51:09.403 --> 00:51:12.487
- She's very strong!
- What weapons have you got?


404
00:51:12.573 --> 00:51:13.925
We've got to stop her,
not hurt her, Kate.


405
00:51:13.949 --> 00:51:16.178
There's only one way to stop her,
and that is to kill her.


406
00:51:16.202 --> 00:51:19.821
What do you suggest?
Do you know anything about that, Kate?


407
00:51:19.914 --> 00:51:21.121
Explosives.

408
00:51:38.682 --> 00:51:40.122
You wouldn't know where to detonate.

409
00:51:40.184 --> 00:51:41.745
With the videos out,
she could be anywhere.


410
00:51:41.769 --> 00:51:43.914
- Unless you were on the spot.
- We could use the touch burner.


411
00:51:43.938 --> 00:51:46.225
- What's that?
- Used for heat sealing.


412
00:51:46.315 --> 00:51:48.056
Burn right through her brain.

413
00:52:17.012 --> 00:52:19.470
- What do you suggest?
- Keeping her alive!


414
00:52:19.557 --> 00:52:22.641
He's the doctor.
Ask him how to keep her alive.


415
00:52:22.726 --> 00:52:25.764
- I could inject her with a drug.
- Shall I hold her arm while you do it?


416
00:52:25.854 --> 00:52:27.811
She's pregnant, Kate.

417
00:52:29.567 --> 00:52:32.059
That'll look great on the report.

418
00:52:32.152 --> 00:52:35.020
"The team were terrorised
by an expectant mother."


419
00:52:37.116 --> 00:52:39.950
She's blowing up the place.

420
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.743
Transmitter's out.
She's thinking fast.


421
00:52:42.871 --> 00:52:44.511
- What about Xeno?
- We're out of contact.


422
00:52:44.623 --> 00:52:46.831
<i>- Someone help me.</i>
- Sandy?


423
00:52:46.917 --> 00:52:48.704
She's in the exercise room.

424
00:52:48.794 --> 00:52:51.286
- Holly, I'm going to her.
- Don't be a fool, Karl.


425
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.872
Holly, I'm a doctor, and she's in pain.

426
00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:56.152
- She might have gotten hurt in that...
- I'll decide who goes!


427
00:52:56.176 --> 00:52:57.292
Well?

428
00:52:57.386 --> 00:52:59.719
If I can restrain her with the burner,
can you sedate her?


429
00:52:59.805 --> 00:53:01.137
I'll get my things.

430
00:53:01.223 --> 00:53:03.340
- Where's the touch burner?
- Preparation chamber.


431
00:53:03.434 --> 00:53:06.142
- Stay here, Gary, please.
- Yes, sir.


432
00:53:08.314 --> 00:53:10.556
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

433
00:53:10.649 --> 00:53:14.142
Help me.

434
00:53:17.156 --> 00:53:20.274
Someone, please.

435
00:53:27.583 --> 00:53:29.825
Help...

436
00:53:30.544 --> 00:53:32.080
please.

437
00:54:59.508 --> 00:55:01.465
Come on.

438
00:55:44.136 --> 00:55:47.470
It's all right, Sandy,
it's all right. Come on.


439
00:55:48.474 --> 00:55:49.754
- It's all right.
- Now, Sandy...


440
00:55:49.808 --> 00:55:54.178
Now come on, take it easy.
I'm here, okay? Just relax.


441
00:55:54.521 --> 00:55:56.558
Give me your hand. That's it.

442
00:55:56.648 --> 00:55:58.435
- Now take it easy, come on.
- Ssh.


443
00:55:58.525 --> 00:56:01.268
- That's right. Now...
- It's okay.


444
00:56:01.361 --> 00:56:03.978
- Come on now, just relax.
- Don't worry.


445
00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:06.735
Take it easy, that's it.

446
00:56:06.825 --> 00:56:10.114
- Don't worry. It's all right.
- Hold her, Sharon.


447
00:56:10.204 --> 00:56:12.742
- Just relax, come on.
- It's all right.


448
00:56:12.831 --> 00:56:14.711
It's not going to...

449
00:56:14.792 --> 00:56:16.033
No!

450
00:56:19.296 --> 00:56:21.253
Come here, Sandy. Come on.

451
00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.047
Come on!

452
00:56:29.973 --> 00:56:32.761
- You've got to keep steady, Karl.
- Holly!


453
00:56:34.978 --> 00:56:37.641
- Out of my way!
- Holly!


454
00:56:44.404 --> 00:56:46.521
No! No!

455
00:56:48.659 --> 00:56:50.150
No!

456
00:56:54.039 --> 00:56:57.407
Sharon! Help me!

457
00:57:00.254 --> 00:57:02.837
Sharon! Sharon!

458
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:05.916
Sharon!

459
00:57:08.846 --> 00:57:11.338
No! No!

460
00:57:11.974 --> 00:57:14.717
Help!

461
00:57:21.233 --> 00:57:22.599
Watch it, Mark.

462
00:57:26.613 --> 00:57:28.980
Okay, come on, Sharon.

463
00:57:29.074 --> 00:57:31.612
Watch your leg.
Put your arm around me.


464
00:57:31.702 --> 00:57:33.864
- Please, help me.
- Are you okay?


465
00:57:42.588 --> 00:57:44.170
Come on.

466
00:57:44.256 --> 00:57:46.213
Come on. Kate?

467
00:57:46.925 --> 00:57:48.962
Get her to the chair.

468
00:57:49.052 --> 00:57:50.714
Have you seen her?

469
00:57:52.306 --> 00:57:54.548
- What is it?
- It's her leg.


470
00:57:55.726 --> 00:57:58.685
Let me have a look.

471
00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:00.727
Where are the others?

472
00:58:00.814 --> 00:58:04.148
- Come on, it's all right.
- Gary, I don't know.


473
00:58:04.234 --> 00:58:06.692
She'll be okay, it's not broken.

474
00:58:21.043 --> 00:58:23.000
How are we gonna stop this?

475
00:58:23.086 --> 00:58:25.373
Well, if we can get to
the space preparation chamber,


476
00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:27.000
we've still got picks there.

477
00:58:27.132 --> 00:58:28.651
- It's no good.
- Look, we've got to try something.


478
00:58:28.675 --> 00:58:31.793
- There are chainsaws.
- She's too strong.


479
00:58:32.804 --> 00:58:35.842
<i>You can't get away from me, you know.</i>

480
00:58:35.933 --> 00:58:38.266
<i>It doesn't matter what you do,</i>

481
00:58:38.393 --> 00:58:40.680
you'll have to come out sometime.

482
00:58:43.482 --> 00:58:45.519
There's no other way.

483
00:58:47.486 --> 00:58:49.443
So why don't you...

484
00:58:49.529 --> 00:58:51.816
all just come out now?

485
00:58:57.037 --> 00:58:58.448
Mark?

486
00:58:59.873 --> 00:59:01.865
<i>Mark.</i>

487
00:59:02.417 --> 00:59:04.409
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

488
00:59:06.546 --> 00:59:08.503
This is our chance.

489
00:59:08.924 --> 00:59:10.540
<i>For you.</i>

490
00:59:11.259 --> 00:59:13.421
<i>You needn't be like the others.</i>

491
00:59:14.096 --> 00:59:16.088
What do you think?

492
00:59:16.723 --> 00:59:19.966
You keep her occupied,
we'll get the equipment.


493
00:59:22.729 --> 00:59:24.721
Why don't you just...

494
00:59:25.273 --> 00:59:27.060
open the door?

495
00:59:28.986 --> 00:59:30.978
<i>It would be so easy.</i>

496
00:59:34.866 --> 00:59:36.448
<i>Mark?</i>

497
00:59:37.369 --> 00:59:38.860
Mark.

498
00:59:40.872 --> 00:59:43.364
I'm waiting for you.

499
00:59:46.086 --> 00:59:47.577
<i>Mark?</i>

500
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:51.922
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

501
00:59:54.511 --> 00:59:57.094
Our best bet's the derelict passages.

502
00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.172
She won't look for us there.

503
01:00:03.562 --> 01:00:05.053
Mark!

504
01:00:07.482 --> 01:00:10.691
Mark, I'm waiting for you!

505
01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:20.951
Mark!

506
01:00:22.998 --> 01:00:25.240
Please, help me!

507
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.786
Sandy?

508
01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:29.035
Sandy, can you hear me?

509
01:00:34.384 --> 01:00:35.795
Sandy?

510
01:00:37.512 --> 01:00:39.094
Mark...

511
01:00:41.099 --> 01:00:43.091
I need you.

512
01:00:43.935 --> 01:00:46.518
Sandy...

513
01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:49.018
I promise you, 
I'll help you.

514
01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:50.769
I promise you.

515
01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:53.316
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

516
01:01:10.962 --> 01:01:12.043
Oh!

517
01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:14.042
Kate!

518
01:01:15.467 --> 01:01:16.958
What was that?

519
01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:20.386
Mark?

520
01:01:20.472 --> 01:01:23.055
- No...
- Kate! Quiet, woman.


521
01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:27.055
Sa...

522
01:01:27.145 --> 01:01:28.145
Sandy?

523
01:01:28.688 --> 01:01:30.725
<i>- Sandy?</i>
- You can't escape me.


524
01:01:30.816 --> 01:01:33.559
Is that out?

525
01:01:34.152 --> 01:01:36.690
Sandy?

526
01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.318
- Is that off?
- I don't know.


527
01:01:39.407 --> 01:01:40.488
Sandy?

528
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.263
Quickly, let's get out of here.

529
01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:16.768
Oh!

530
01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:14.705
Oh!

531
01:03:45.784 --> 01:03:46.784
Kate!

532
01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:49.277
Move, woman!

533
01:03:58.838 --> 01:04:01.046
Ohh...

534
01:05:39.397 --> 01:05:42.060
- Mark?
<i>- Yeah, Gary. You all right?</i>


535
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:43.812
<i>Where are you?</i>

536
01:05:43.902 --> 01:05:46.360
Outside the airlock.

537
01:05:46.488 --> 01:05:48.730
What the hell are you doing out there?

538
01:05:48.823 --> 01:05:50.030
<i>She chased me out.</i>

539
01:05:50.992 --> 01:05:55.407
I'm okay, but I don't know
how long I can stay out here.


540
01:05:55.538 --> 01:05:56.904
Is your air system functioning?

541
01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:01.541
It's fine.

542
01:06:02.003 --> 01:06:04.211
You worry about yourself, Harvard.

543
01:06:16.768 --> 01:06:18.600
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- Gary, what's the matter?


544
01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:25.186
She's...

545
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:28.731
she's breathing the atmosphere.

546
01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:30.814
She's... she's what?

547
01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:34.449
Oh, no.

548
01:06:46.172 --> 01:06:48.459
Gary! Gary!

549
01:07:05.358 --> 01:07:06.894
Help me.

550
01:07:08.778 --> 01:07:10.690
Help me.

551
01:07:49.027 --> 01:07:50.234
Gary!

552
01:07:51.112 --> 01:07:52.694
Gary?

553
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.902
<i>He's here with me, Mark.</i>

554
01:07:55.992 --> 01:07:59.406
Damn it! We're dead!

555
01:07:59.496 --> 01:08:02.489
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?


556
01:08:02.582 --> 01:08:06.041
I'm going to kill her.
I am going to kill her. No!


557
01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:08.877
- Get those lights... get the lights on!
- Don't leave us.


558
01:10:20.219 --> 01:10:22.336
No! No!

559
01:11:10.228 --> 01:11:11.719
No!

560
01:11:13.022 --> 01:11:15.184
No! No!

561
01:15:17.683 --> 01:15:20.471
Mark!

562
01:15:23.522 --> 01:15:26.390
- Kate, what the hell are you...?
- Jesus, what have you got in there?


563
01:15:26.484 --> 01:15:28.020
- Come on, Kate!
- In there.


564
01:15:29.403 --> 01:15:31.690
All right, Kate, get her in here.
Can you carry...?


565
01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:33.864
I'll get the door. Let her go...

566
01:15:35.534 --> 01:15:37.526
Over there.

567
01:15:47.213 --> 01:15:50.422
- She's gonna come looking for them.
- That's right.


568
01:15:54.553 --> 01:15:56.294
Lock the door.

569
01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:04.553
Lock it, Sharon.

570
01:16:31.757 --> 01:16:33.589
No!

571
01:18:03.432 --> 01:18:05.014
Ah...

572
01:18:55.693 --> 01:18:57.685

Strangled.

Internal disturbance of some kind.
