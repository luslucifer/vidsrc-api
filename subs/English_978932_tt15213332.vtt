1
00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:13.426
(eerie music)

2
00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.378
- [John] I started lying
almost 50 years ago


3
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:32.911
about what they did to me.

4
00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:35.382
The government
knows who they are.


5
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.019
It's time for both of
us to tell the truth.


6
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:48.160
(eerie music)

7
00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:08.047
(tap water running)

8
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.016
(door creaks open)

9
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:32.871
- [Reporter] After
decades of public denial,


10
00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.108
the Pentagon now admits
there's something out there.


11
00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.646
- There's enough
obvious evidence here


12
00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.047
that we need to
take this seriously


13
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.950
- There are a lot more sightings
than have been made public.


14
00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:48.087
We're talking about objects
that engage in actions


15
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.922
that are difficult to explain.

16
00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:53.058
- There's footage and
records of objects


17
00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:56.228
that we don't know
exactly what they are.


18
00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:59.932
- UAPs are real physical
objects and they're not ours.


19
00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:00.667
- [Luis] It is real.

20
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.101
The question is, what is it?

21
00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:03.035
And how does it work?

22
00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:03.636
- [George] They're not clouds.

23
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.970
They're not birds.

24
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:06.071
These are physical objects.

25
00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:09.309
- With no wings, no control
surfaces, no engines.


26
00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:11.176
And yet somehow
they're able to fly.


27
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.011
- Pyramid shaped UFOs

28
00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:16.649
and advanced trans
medium vehicles
descending into the water


29
00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:18.917
while swarming our Navy ships.

30
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.254
- [Reporter] They outperform
some of the very best aircraft


31
00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:22.489
that we have in our inventory.

32
00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:25.358
- Doesn't seem to be
any of our adversaries


33
00:02:25.392 --> 00:02:27.260
or near peer technology.

34
00:02:27.293 --> 00:02:28.628
- Are we really
dealing with something


35
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:32.030
that's a paradigm
moment for our species.


36
00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.667
- [Don] What was as once
considered a joke is now seen


37
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:38.237
by a lot of people as a genuine
national security issue.


38
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.105
- Who's operating
these machines.


39
00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.341
Why are they here?

40
00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:42.908
What do they want with us?

41
00:02:44.711 --> 00:02:46.979
- I understood it was a UFO.

42
00:02:47.012 --> 00:02:50.717
It's rotating, and it's
moving, and it's moving closer.


43
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.085
- And in that moment,
in that instance,


44
00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:55.988
ships started to
pop up in the sky.


45
00:02:56.021 --> 00:03:00.393
- The next thing I remember,
I was flying into a craft.


46
00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:01.994
- The last time that
they came to my room,


47
00:03:02.027 --> 00:03:03.363
I was in my 20's.

48
00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:05.465
I had three beings
standing there.


49
00:03:05.498 --> 00:03:08.200
- And the being was
right next to my face.


50
00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:10.002
And all I could
see was it's face.


51
00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:13.606
- He saw two shadow beings
walking through our hallway


52
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.375
and going down the stairs.

53
00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:18.010
- And I knew I was dealing

54
00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:20.145
with lots of different
types of beings.


55
00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:24.049
- Oh my gosh, this
is not a dream.


56
00:03:24.082 --> 00:03:25.552
- Who's crazy now?

57
00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:26.486
Who's crazy now?

58
00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.720
You all thought I was crazy.

59
00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:28.555
Who's crazy now?

60
00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:29.422
Who can explain it?

61
00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:38.096
(eerie music)

62
00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:56.148
- Well, this is
where it all began.


63
00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:02.154
I haven't been back here
for almost 40 years.


64
00:04:06.493 --> 00:04:08.160
I'll tell you, if
this house could talk.


65
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.363
(eerie music)

66
00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.139
Something is happening,
it's undeniable.


67
00:04:54.172 --> 00:04:55.240
There are too many people

68
00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:58.444
from all around the world
saying the same things.


69
00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:01.648
Abductions have been
recorded since the 1920's,


70
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:03.816
but there's really no
way to know for certain


71
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.051
how long this has been going on.

72
00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.259
This subject has been
taboo for such a long time


73
00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:19.399
and been researched by many,
many people behind the scenes.


74
00:05:19.432 --> 00:05:23.101
In the '80s, there was a
man who was brave enough


75
00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:28.140
to come out in public and
catalog his own experiences.


76
00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:31.109
There's no one more prolific

77
00:05:31.143 --> 00:05:33.680
in this area than
Whitley Strieber.


78
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:38.818
Many people know Whitley
Strieber as an author


79
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:39.686
and a speaker.

80
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:42.722
He's so much more than that.

81
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.395
He is a true philosopher and
thought leader in this field.


82
00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.868
- What is actually there

83
00:05:55.902 --> 00:05:58.738
and what you're seeing may be
two entirely different things.


84
00:05:58.771 --> 00:06:02.240
The result of this
has been that we build


85
00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:04.577
what amount to
kind of folklores.


86
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:07.313
And I don't mean things
that are dreamed up.


87
00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:12.352
Folklore comes not from
imagination and dreams only.


88
00:06:13.753 --> 00:06:17.557
It also comes from perceptions
that we can't understand.


89
00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:21.394
"Fairy lore" of Northern Europe

90
00:06:21.427 --> 00:06:24.229
is a perfect example of this.

91
00:06:24.263 --> 00:06:28.668
This lore in the 17th, 18th
and early 19th centuries


92
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.338
was very ominous
and frightening.


93
00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:35.441
And if you went with them,
you might not come back.


94
00:06:36.576 --> 00:06:40.713
That was the way
that world saw this.


95
00:06:40.747 --> 00:06:45.752
It had no idea of galaxies, no
idea of the actual immensity


96
00:06:46.653 --> 00:06:48.688
of just the physical universe,

97
00:06:48.721 --> 00:06:50.623
and certainly no concept

98
00:06:50.657 --> 00:06:53.593
that there could be very
real parallel universes


99
00:06:53.626 --> 00:06:56.429
that might be capable of
interacting with this.


100
00:06:56.462 --> 00:06:58.698
Now, comes the 1940's.

101
00:06:59.832 --> 00:07:02.368
We are aware of outer space.

102
00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:04.570
We've thought about aliens

103
00:07:04.604 --> 00:07:07.273
and suddenly they show up.

104
00:07:07.306 --> 00:07:09.942
And what do we think now?

105
00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:12.478
The fairy folk of the 19th

106
00:07:12.512 --> 00:07:15.982
and 18th centuries become
the visitors and the aliens


107
00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:17.617
of the 20th century.

108
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.991
- I am here to discuss the
so-called flying saucers.


109
00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:26.191
The air force interest

110
00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:29.862
in this problem has been due
to our feeling of an obligation


111
00:07:29.896 --> 00:07:33.933
to identify and analyze to the
best of our ability anything


112
00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:37.937
in the air that may have the
possibility of threat or menace


113
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.505
to the United States.

114
00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:41.908
- The U.S. government has
been and studying UFOs


115
00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:44.242
for a very long time.

116
00:07:44.277 --> 00:07:45.411
As scientific advisor

117
00:07:45.445 --> 00:07:49.348
to the U.S Air Force under
project Sign and Blue Book,


118
00:07:49.382 --> 00:07:54.253
Professor Joseph Allen Hynek
applied the same discipline


119
00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:57.290
that he used to achieve
his astrophysics PhD


120
00:07:57.323 --> 00:07:59.492
to the study of this phenomena.

121
00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:02.261
- The panel had
deliberately moved


122
00:08:02.295 --> 00:08:04.597
to debunk the whole subject

123
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.968
and not to give it the
serious scientific attention


124
00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:10.703
which it deserved.

125
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:14.340
- [John] Later, he would develop
the classification system


126
00:08:14.373 --> 00:08:16.008
that has been adopted worldwide

127
00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:20.279
to scientifically examine each
aspect of these encounters.


128
00:08:21.547 --> 00:08:25.384
Close encounters of the first
kind involve a visual sighting


129
00:08:25.418 --> 00:08:26.352
of a UFO.

130
00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:32.692
Close encounters
of the second kind


131
00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:36.295
leave physical trace
evidence of the experience,


132
00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:38.397
a burn mark from the craft,

133
00:08:38.431 --> 00:08:41.501
material left behind
after the craft departed,


134
00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:46.038
radioactivity, or even an
unusual discomfort experienced


135
00:08:46.072 --> 00:08:49.442
by an individual in the form
of a physiological effect.


136
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.612
Close encounters of
the third kind center


137
00:08:52.645 --> 00:08:57.416
on the siting of actual entities
associated with the UFO.


138
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.452
These entities
usually seem ignorant


139
00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:01.921
of the human beings
watching their activities.


140
00:09:01.954 --> 00:09:06.359
On those occasions where the
UFO occupants do take notice


141
00:09:06.392 --> 00:09:08.361
of their human observers,

142
00:09:08.394 --> 00:09:10.563
that leads us to
consider close encounters


143
00:09:10.596 --> 00:09:12.064
of the fourth kind,

144
00:09:12.098 --> 00:09:15.768
which contain any
interaction between humans


145
00:09:15.802 --> 00:09:19.338
and entities associated
with the UFO sighting.


146
00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:23.075
These include actual
abductions of human beings.


147
00:09:23.109 --> 00:09:24.278
Just like most people,

148
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.480
I had no idea that this subject
was being taken so seriously


149
00:09:27.513 --> 00:09:30.983
by some of the most powerful
people in the world.


150
00:09:31.017 --> 00:09:33.719
- [Reporter] Lawmakers from
both political parties say


151
00:09:33.753 --> 00:09:37.356
it is time to determine whether
the objects pose a threat


152
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.925
to the U.S.

153
00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.359
- There's stuff flying
in our airspace.


154
00:09:40.393 --> 00:09:41.794
We don't know what it is.

155
00:09:41.828 --> 00:09:43.863
We need to find out,
that's my position on it.


156
00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:49.368
- [John] It was only
after I finally realized


157
00:09:49.402 --> 00:09:53.472
and admitted to
everyone that I, in fact


158
00:09:53.506 --> 00:09:55.875
had a close encounter
of the fourth kind


159
00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:57.643
that I started to
study the subject


160
00:09:57.677 --> 00:10:00.847
and was overwhelmed by
the amount of people


161
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.749
who had had a similar
experience to me.


162
00:10:05.184 --> 00:10:08.120
Incredible as it seems,
these abductions of people


163
00:10:08.154 --> 00:10:10.056
have been recorded
throughout history


164
00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:13.459
and are documented as far
back as the Old Testament.


165
00:10:13.492 --> 00:10:14.627
Most folks are familiar

166
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.430
with the fiery
chariots of the Bible,


167
00:10:17.463 --> 00:10:18.397
but as far as I could tell,

168
00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:21.133
the modern focus on
alien abduction started


169
00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:23.502
in the late 1950's.

170
00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:27.073
- [Announcer] Invaders from
Mars, capturing humans at will


171
00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:28.875
for their own sinister purposes.

172
00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:31.677
- There have been a certain
percentage of this volume


173
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:36.449
of reports that have been
made by credible observers


174
00:10:37.216 --> 00:10:39.485
of relatively incredible things.

175
00:10:40.186 --> 00:10:43.623
- [John] For example,
October, 1957,


176
00:10:43.656 --> 00:10:48.628
a 23 year old Brazilian farmer
named Antonio Vilas Boaz


177
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:51.130
was ploughing his
fields at night


178
00:10:51.163 --> 00:10:53.933
when he noticed a red
star growing rapidly
in the night sky.


179
00:10:55.568 --> 00:11:00.039
The star approached him taking
the form of a spacecraft.


180
00:11:00.072 --> 00:11:03.009
His escape was prevented
by three extraterrestrials


181
00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:05.511
who pulled him into
that spacecraft.


182
00:11:08.614 --> 00:11:10.116
In September, 1961,

183
00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.618
one of the most famous
alien abductions occurred


184
00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:14.120
in Lancaster, New Hampshire.

185
00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:17.223
At about 10:30 that night,

186
00:11:17.257 --> 00:11:20.559
Betty and Barney Hill observed
a bright light in the sky


187
00:11:20.593 --> 00:11:23.529
while driving home
from vacation.


188
00:11:36.976 --> 00:11:39.779
- [John] In October, 1973,
two fisherman, Charlie Hickson


189
00:11:39.812 --> 00:11:43.149
and Calvin Parker reported
to local law enforcement


190
00:11:43.182 --> 00:11:47.620
of being abducted by robot-like
aliens while night fishing


191
00:11:47.653 --> 00:11:50.489
on the Pascagoula
river in Mississippi.


192
00:11:50.523 --> 00:11:54.493
- It landed behind this
and we turned around,


193
00:11:54.527 --> 00:11:55.995
stood up and turned
around and looked


194
00:11:56.028 --> 00:11:58.265
and must have been
a door that opened


195
00:11:58.298 --> 00:12:00.099
where all the bright
lights come out of it.


196
00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:03.536
I seen three bulky looking
creatures coming toward us.


197
00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:05.871
So two of 'em got
a hold of Charlie.


198
00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:08.574
One of 'em got a hold of myself

199
00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:10.943
and the old big, ugly
creature that brought me in,


200
00:12:10.977 --> 00:12:14.213
he took me and laid me
on examination table.


201
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.821
- [John] January, 1976, three
women driving home one evening


202
00:12:21.854 --> 00:12:25.224
encountered a craft that seemed
to be following their car


203
00:12:25.258 --> 00:12:27.593
in Stanford, Kentucky.

204
00:12:27.626 --> 00:12:29.829
They tried in vain to
get away from the craft,


205
00:12:29.862 --> 00:12:31.063
but it centered in on them

206
00:12:31.097 --> 00:12:34.066
and took control
of their vehicle.


207
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:46.979
- [John] The women
escaped the car,


208
00:12:47.013 --> 00:12:49.582
but they all recount
that they were abducted


209
00:12:49.615 --> 00:12:51.917
and taken up into the craft.

210
00:13:01.894 --> 00:13:04.797
- [John] Terry Lovelace was on
a camping trip with a friend


211
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.567
in Devil's Den Sate Park
when both of them looked up


212
00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:12.104
and noticed some unusual,
bright lights in the sky.


213
00:13:12.138 --> 00:13:15.308
The lights formed into a craft

214
00:13:15.342 --> 00:13:17.543
and hovered 30 feet over them.

215
00:13:18.744 --> 00:13:20.212
They were taken too.

216
00:13:20.247 --> 00:13:21.647
- [Terry] I don't think

217
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.582
these things really
intended hurt us.


218
00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:28.621
They took us inside of this
craft incredibly brightly lit.


219
00:13:29.356 --> 00:13:30.823
And I think that's
why I came out of this


220
00:13:30.856 --> 00:13:33.592
with a severe sunburn.

221
00:13:33.626 --> 00:13:35.362
I had burns everywhere.

222
00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:39.198
Afterward, we calculated
that we had been out probably


223
00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:40.367
about four hours.

224
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.902
There are a lot of
crazy things out there.


225
00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:45.604
- This list is almost endless.

226
00:13:45.638 --> 00:13:46.839
It goes on and on.

227
00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:51.110
It gave me some comfort to
know that I was not alone.


228
00:13:51.143 --> 00:13:54.647
Other people, lots of them
from all walks of life


229
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.351
have experienced being
helplessly removed
from their homes,


230
00:13:58.385 --> 00:14:00.953
from their cars
and everything else


231
00:14:00.986 --> 00:14:02.822
that they considered reality.

232
00:14:04.257 --> 00:14:07.960
But it also pointed out
that I was no one special.


233
00:14:10.763 --> 00:14:14.733
Funny, but that was the thing
that calmed me most of all.


234
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.337
This entire film is an attempt

235
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.906
to have the audience see the
phenomena through my eyes


236
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.177
as I grapple with the truth,
understand what it might mean


237
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:26.846
and then try to live it.

238
00:14:28.315 --> 00:14:31.183
I wanted to ask the questions
that people are afraid to ask


239
00:14:31.217 --> 00:14:34.887
and get meaningful answers
that would unify experiencers


240
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.957
and folks that had no
idea this was going on


241
00:14:39.426 --> 00:14:42.027
so that we could all face
what is speeding toward us


242
00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:44.663
as one people together.

243
00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:47.867
I felt alone.

244
00:14:49.235 --> 00:14:52.439
I was looking for some
encouragement, some solace.


245
00:14:52.472 --> 00:14:57.676
I was amazed to find out how
many hundreds of thousands


246
00:15:01.013 --> 00:15:04.183
of people have claimed contact.

247
00:15:04.216 --> 00:15:06.785
And I'm not talking about
shiny lights in the sky.


248
00:15:06.819 --> 00:15:09.788
I'm talking about an
entity right beside you


249
00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:11.291
because that's a
different thing.


250
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.429
I found out that there were
people all around the country


251
00:15:16.463 --> 00:15:19.698
that would get together and
share their experiences.


252
00:15:32.379 --> 00:15:33.779
When I got to Big Arb,

253
00:15:33.812 --> 00:15:36.215
I was blown away by
how beautiful it was,


254
00:15:36.249 --> 00:15:39.452
but more so how beautiful
those people were


255
00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:41.321
and how giving and
honest they were.


256
00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:49.128
Each one of them had had a
different type of experience.


257
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:50.829
They were all otherworldly.

258
00:15:51.864 --> 00:15:52.798
They were strange.

259
00:15:52.831 --> 00:15:53.732
They were different.

260
00:15:53.766 --> 00:15:55.335
They were different than mine.

261
00:15:55.368 --> 00:15:57.304
I kind of thought that
everything would be the same,


262
00:15:57.337 --> 00:15:58.371
but the truth

263
00:15:58.405 --> 00:16:01.740
is they came in every
different shape and size.


264
00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:07.780
- I'm Kimberly Marie, and I
am a lifelong experiencer.


265
00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:11.150
I'm an Intuitive Empath.

266
00:16:11.183 --> 00:16:15.488
I'm a Yogi of 30 years
and I'm a mother.


267
00:16:15.522 --> 00:16:19.825
I have two daughters and
I'm a spiritual seeker.


268
00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:24.230
The earliest experience
that I remember,


269
00:16:24.264 --> 00:16:26.165
I was in grade school.

270
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.736
I had this feeling that
I was being watched.


271
00:16:31.904 --> 00:16:33.138
I would get up in the
middle of the night


272
00:16:33.172 --> 00:16:35.542
and I would look
out at the woods.


273
00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:39.546
And I had a very acute awareness
that there was something


274
00:16:39.579 --> 00:16:41.747
in those woods that
was watching me.


275
00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:47.487
I also had experiences
having beings in my room.


276
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.655
There would be one being,

277
00:16:48.688 --> 00:16:52.224
and it would be just sitting
there quietly watching me.


278
00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:54.093
I would feel
impressions on my bed


279
00:16:54.126 --> 00:16:56.463
as if somebody was coming
to sit on the end of my bed


280
00:16:56.496 --> 00:16:57.530
or next to me.

281
00:16:57.564 --> 00:17:01.534
I felt the presence of
somebody sitting in my car


282
00:17:01.568 --> 00:17:03.403
or walking behind me.

283
00:17:03.436 --> 00:17:05.237
I could feel their breath.

284
00:17:05.272 --> 00:17:09.108
I was having experiences
that were unexplainable.


285
00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:11.910
They don't just
come to everyone.


286
00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:34.927
- I decided to
call these entities


287
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.231
that I was engaging
with visitors


288
00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:44.270
because I thought that the
word aliens was a step too far.


289
00:18:45.137 --> 00:18:47.206
Are they entities as they appear

290
00:18:47.239 --> 00:18:49.409
or is it some kind
of a phenomenon


291
00:18:49.442 --> 00:18:53.011
that projects itself into us?

292
00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:54.947
Has it been here forever?

293
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.217
Maybe from the
beginning of time even?


294
00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:01.688
One thing they certainly are,
are visitors in the lives


295
00:19:01.721 --> 00:19:03.390
of those who encounter them.

296
00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:10.996
- I'm Alanna, and I'm
just an average person,


297
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:15.402
but I've come to realize
that I'm also an experiencer.


298
00:19:15.435 --> 00:19:18.971
I was living on my
grandparents' farm.


299
00:19:19.004 --> 00:19:22.141
I was just a little girl when
I had my first experience.


300
00:19:22.174 --> 00:19:24.943
I was in a completely
black space


301
00:19:24.977 --> 00:19:29.516
and I was standing beside what
you would call a gray alien.


302
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:34.554
It's about my size, gray,
large almond shaped eyes.


303
00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:36.489
I'm a bit alarmed

304
00:19:36.523 --> 00:19:38.658
because it's nothing
I've ever seen before.


305
00:19:38.691 --> 00:19:43.296
Suddenly, I realized I'm laying
back in my bed, motionless


306
00:19:43.329 --> 00:19:47.199
and I'm looking up and the
being is just looking at me.


307
00:19:47.232 --> 00:19:50.002
And as I'm lying there,

308
00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:53.706
the being space is changing
into the photo of the white cat


309
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.174
on my wall.

310
00:19:55.207 --> 00:19:56.208
It was nothing I'd
ever seen before.


311
00:19:56.241 --> 00:19:59.077
I'd never seen a
being like that.


312
00:20:00.212 --> 00:20:01.381
- I'm Melissa Cain.

313
00:20:01.414 --> 00:20:03.683
I am a doting wife
and a mother of three


314
00:20:03.716 --> 00:20:05.217
and three fur babies as well.

315
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:07.085
And I'm a business owner.

316
00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:11.257
Unlike my friends, and
other people, and books


317
00:20:11.291 --> 00:20:13.460
that I've read and movies
that I've seen about people


318
00:20:13.493 --> 00:20:18.197
who have contact, they see
beings, they see giant craft,


319
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.065
I never had any of that.

320
00:20:20.098 --> 00:20:22.469
At a very young age, I
would see in the middle


321
00:20:22.502 --> 00:20:25.237
of the night are scenes flying

322
00:20:25.271 --> 00:20:28.341
by me like movies, really fast.

323
00:20:28.374 --> 00:20:29.576
I could never slow 'em down.

324
00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:30.743
I could never see
what was happening.


325
00:20:30.777 --> 00:20:33.078
I couldn't stop them to see

326
00:20:33.111 --> 00:20:34.747
what I was supposed
to be looking at.


327
00:20:34.781 --> 00:20:37.450
And it was terrifying because
I couldn't slow it down.


328
00:20:38.585 --> 00:20:41.186
After the scenes
would be flying by me,


329
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.789
I would see a gray screen

330
00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:45.658
and there would be a thin
line going through the middle


331
00:20:45.692 --> 00:20:48.661
of it, kind of like a
heartbeat type line.


332
00:20:48.695 --> 00:20:52.130
And when that cord was
straight, I was safe.


333
00:20:52.164 --> 00:20:54.567
But when that cord kind
of crunched together


334
00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:56.703
and would wave up and down,

335
00:20:56.736 --> 00:20:58.705
that's when I felt like
I was losing my breath


336
00:20:58.738 --> 00:20:59.806
and I was gonna die.

337
00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:01.307
These kind of faded away

338
00:21:01.341 --> 00:21:04.076
when I was kind of
reaching middle school,


339
00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:06.613
but it did for many,
many years make me afraid


340
00:21:06.646 --> 00:21:08.046
to go to sleep at night.

341
00:21:08.848 --> 00:21:12.318
- Screen memories in
the contact experience


342
00:21:12.352 --> 00:21:14.420
have two purposes.

343
00:21:14.454 --> 00:21:18.324
One is to shield the
individual from a memory


344
00:21:18.358 --> 00:21:20.627
that they can't bear.

345
00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.061
Two is it's a test.

346
00:21:23.095 --> 00:21:25.565
Are you gonna break
through the screen memory?


347
00:21:25.598 --> 00:21:28.301
Can you bear it after all?

348
00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:31.437
So the screen memory
has two purposes.


349
00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:33.171
It is to let you off the hook

350
00:21:33.205 --> 00:21:36.241
if your soul does not
want to engage in contact,


351
00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:38.545
and it is there
to be broken down


352
00:21:38.578 --> 00:21:42.080
if you do want to
make that step.


353
00:21:43.483 --> 00:21:46.553
- I'm Stacy McArdle
and I'm from Illinois


354
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.824
and I'm an experiencer,
and a seeker,


355
00:21:51.858 --> 00:21:54.460
and I'm just full of wonderment.

356
00:21:55.662 --> 00:21:58.163
From a very young age,
I just had a knowing


357
00:21:58.196 --> 00:22:01.133
that I came from another place.

358
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:04.504
I had been telepathically
communicating with beings


359
00:22:04.537 --> 00:22:07.607
from other planets ever
since I could remember.


360
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:13.646
I had memories of being in a
room, getting ready to be born


361
00:22:14.514 --> 00:22:16.114
before I came to this planet,

362
00:22:16.148 --> 00:22:18.851
before I was in
my mom's stomach.


363
00:22:18.885 --> 00:22:21.788
I was in this nondescript room

364
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:26.826
with everything from human
spirits, to elementals, to ETs.


365
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.631
We were called to this gentleman
that was manning a door


366
00:22:31.664 --> 00:22:34.367
and we all lined up
and he opened the door


367
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.202
and all this sunlight flooded in

368
00:22:37.235 --> 00:22:39.439
and we were on
top of a mountain.


369
00:22:39.472 --> 00:22:43.141
There were two rivers with
a strip of land in between,


370
00:22:43.175 --> 00:22:46.646
jumping into that river meant
you were gonna be born soon.


371
00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:50.148
I was immersed in the water
and it was crystal clear


372
00:22:50.182 --> 00:22:51.651
and there were colored fish.

373
00:22:51.684 --> 00:22:53.886
And all the plant life
was very vibrantly colored


374
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.591
and all of a sudden
this human-size fish
shows up next to me


375
00:22:58.625 --> 00:23:01.294
and he's telepathically
communicating with me.


376
00:23:01.327 --> 00:23:04.196
He was telling me what to expect
and what was gonna happen.


377
00:23:04.229 --> 00:23:05.832
I knew I was gonna
go to another planet.


378
00:23:05.865 --> 00:23:07.800
I knew who my mother
was going to be.


379
00:23:07.834 --> 00:23:10.770
And then all of a
sudden I was born.


380
00:23:10.803 --> 00:23:13.171
Over the years,
more puzzle pieces


381
00:23:13.205 --> 00:23:16.542
from that memory come
together and solidify it.


382
00:23:16.576 --> 00:23:20.313
So I always knew that I
came from another planet.


383
00:23:23.215 --> 00:23:24.517
- I'm Jan Jander.

384
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.218
I'm a Designer by trade,

385
00:23:26.252 --> 00:23:28.454
and I'm also an experiencer.

386
00:23:29.822 --> 00:23:33.559
My first experience that I
remember, I was seven years old


387
00:23:33.593 --> 00:23:36.596
and we were on a flight
to the Philippines.


388
00:23:36.629 --> 00:23:39.532
The sun was coming up and I
was just glued to the window.


389
00:23:39.565 --> 00:23:41.834
When my gaze shifted
up to the horizon,


390
00:23:41.868 --> 00:23:46.406
boom, out of thin air is a
classic UFO, like a saucer.


391
00:23:46.439 --> 00:23:49.709
It was as if the whole
thing was made out of metal


392
00:23:49.742 --> 00:23:51.678
that was highly reflective.

393
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:54.414
I could tell that it
had a slight rotation.


394
00:23:54.447 --> 00:23:56.949
Shortly thereafter,
it just zipped.


395
00:23:56.983 --> 00:24:01.921
It just instantaneous
acceleration, but just so fast.


396
00:24:01.954 --> 00:24:03.690
It lit a fire in me

397
00:24:03.723 --> 00:24:07.225
that continued through
elementary school.


398
00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.563
Most people hadn't
had a UFO experience.


399
00:24:10.596 --> 00:24:13.866
And so I was kind
of alone in that.


400
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.002
I believed it and
I knew it was true,


401
00:24:16.035 --> 00:24:19.605
but my dad showed me
the "Condon Report".


402
00:24:19.639 --> 00:24:22.975
And when they concluded that
there was nothing to it,


403
00:24:23.009 --> 00:24:27.313
I knew with everything in me
that that report was wrong.


404
00:24:27.346 --> 00:24:30.883
Right around when I
had the UFO experience,


405
00:24:30.917 --> 00:24:31.984
I had gone to bed.

406
00:24:32.018 --> 00:24:34.020
At some point, I woke up
in the middle of the night


407
00:24:34.053 --> 00:24:37.457
and when I looked at the
corner, my room was illuminated.


408
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.693
I tilt outta bed, and there
he is, the popcorn man.


409
00:24:41.894 --> 00:24:43.396
And he is on a bicycle.

410
00:24:43.429 --> 00:24:44.931
There's this giant popcorn.

411
00:24:44.964 --> 00:24:48.034
It's like two big
popcorn containers


412
00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:49.969
hanging off the front wheel.

413
00:24:50.002 --> 00:24:53.339
And everything is covered
in this thin vertical,


414
00:24:53.372 --> 00:24:55.441
yellow and red stripes.

415
00:24:55.475 --> 00:24:58.344
He had a straw hat and
on it was a ribbon.


416
00:24:58.377 --> 00:25:01.347
He had a tie, a vest,
three-piece-suit.


417
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.952
And his skin was white like
a clown, curly black hair.


418
00:25:05.985 --> 00:25:08.354
He had weird blue eyes.

419
00:25:08.387 --> 00:25:10.490
The whole, where
your eyeball would be


420
00:25:10.523 --> 00:25:13.392
was this glowing
baby blue light.


421
00:25:13.426 --> 00:25:15.595
He was very, very skinny.

422
00:25:15.628 --> 00:25:18.531
I guessed, he was like seven,
seven and a half feet tall.


423
00:25:18.564 --> 00:25:20.767
And I am completely stunned.

424
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.805
I freeze, and I'm
like this, what, no!


425
00:25:27.073 --> 00:25:31.010
And eventually, he slowly,
his head started to turn.


426
00:25:31.043 --> 00:25:32.411
He started to turn.

427
00:25:32.445 --> 00:25:34.480
I knew he was coming
in my direction.


428
00:25:34.514 --> 00:25:36.382
The last thing I remember
of the experience


429
00:25:36.415 --> 00:25:39.385
is when he made eye contact
with me and then it was gone.


430
00:25:39.418 --> 00:25:40.586
It was game over.

431
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.356
And I don't even
know what happened.


432
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:45.825
That was the end of the memory.

433
00:25:45.858 --> 00:25:50.863
- In order to think clearly
about what we are seeing,


434
00:25:52.365 --> 00:25:55.601
the place we have to go
is to the brain itself.


435
00:25:55.635 --> 00:26:00.573
It organizes these
perceptions into forms


436
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.443
that the mind can then evaluate.

437
00:26:05.912 --> 00:26:10.316
But if you have no way at all
from your past of relating it


438
00:26:11.484 --> 00:26:13.386
to anything, you're
going to build it


439
00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:15.488
out of your imagination.

440
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:19.826
And even though it's there,
what is actually there


441
00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:22.962
and what you're seeing may
to entirely different things,


442
00:26:22.995 --> 00:26:24.530
and you can't tell.

443
00:26:25.965 --> 00:26:29.535
- My name is Ruth and I'm
from Wisconsin, West Central


444
00:26:29.569 --> 00:26:30.636
to be more specific.

445
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.338
I live in a rural area.

446
00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:38.344
My first experience, I
remember seeing stars,


447
00:26:39.412 --> 00:26:41.113
beautiful stars in the ceiling.

448
00:26:41.147 --> 00:26:44.884
The stars made me feel
full of wonder I guess.


449
00:26:44.917 --> 00:26:46.152
I started to realize

450
00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:50.890
that it wasn't what it
was appearing to be.


451
00:26:50.923 --> 00:26:52.959
Then I started to
become more afraid.


452
00:26:54.427 --> 00:26:59.098
I remember floating up above
my bed, up above the house.


453
00:27:00.499 --> 00:27:04.470
I was kind of flying and I knew
that I was going someplace.


454
00:27:04.503 --> 00:27:05.738
I couldn't see the craft.

455
00:27:05.771 --> 00:27:07.506
I believe it must
have been cloaked,


456
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.041
but I knew it was above me.

457
00:27:09.075 --> 00:27:11.410
And I knew I was going into it.

458
00:27:15.147 --> 00:27:17.183
I must have gotten
some communication


459
00:27:17.216 --> 00:27:20.052
because I knew what
I was supposed to do.


460
00:27:20.086 --> 00:27:23.856
I mean, when I went from the
waiting room to the exam table,


461
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.425
I knew I was
supposed to do this.


462
00:27:26.459 --> 00:27:29.495
Either I thought it, or I
actually said the words,


463
00:27:29.528 --> 00:27:32.932
"Ruth, this is not a
dream, this is real."


464
00:27:32.965 --> 00:27:35.534
Then I was back in my
bed and it was all done.


465
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.843
(eerie music)

466
00:27:58.658 --> 00:28:01.093
- [John] I'm always
amazed when someone says


467
00:28:01.127 --> 00:28:02.828
that they have
all of the answers


468
00:28:02.862 --> 00:28:05.531
about who the ET visitors are

469
00:28:05.564 --> 00:28:07.667
and the nature of their agendas.

470
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.504
I wonder, "How can
that possibly be?"


471
00:28:11.537 --> 00:28:15.541
Take for example, Earthlings
quest to land on Mars.


472
00:28:16.742 --> 00:28:20.546
Just suppose the crew was made
up of someone from Africa,


473
00:28:20.579 --> 00:28:24.083
China, Germany, and Scandinavia.

474
00:28:24.116 --> 00:28:25.785
If there were Martians

475
00:28:25.818 --> 00:28:28.087
and they came out to
greet these visitors,


476
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.757
could they identify the
true, extraterrestrial?


477
00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:34.760
Because of these visitors'
genetics and evolution,


478
00:28:34.794 --> 00:28:37.096
they all look
drastically different.


479
00:28:37.129 --> 00:28:41.801
In addition to that, they might
all have different agendas,


480
00:28:41.834 --> 00:28:46.238
scientific advancement,
military conquest,


481
00:28:46.273 --> 00:28:50.643
industrial development,
or peaceful exploration,


482
00:28:52.044 --> 00:28:56.515
and all of that in one
spaceship from one planet!


483
00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.853
If we accept that life is
prolific in the universe


484
00:29:00.886 --> 00:29:02.722
and that we're being visited,

485
00:29:02.755 --> 00:29:06.625
there is no way to
know everything about
every one of them.


486
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.664
They all cannot be evil
child-eating monsters.


487
00:29:12.598 --> 00:29:14.233
And by the same token,

488
00:29:14.267 --> 00:29:18.771
they cannot all be ultra
spiritual benevolent beings.


489
00:29:18.804 --> 00:29:20.906
I mean hell, look at us,

490
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.609
we've got a lot of work
to do on our altruism


491
00:29:23.642 --> 00:29:25.511
and we're traveling
to other planets!


492
00:29:26.979 --> 00:29:31.083
To the Martians in our little
fable, we're the aliens.


493
00:29:45.197 --> 00:29:50.202
- In October of 1985, things
began to change in our life.


494
00:29:53.172 --> 00:29:56.343
There was an unusual
event that took place


495
00:29:56.376 --> 00:29:59.612
at the little cabin
in upstate New York.


496
00:29:59.645 --> 00:30:01.747
All of a sudden in the
middle of the night,


497
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.717
the whole place lit
up like daylight.


498
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.624
And I noted there
was a great bang.


499
00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:15.795
I opened my eyes immediately
because of the cries


500
00:30:15.828 --> 00:30:18.030
of my son downstairs.

501
00:30:18.064 --> 00:30:21.167
The light was pouring
in the windows,


502
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.670
but by the time I'd gotten
downstairs, the light was gone,


503
00:30:26.105 --> 00:30:28.841
but I got a shotgun
and I got a pistol.


504
00:30:28.874 --> 00:30:31.811
I got an alarm system.

505
00:30:31.844 --> 00:30:34.046
I could literally
not sleep a night


506
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.715
in that house without
that alarm system.


507
00:30:36.749 --> 00:30:41.720
And I found myself patrolling
the area with the shotgun.


508
00:30:42.988 --> 00:30:45.624
I became aware of
a presence near me.


509
00:30:46.992 --> 00:30:49.829
And that was the beginning
of a real dissent,


510
00:30:49.862 --> 00:30:51.664
almost into madness.

511
00:30:52.965 --> 00:30:56.769
The fear that's connected
with this is the same fear


512
00:30:56.802 --> 00:31:00.639
that a wild animal feels
when it's captured.


513
00:31:00.673 --> 00:31:04.677
We will attack if cornered,
we will run if we can.


514
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.214
And when it does happen to
us, and it overwhelms us,


515
00:31:08.248 --> 00:31:12.385
and devastates our egos,
and leaves us in a situation


516
00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:15.855
of helplessness in the
hands of the unknown,


517
00:31:15.888 --> 00:31:20.025
we will as often as not
simply bury that memory.


518
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.905
(door creaks open)

519
00:31:32.938 --> 00:31:34.707
- It's taken me a long time

520
00:31:36.476 --> 00:31:38.210
to be able to talk about this

521
00:31:38.244 --> 00:31:43.250
because it's been so bizarre,
and strange and unbelievable.


522
00:31:44.451 --> 00:31:45.784
And also because
I was told not to.


523
00:31:47.454 --> 00:31:52.825
Some really big-hearted
friends who knew about this


524
00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:56.363
and knew that something
just wasn't right.


525
00:31:57.264 --> 00:31:59.266
And through many discussions,

526
00:31:59.299 --> 00:32:03.436
I finally was able to
come to terms with it


527
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.739
and admit it in public.

528
00:32:06.772 --> 00:32:08.040
And that was really hard.

529
00:32:10.477 --> 00:32:15.681
I was seven years old
and I was in my bedroom


530
00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:18.717
and it was in the
middle of the night.


531
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:22.455
And I awoke to hear this drone.

532
00:32:22.489 --> 00:32:24.790
So I rolled outta bed
and I decided I would go


533
00:32:24.823 --> 00:32:25.858
to the bathroom.

534
00:32:26.792 --> 00:32:29.228
I walk into the bathroom
and I shut the door


535
00:32:29.262 --> 00:32:31.830
and I turn on the water.

536
00:32:31.864 --> 00:32:33.999
I was just looking at the water.

537
00:32:34.033 --> 00:32:36.202
And I stood there
for a long time.


538
00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:39.406
And then I turned off the
water and I moved to my right


539
00:32:40.773 --> 00:32:43.476
and I opened up
the bathroom door.


540
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.177
And when I did,

541
00:32:45.211 --> 00:32:50.216
I was face to face with to
what my mind said was Ultraman.


542
00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.425
Ultraman was this character
in Japanese television.


543
00:32:58.458 --> 00:33:01.827
And he was a silver guy
with these huge eyes.


544
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.865
To my seven year old mind, I
was looking at that character,


545
00:33:07.866 --> 00:33:09.868
but we got very, very close.

546
00:33:09.902 --> 00:33:12.004
So I was eye to eye with him.

547
00:33:12.037 --> 00:33:14.441
He was no bigger than I was.

548
00:33:14.474 --> 00:33:17.810
And as he drew closer to me,

549
00:33:17.843 --> 00:33:22.848
I could feel myself being
pulled and I got afraid.


550
00:33:25.217 --> 00:33:27.019
I was terrified.

551
00:33:27.052 --> 00:33:30.523
And just then, there was
this huge flash of light,


552
00:33:30.557 --> 00:33:34.927
and there was this speeding,
kaleidoscope of lights.


553
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.962
And I felt cold, but I
didn't know where I was


554
00:33:36.996 --> 00:33:38.331
and what was going on.

555
00:33:38.365 --> 00:33:41.800
It felt like I was
traveling, but I was unsure.


556
00:33:41.834 --> 00:33:45.538
But then I was standing
again in that small hallway


557
00:33:45.572 --> 00:33:47.574
with this entity.

558
00:33:47.607 --> 00:33:51.810
But now this entity's
back was in the bathroom.


559
00:33:51.844 --> 00:33:56.283
And my back was facing
the hardwood stairs


560
00:33:56.316 --> 00:33:57.883
that were behind me.

561
00:33:57.916 --> 00:34:01.820
I can see him raise
his right hand.


562
00:34:01.854 --> 00:34:04.291
There is a brilliant
flash of light,


563
00:34:04.324 --> 00:34:07.960
and I felt the impact on
my shoulder, and I fell.


564
00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:13.132
And I landed at the
bottom of these stairs.


565
00:34:13.165 --> 00:34:16.536
And I heard my father scream,
"What the hell is that?"


566
00:34:16.569 --> 00:34:17.470
And my mother came out

567
00:34:17.504 --> 00:34:20.540
and they came to see
their son sprawled.


568
00:34:20.573 --> 00:34:24.943
And I am saying, "Ultraman is
in my room, he's upstairs!"


569
00:34:24.977 --> 00:34:29.282
I'm screaming, and my father
looks at me, he's upset.


570
00:34:29.316 --> 00:34:31.351
And he bounds up the stairs.

571
00:34:31.384 --> 00:34:33.919
He went room to room
and opened doors.


572
00:34:33.952 --> 00:34:36.055
And he came to the
top of the stairs.


573
00:34:36.088 --> 00:34:37.290
He looked down.

574
00:34:37.324 --> 00:34:41.860
And I'm crying and he
looked disappointed,


575
00:34:41.894 --> 00:34:44.063
maybe even a little disgusted.

576
00:34:44.096 --> 00:34:45.864
My father kind of
gives my mother a look


577
00:34:45.898 --> 00:34:50.903
like don't make a baby out of
this kid, walked me upstairs.


578
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:53.105
And they did what parents do.

579
00:34:53.138 --> 00:34:56.909
You look under the bed,
"See, there's nothing there."


580
00:34:56.942 --> 00:34:59.346
My mom gives me a
kiss on my forehead,


581
00:34:59.379 --> 00:35:01.113
tells me everything's
gonna be okay.


582
00:35:02.582 --> 00:35:07.086
A day later, my mom is telling
me that it's time for a bath.


583
00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.355
So she took my t-shirt off.

584
00:35:08.388 --> 00:35:11.123
And she said, "Honey,
what's this?",


585
00:35:11.156 --> 00:35:14.294
kinda like looking around to
make sure my dad wasn't around.


586
00:35:14.327 --> 00:35:17.464
"Well, I told you mom that
Ultraman was in my bedroom."


587
00:35:18.598 --> 00:35:19.998
A couple of days later,

588
00:35:20.032 --> 00:35:22.901
my father was taking
me to the doctor.


589
00:35:22.935 --> 00:35:24.136
And as we're pulling
in, he said to me,


590
00:35:24.169 --> 00:35:25.638
"Hey, listen, I
don't wanna hear any


591
00:35:25.672 --> 00:35:28.006
"of this Ultraman bullshit.

592
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.975
"You keep that to yourself."

593
00:35:30.008 --> 00:35:33.646
Doctor gave me an exam,
asked me about my shoulder.


594
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.684
Man, I saw my father,
he was glaring at me.


595
00:35:37.717 --> 00:35:42.921
So I said, "I don't know,
I was just out playin'."


596
00:35:44.056 --> 00:35:45.291
And as I was walking
out in the hall,


597
00:35:45.325 --> 00:35:47.092
I still remember him
talking to my father


598
00:35:47.126 --> 00:35:49.027
in hush tones saying something

599
00:35:49.061 --> 00:35:52.931
about some sort of a scar
brought on by intense heat.


600
00:35:53.733 --> 00:35:55.535
So I never thought
about it again.


601
00:35:55.568 --> 00:35:58.271
And my father said to me,

602
00:35:58.304 --> 00:36:00.239
"Just keep that to yourself.

603
00:36:00.273 --> 00:36:01.574
"Don't say anything.

604
00:36:01.608 --> 00:36:03.075
"I don't want you
scaring your sisters."


605
00:36:03.108 --> 00:36:05.043
That's the way it started.

606
00:36:05.077 --> 00:36:08.213
I was angry and I was afraid.

607
00:36:08.248 --> 00:36:10.383
And so I lied and I
lied so many times.


608
00:36:10.417 --> 00:36:12.151
I lied to myself.

609
00:36:12.184 --> 00:36:14.654
I've come to terms
with the event.


610
00:36:14.687 --> 00:36:17.657
If you look at it,
it's very distinct.


611
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:21.361
And there is a shape to it.

612
00:36:21.394 --> 00:36:25.298
There's physical evidence
that everything I say


613
00:36:25.331 --> 00:36:29.234
is real and happened and no
one can take that away from me.


614
00:36:31.036 --> 00:36:34.507
- Marks on the body
go back a long time.


615
00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:35.675
In the middle ages,

616
00:36:35.708 --> 00:36:39.011
if you were found to have an
unusual mark on your body,


617
00:36:39.044 --> 00:36:41.013
that might be considered
a witches mark


618
00:36:41.046 --> 00:36:43.249
and you might end
up being burned up.


619
00:36:43.283 --> 00:36:46.753
Many contact witnesses
have marks on their bodies.


620
00:36:46.786 --> 00:36:49.322
I have one on my body in fact.

621
00:36:49.355 --> 00:36:52.492
We're in contact with something
that wants them there.


622
00:36:53.626 --> 00:36:54.594
But what are they?

623
00:36:55.662 --> 00:36:57.664
What are they there for?

624
00:36:57.697 --> 00:37:00.467
What are they in our lives?

625
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.404
A mark has a specific
meaning to whoever it


626
00:37:04.437 --> 00:37:08.741
and probably a meaning that
is communicated to others


627
00:37:08.775 --> 00:37:12.044
that tells them something
about who you are


628
00:37:12.077 --> 00:37:15.682
and who you are working
with or belong to.


629
00:37:15.715 --> 00:37:19.419
Even, it could be that
these other entities


630
00:37:19.452 --> 00:37:22.455
that so many of us regard as
aliens are actually members


631
00:37:22.489 --> 00:37:23.623
of our families.

632
00:37:23.656 --> 00:37:28.093
One of the things that they
mean that's very important


633
00:37:28.126 --> 00:37:33.131
is it's a message that we
are not only here around you.


634
00:37:35.234 --> 00:37:37.002
We are in you too.

635
00:37:38.304 --> 00:37:43.141
This is not communication,
it's communion.


636
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.356
(mid tempo music)

637
00:38:11.638 --> 00:38:14.172
- [John] I was seven years old.

638
00:38:14.206 --> 00:38:17.277
What in God's name do they
want with me in particular?


639
00:38:19.512 --> 00:38:23.283
- I think they go to
the children first


640
00:38:23.316 --> 00:38:28.321
because the children are
too innocent not to be open


641
00:38:28.855 --> 00:38:31.089
to the possibility

642
00:38:31.123 --> 00:38:36.161
because they have to start
somewhere before the person


643
00:38:36.194 --> 00:38:38.264
is closed to the unknown.

644
00:38:39.666 --> 00:38:42.502
(mid tempo music)

645
00:38:44.737 --> 00:38:46.873
- [John] You're probably
not gonna like this section


646
00:38:46.906 --> 00:38:50.610
because it has a
lot to do with kids.


647
00:38:50.643 --> 00:38:53.880
And nobody likes when their
children are subjected to things


648
00:38:53.913 --> 00:38:58.851
that parents haven't signed
off on, let alone understand.


649
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.356
When someone interferes with
our children, it scares us.


650
00:39:04.324 --> 00:39:06.124
They're the future.

651
00:39:06.158 --> 00:39:10.263
They're our DNA, they're ours.

652
00:39:12.699 --> 00:39:14.667
Those facts have not
stopped this phenomena


653
00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:17.270
from interacting with kids.

654
00:39:17.303 --> 00:39:21.741
A lot of people are aware of
the 1994 incident in Zimbabwe


655
00:39:21.774 --> 00:39:22.809
when grade school

656
00:39:22.842 --> 00:39:25.745
through middle school
children saw a craft land


657
00:39:25.778 --> 00:39:28.146
just beyond their playground.

658
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.583
They all rushed out
there, saw a being,


659
00:39:30.617 --> 00:39:33.286
and received
telepathic messages.


660
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.255
You may be surprised to discover

661
00:39:36.289 --> 00:39:39.859
that this is not an
isolated incident.


662
00:39:41.294 --> 00:39:45.465
1989, Voronezh, Soviet Union,

663
00:39:45.498 --> 00:39:49.167
1978, Glasgow Scotland,

664
00:39:50.436 --> 00:39:54.741
1977, Wales UK,

665
00:39:54.774 --> 00:39:58.544
1977, Aberdeen Scotland.

666
00:39:59.946 --> 00:40:03.883
It's the same basic scenario
over and over again.


667
00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:07.253
Young children at recess,
walking to, or from school,


668
00:40:07.286 --> 00:40:12.325
a bright light, a silver
disc, images, a being.


669
00:40:14.761 --> 00:40:19.465
1967 Isle of Wight, UK,

670
00:40:19.499 --> 00:40:22.702
1967, Crestview, Florida,

671
00:40:22.735 --> 00:40:26.238
1966, Melbourne Australia,

672
00:40:27.006 --> 00:40:30.677
1952, Glasgow, Scotland,

673
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.778
a different school this time.

674
00:40:33.613 --> 00:40:36.416
And the conclusive proof
that our ET visitors believe


675
00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:39.819
that real men wear kilts,
the earliest record


676
00:40:39.852 --> 00:40:44.824
of a school sighting was

677
00:40:47.026 --> 00:40:49.862
The places, names and
times of day change,


678
00:40:49.896 --> 00:40:54.333
but the communication
is always the same.


679
00:40:54.367 --> 00:40:57.503
The puzzling thing is
that the messages conveyed


680
00:40:57.537 --> 00:41:00.640
or given to children that
would have absolutely no frame


681
00:41:00.673 --> 00:41:02.207
of reference to receive them.

682
00:41:04.577 --> 00:41:06.279
The earth is precious.

683
00:41:07.346 --> 00:41:08.548
You're hurting your planet.

684
00:41:09.415 --> 00:41:11.784
Cherish your home.

685
00:41:11.818 --> 00:41:13.419
People are precious.

686
00:41:14.287 --> 00:41:16.022
You're hurting each other.

687
00:41:16.055 --> 00:41:18.324
Cherish one another.

688
00:41:19.058 --> 00:41:21.394
We are all one.

689
00:41:23.863 --> 00:41:26.265
As you realize, from the
dates of these events,


690
00:41:26.299 --> 00:41:29.836
climate change wasn't really
on the tip of everyone's tongue


691
00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:30.703
at the time.

692
00:41:32.338 --> 00:41:34.874
It's as if ET were seeding
the children to be aware


693
00:41:34.907 --> 00:41:37.242
of our universal connectiveness.

694
00:41:38.044 --> 00:41:40.947
We are where we live
and what we consume


695
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.383
and they were preparing
them to engage this problem


696
00:41:44.417 --> 00:41:45.885
when they reached adulthood.

697
00:41:49.021 --> 00:41:51.324
- Is it still happening?

698
00:41:51.357 --> 00:41:55.828
If it is, it
remains very secret.


699
00:41:55.862 --> 00:42:00.366
This planet of ours is
changing now very rapidly


700
00:42:00.399 --> 00:42:03.369
and not in ways that are
going to be conducive


701
00:42:03.402 --> 00:42:08.407
to the continued safety of
anything on it, including us.


702
00:42:09.609 --> 00:42:11.077
And it may be that the
experience is changing


703
00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.613
with the planet.

704
00:42:13.646 --> 00:42:15.314
And if that's the case,

705
00:42:15.348 --> 00:42:20.353
there might not be any reason
anymore to educate children


706
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:24.490
in the way they were being
educated back in the '50s


707
00:42:24.524 --> 00:42:27.426
and '60s, and probably the '70s.

708
00:42:29.428 --> 00:42:33.065
- After I finally came to terms
with what had happened to me


709
00:42:33.099 --> 00:42:35.401
as a seven year old boy,

710
00:42:36.402 --> 00:42:39.605
I really started to
analyze the details.


711
00:42:39.639 --> 00:42:41.707
I didn't wanna miss anything.

712
00:42:41.741 --> 00:42:45.044
There was a part of this
memory that was totally blank


713
00:42:45.077 --> 00:42:46.445
for me and that bothered me.

714
00:42:46.479 --> 00:42:48.648
There was this huge
flash of light.


715
00:42:48.681 --> 00:42:51.617
And then I remember coming
back and outta the light.


716
00:42:51.651 --> 00:42:54.387
And I was standing opposite.

717
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.888
I didn't know what happened.

718
00:42:55.922 --> 00:42:59.458
And that piece, that missing
piece, it gnawed at me.


719
00:42:59.492 --> 00:43:02.695
It was this itch in
the back of my mind,


720
00:43:02.728 --> 00:43:05.431
like what happened,
what happened?


721
00:43:05.464 --> 00:43:08.634
And I had to know.

722
00:43:08.668 --> 00:43:09.635
I just had to know.

723
00:43:11.037 --> 00:43:15.441
And I found in that group
of people, direction,


724
00:43:15.474 --> 00:43:19.879
and they directed me to a
woman named Debz Shakti.


725
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.852
She had over 40 years experience
as a quantum hypnotherapist


726
00:43:25.885 --> 00:43:28.421
and her practice was
globally renowned.


727
00:43:28.454 --> 00:43:30.523
Debz's entire
approach was positive


728
00:43:30.556 --> 00:43:32.625
and she considered
it her life's purpose


729
00:43:32.658 --> 00:43:35.561
to help others awaken,
heal, and grow.


730
00:43:36.963 --> 00:43:39.732
Part of her practice was being
a lifelong yoga meditation


731
00:43:39.765 --> 00:43:42.468
and martial arts
and fitness teacher,


732
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:44.737
as well as a
respected open channel


733
00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:48.608
of a highly advanced ET
group known as The Teachers.


734
00:43:50.443 --> 00:43:53.646
Frankly, I didn't know what
to make of that last part,


735
00:43:53.679 --> 00:43:55.448
but who was I to talk?

736
00:43:55.481 --> 00:43:58.451
At seven years old, I had been
visited by a small silver man


737
00:43:58.484 --> 00:44:01.520
that looked like he stepped
out of a sci-fi TV show.


738
00:44:01.554 --> 00:44:04.724
What I can tell you is that
when I first spoke to her,


739
00:44:04.757 --> 00:44:07.526
it was just this
something about her,


740
00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.662
a genuine kindness
that I resonated with


741
00:44:09.695 --> 00:44:11.597
and her calm assurance

742
00:44:11.631 --> 00:44:14.767
that she could help me not
only reclaim my memories,


743
00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.169
but that with her guidance,

744
00:44:17.203 --> 00:44:20.406
I could also find peace with
the events of that night.


745
00:44:24.744 --> 00:44:27.914
(wind chimes chiming)

746
00:44:31.617 --> 00:44:34.186
(gentle music)

747
00:44:40.159 --> 00:44:41.827
- I'm Debz Shakti,

748
00:44:41.861 --> 00:44:44.997
I've been a professional
Hypnotherapist for many decades.


749
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:48.100
I specialized a
type of hypnotherapy


750
00:44:48.134 --> 00:44:52.571
that I call quantum
hypnotherapy about 40 years ago.


751
00:44:52.605 --> 00:44:55.608
I do channeling because I'm able

752
00:44:55.641 --> 00:45:00.513
to access the universal
stream of consciousness.


753
00:45:00.546 --> 00:45:05.518
I have had ET and
inter-dimensional contacts


754
00:45:06.519 --> 00:45:09.088
since I was first
able to remember.


755
00:45:10.523 --> 00:45:11.857
I was born in California,

756
00:45:13.025 --> 00:45:15.161
had a really cool little house.

757
00:45:18.764 --> 00:45:21.233
My brother and I were literally
called out into the forest.


758
00:45:21.268 --> 00:45:23.102
We thought there was a
forest fire in the middle


759
00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:27.073
of the night and
saw a huge craft.


760
00:45:29.575 --> 00:45:33.813
I know that we were put in
that craft and journeyed,


761
00:45:33.846 --> 00:45:37.016
but for me, all I
remember were the lights.


762
00:45:47.226 --> 00:45:49.662
The next day going
out in secret,


763
00:45:49.695 --> 00:45:52.665
'cause we weren't supposed to
have left the house at night,


764
00:45:52.698 --> 00:45:55.968
going back out in the forest
in the place where we saw it,


765
00:45:56.002 --> 00:45:58.904
there was a burnt
circle on the ground


766
00:45:58.938 --> 00:46:00.606
and it was very hot there.

767
00:46:06.012 --> 00:46:09.582
I've been a Yogi most of
my life and a Yoga Teacher.


768
00:46:09.615 --> 00:46:13.019
I have all the Claires,
Claire-sentience and all that,


769
00:46:13.052 --> 00:46:14.987
all the psychic gifts,

770
00:46:15.021 --> 00:46:18.758
which is very helpful
in counseling people


771
00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:20.793
from a global perspective.

772
00:46:22.262 --> 00:46:26.699
It used to be people coming
with simple human problems.


773
00:46:27.666 --> 00:46:29.135
How do I lose weight?

774
00:46:29.168 --> 00:46:30.870
How do I stop smoking?

775
00:46:30.903 --> 00:46:32.972
When do I find my true love?

776
00:46:33.005 --> 00:46:34.874
In the last couple of years,

777
00:46:34.907 --> 00:46:38.611
a lot of it has surrounded
the ET or paranormal


778
00:46:38.644 --> 00:46:39.912
if you wanna use that term,

779
00:46:39.945 --> 00:46:42.815
inter-dimensional
contact aspect.


780
00:46:42.848 --> 00:46:44.884
People who know they've
had an experience,


781
00:46:44.917 --> 00:46:46.786
but they can't put
it into the context


782
00:46:46.819 --> 00:46:48.321
of their own understanding,

783
00:46:48.355 --> 00:46:50.189
they want more information

784
00:46:50.222 --> 00:46:53.125
or they might even want more

785
00:46:53.159 --> 00:46:55.328
and they don't know
how to do that.


786
00:46:55.362 --> 00:46:59.698
It seems to have coalesced
over the last decade or so.


787
00:46:59.732 --> 00:47:04.003
And certainly in the last
few years to who am I?


788
00:47:04.036 --> 00:47:05.704
What am I here for?

789
00:47:05.738 --> 00:47:08.641
Can help me figure this all out.

790
00:47:14.747 --> 00:47:17.250
(eerie music)

791
00:47:30.229 --> 00:47:32.631
- So I often wonder why me?

792
00:47:32.665 --> 00:47:35.668
Why am I having
these experiences?


793
00:47:35.701 --> 00:47:37.770
Why aren't people believing me?

794
00:47:37.803 --> 00:47:39.306
I'm perfectly sound.

795
00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:43.242
It's just a natural thing that
a lot of people don't accept.


796
00:47:43.276 --> 00:47:45.678
- My family's
telling me I'm crazy.


797
00:47:45.711 --> 00:47:47.646
I'm wondering maybe I am crazy

798
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.849
'cause if everybody
tells you you're crazy,


799
00:47:49.882 --> 00:47:52.918
again, it's you
against the world


800
00:47:52.952 --> 00:47:55.721
and it's a frustrating
place to be.


801
00:47:55.754 --> 00:47:57.723
- I did not know
why they chose me.


802
00:47:57.756 --> 00:48:01.394
I do know once I realized
that this was a real thing


803
00:48:01.428 --> 00:48:03.863
that I wish that they hadn't.

804
00:48:19.412 --> 00:48:21.448
- I didn't know it
until many years later,


805
00:48:21.481 --> 00:48:24.850
but other family members
have had experiences.


806
00:48:24.884 --> 00:48:27.820
So I went kind of
all my life thinking


807
00:48:27.853 --> 00:48:30.956
that it was just a
dream and no more.


808
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.159
But then when I started
to share it with people,


809
00:48:33.192 --> 00:48:35.328
they started sharing
their experiences with me.


810
00:48:35.362 --> 00:48:37.029
So then I started to realize,

811
00:48:37.062 --> 00:48:39.266
this has to be more
than just a dream.


812
00:48:40.799 --> 00:48:44.236
- When I started researching,
what wasn't resonating


813
00:48:44.271 --> 00:48:48.174
with me was this
abduction, scary torture.


814
00:48:48.207 --> 00:48:51.411
It didn't logically
make sense to me.


815
00:48:51.444 --> 00:48:53.012
It was more of the message

816
00:48:53.045 --> 00:48:56.148
that the extraterrestrials
were delivering to us.


817
00:48:56.182 --> 00:48:58.251
That started resonating with me.

818
00:48:59.785 --> 00:49:02.021
- Why was I chosen?

819
00:49:02.054 --> 00:49:06.992
I made an agreement with these
beings before I incarnated


820
00:49:07.026 --> 00:49:09.161
into this physical form.

821
00:49:09.195 --> 00:49:12.399
The purpose isn't realized
until you get older,


822
00:49:12.432 --> 00:49:13.866
it will start to unfold.

823
00:49:22.775 --> 00:49:25.811
- What I'm talking about
here is a series of choices.


824
00:49:25.844 --> 00:49:30.849
Early on, I was chosen perhaps
at random to do something


825
00:49:31.518 --> 00:49:34.454
that cracked the cosmic egg.

826
00:49:34.487 --> 00:49:38.791
I went through a long experience
of noticing this presence


827
00:49:38.824 --> 00:49:43.829
in my childhood and
I made another choice
to engage with it.


828
00:49:45.332 --> 00:49:49.436
So I think it's a combination
of probably chance,


829
00:49:49.469 --> 00:49:54.474
their interest in an
individual, and choice.


830
00:49:55.908 --> 00:49:58.777
- I wondered all my life,
even while I was lying.


831
00:49:58.811 --> 00:50:00.179
I meant, why me?

832
00:50:00.212 --> 00:50:01.947
I mean, I'm an average guy.

833
00:50:02.815 --> 00:50:04.016
I was an average kid.

834
00:50:04.049 --> 00:50:05.285
It bothered me.

835
00:50:05.318 --> 00:50:09.422
Was I being blamed for
something or blessed?


836
00:50:10.889 --> 00:50:14.927
When I talked to Debz, I told
her that I desperately wanted


837
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.965
to find out these answers
because the bottom line


838
00:50:22.435 --> 00:50:24.036
is that she promised me peace

839
00:50:25.472 --> 00:50:28.941
and I really needed peace.

840
00:50:30.142 --> 00:50:32.144
- I'm confident that you're
going to get the answers


841
00:50:32.177 --> 00:50:33.480
that you came here for.

842
00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:37.550
And that you'll be
able to put your life


843
00:50:37.584 --> 00:50:41.554
in a different context after
today in a more positive light.


844
00:50:41.588 --> 00:50:46.959
This process, as you know
has you go in as an observer


845
00:50:48.227 --> 00:50:50.330
and when you are able to see
and perceive an experience


846
00:50:50.363 --> 00:50:54.434
from that place, it's a
completely different story.


847
00:50:55.868 --> 00:50:57.970
This tone will activate
your heart a little bit


848
00:50:58.003 --> 00:51:00.139
and I think you'll
feel good with it.


849
00:51:00.172 --> 00:51:02.141
So remember, you're
just breathing


850
00:51:02.174 --> 00:51:04.977
as you're chanting the mantra.

851
00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:07.614
You breathe at your own pace
and chant at your own pace.


852
00:51:07.647 --> 00:51:10.583
So it'll be a wave
between us, all right?


853
00:51:10.617 --> 00:51:11.451
So we'll begin.

854
00:51:15.954 --> 00:51:18.824
(Debz chanting)

855
00:51:28.668 --> 00:51:31.504
(mid tempo music)

856
00:51:46.252 --> 00:51:48.921
(eerie music)

857
00:51:56.028 --> 00:51:57.564
The key to falling
into the abyss


858
00:51:57.597 --> 00:51:59.432
and when you go
into the on known,


859
00:51:59.466 --> 00:52:01.601
you're not attached to the past,

860
00:52:01.634 --> 00:52:04.203
you're not making up the future,

861
00:52:04.236 --> 00:52:05.438
you're going into the unknown

862
00:52:05.472 --> 00:52:07.674
and that's where all
the magic happens


863
00:52:07.707 --> 00:52:11.511
because that's where
all potential exists.


864
00:52:11.544 --> 00:52:13.045
You have unlimited capability.

865
00:52:15.348 --> 00:52:17.950
- And don't ever let anyone
say that hypnosis doesn't work.


866
00:52:17.983 --> 00:52:20.487
It does work in the
hands of a real pro.


867
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.525
If you can get past the
barrier of compliance,


868
00:52:26.959 --> 00:52:31.264
you can sometimes evoke
memories that are buried.


869
00:52:32.131 --> 00:52:34.066
Memories are buried by trauma.

870
00:52:34.099 --> 00:52:38.003
How many people have you heard
who were in an auto accident


871
00:52:38.036 --> 00:52:40.607
or a plane crash or something,
and they'll tell you,


872
00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.175
"Well, I don't
remember a thing."


873
00:52:43.208 --> 00:52:44.577
But they do.

874
00:52:44.611 --> 00:52:49.114
Every instant of that
experience is locked in there.


875
00:52:50.617 --> 00:52:54.186
- [John] Quantum hypnosis
is a therapeutic modality


876
00:52:54.219 --> 00:52:56.556
conceived and developed
in the early 1980's


877
00:52:56.589 --> 00:53:00.326
by Debz Shakti based on the
quantum physics fundamental


878
00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.730
that everything is
intimately connected,


879
00:53:03.763 --> 00:53:08.066
occurring
simultaneously forever.


880
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.702
An easier way to think of this

881
00:53:09.736 --> 00:53:13.005
is that popularized
hypnosis allows one


882
00:53:13.038 --> 00:53:16.743
to access experiences that
they personally have witnessed


883
00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:17.610
in the flesh.

884
00:53:17.644 --> 00:53:21.079
Whereas quantum
hypnosis allows one


885
00:53:21.113 --> 00:53:25.418
to access experiences
anywhere from any perspective


886
00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:27.287
in the universe.

887
00:53:28.555 --> 00:53:30.457
- People have experiences,

888
00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:33.125
but they're told lies
about those experiences


889
00:53:33.158 --> 00:53:35.428
so they don't talk about 'em.

890
00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:37.129
Debz has helped me a lot.

891
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:41.301
She's helped me overcome
some of my fears.


892
00:53:42.802 --> 00:53:46.473
She's helped me at least to
get started on that right path


893
00:53:46.506 --> 00:53:49.275
of discovering myself.

894
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:51.744
Finally, I can
breathe a sigh relief.


895
00:53:51.778 --> 00:53:55.782
I don't have that pressure
built up inside of me anymore.


896
00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:58.318
- No matter how
often people protest


897
00:53:58.351 --> 00:53:59.786
that they can't be hypnotized.

898
00:53:59.819 --> 00:54:02.489
I always laugh and
say, "We'll see."


899
00:54:02.522 --> 00:54:06.259
- I realize maybe that'll take
me back to the fast dreams.


900
00:54:06.292 --> 00:54:09.529
You're viewing consciousness
flashing before your eyes.


901
00:54:09.562 --> 00:54:11.764
You can't slow yourself down.

902
00:54:11.798 --> 00:54:14.767
And that silver cord
could be connected


903
00:54:14.801 --> 00:54:18.237
to the silver cord that connects
our souls to our bodies.


904
00:54:18.271 --> 00:54:22.140
And the message was I
have to learn to trust


905
00:54:22.174 --> 00:54:24.142
that where I am right
now in this process


906
00:54:24.176 --> 00:54:26.312
is the perfect
place for me to be.


907
00:54:26.346 --> 00:54:29.047
And as soon as I
start to trust that,


908
00:54:29.081 --> 00:54:30.148
amazing doors will open.

909
00:54:32.785 --> 00:54:36.456
- [John] Sigmund Freud
coined the term screen memory


910
00:54:36.489 --> 00:54:38.056
when he examined some

911
00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:41.528
of the most vivid visual
memories deriving from childhood


912
00:54:41.561 --> 00:54:43.095
in his patients.

913
00:54:44.397 --> 00:54:47.800
He came to realize that
these distorted recollections


914
00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:49.836
were constructs that
the mind would create


915
00:54:49.869 --> 00:54:51.538
to insulate the person

916
00:54:51.571 --> 00:54:55.173
from some childhood
psychological trauma.


917
00:54:55.207 --> 00:54:58.243
Ultraman was my screen memory

918
00:54:58.278 --> 00:54:59.746
that shielded me from something

919
00:54:59.779 --> 00:55:03.483
that my terrified
seven year old mind


920
00:55:03.516 --> 00:55:07.387
just could not process.

921
00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.657
What happened to me as a boy
was not only frightening,


922
00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:14.827
it was so unbelievable that
I lied to myself about it


923
00:55:14.861 --> 00:55:19.365
for almost 45 years so I would
not have to face the event,


924
00:55:20.567 --> 00:55:24.537
the sneering world,
or my darkest fears


925
00:55:24.571 --> 00:55:27.105
that it actually did happen.

926
00:55:29.776 --> 00:55:32.210
- Are you gonna break
through the screen memory?


927
00:55:32.244 --> 00:55:34.347
Can you bear it after all?

928
00:55:35.548 --> 00:55:38.183
Are you going to decide
instead, wait a minute,


929
00:55:38.216 --> 00:55:40.520
something was going on.

930
00:55:40.553 --> 00:55:42.120
What was it?

931
00:55:42.154 --> 00:55:43.623
I wanna know.

932
00:55:43.656 --> 00:55:46.326
That's when you start
to engage in contact.


933
00:55:51.196 --> 00:55:53.700
(eerie music)

934
00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:00.840
- When I started this hypnosis,

935
00:56:00.873 --> 00:56:03.175
I have to tell you I was afraid.

936
00:56:04.277 --> 00:56:05.812
I was nervous
about what I'd say.


937
00:56:05.845 --> 00:56:08.748
I was nervous about how
it would be handled.


938
00:56:08.781 --> 00:56:11.584
I trusted Debz
enough to go under.


939
00:56:13.218 --> 00:56:15.655
- Let the body just rest there.

940
00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:21.894
So be open and allow
everything to flow.


941
00:56:21.928 --> 00:56:24.196
I wanted to be gentle with him

942
00:56:24.229 --> 00:56:27.533
because he was a person
who had a lot of fear


943
00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:30.336
and was already very vulnerable.

944
00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:35.375
What I'd like for you to
do now is to take yourself


945
00:56:36.542 --> 00:56:39.177
if you like to the
place where you were


946
00:56:39.211 --> 00:56:42.548
that seven year old John.

947
00:56:42.582 --> 00:56:44.517
You're in the bathroom,

948
00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.185
you're standing in
front of the sink.


949
00:56:47.219 --> 00:56:49.389
Can you go there
now for me please?


950
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:51.824
- [John] I can hear the water.

951
00:56:51.858 --> 00:56:53.225
I see the light
underneath the door.


952
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:55.895
I turn the water off.

953
00:56:57.397 --> 00:56:59.365
I don't wanna go out yet.

954
00:56:59.399 --> 00:57:01.901
- Describe what
happens as you go.


955
00:57:01.934 --> 00:57:02.869
The more he described,

956
00:57:02.902 --> 00:57:06.238
the deeper he went and
the deeper he went,


957
00:57:06.272 --> 00:57:08.741
the better he was
able to journey.


958
00:57:08.775 --> 00:57:09.942
- I opened that door.

959
00:57:09.976 --> 00:57:12.745
I had seen Ultraman
a thousand times.


960
00:57:12.779 --> 00:57:14.380
I had seen him in my dreams.

961
00:57:14.414 --> 00:57:16.516
I knew for sure that
that's what it was.


962
00:57:25.258 --> 00:57:28.361
- And there were times
where it got very emotional.


963
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:33.700
(John sobs)

964
00:57:33.733 --> 00:57:34.867
You're safe, John.

965
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:36.736
It's okay, it's safe.

966
00:57:36.769 --> 00:57:37.937
- There's somebody there.

967
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:42.575
- [Debz] Someone's there,
remember, objective observation,


968
00:57:42.608 --> 00:57:43.609
report to me.

969
00:57:43.643 --> 00:57:45.611
- [John] There's a man there.

970
00:57:45.645 --> 00:57:47.313
- [Debz] There's a man there.

971
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:50.550
- And he looks like an ant.

972
00:57:55.354 --> 00:57:58.991
And this dark ant-like
creature, he came at me


973
00:58:00.326 --> 00:58:01.728
and I fought for my life.

974
00:58:01.761 --> 00:58:06.265
But he doesn't have
antenna like a normal ant.


975
00:58:06.299 --> 00:58:11.304
He has like antlers and he
has them on top of his head


976
00:58:12.472 --> 00:58:15.775
and he has them out of
the sides of his cheeks.


977
00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:18.511
- And it was fascinating,
but it was so hard


978
00:58:18.544 --> 00:58:22.315
because he was
absolutely uncomfortable.


979
00:58:22.348 --> 00:58:23.783
That must look really different

980
00:58:23.816 --> 00:58:25.952
from anything you've
ever seen before.


981
00:58:27.353 --> 00:58:29.422
- [John] He's trying to
use those antlers on me.


982
00:58:30.056 --> 00:58:31.758
- [Debz] How so?

983
00:58:31.791 --> 00:58:36.429
- He's pushing things out
of his antlers like energy


984
00:58:36.462 --> 00:58:39.031
or thoughts or something.

985
00:58:39.065 --> 00:58:41.434
Yeah, he is trying to
push me out so I'll go


986
00:58:41.467 --> 00:58:46.472
and I'm not going, no, no.

987
00:58:48.107 --> 00:58:52.645
I recognize him and I thought,

988
00:58:52.678 --> 00:58:54.413
"Oh, I know what
you're here for.


989
00:58:55.648 --> 00:58:57.316
"You're gonna take me."

990
00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:58.518
He doesn't care about me.

991
00:58:58.551 --> 00:59:00.019
He doesn't care.

992
00:59:00.052 --> 00:59:01.255
- [Debz] He's not
an empathic being


993
00:59:01.287 --> 00:59:04.724
like you are, he's different.
- [John] He's not, he's not.


994
00:59:04.757 --> 00:59:06.592
- He was so brave

995
00:59:06.626 --> 00:59:09.428
because everything there
was terrifying to him.


996
00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:12.064
- Oh, this has happened before.

997
00:59:12.098 --> 00:59:16.969
And now I know that
I have no choice.


998
00:59:17.003 --> 00:59:18.771
Everything came back to me.

999
00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:22.108
I remembered previous occasions
when he had come for me


1000
00:59:22.141 --> 00:59:24.110
and I had fought him then.

1001
00:59:24.143 --> 00:59:26.879
- [Debz] Where does he
want you to go, John?


1002
00:59:26.913 --> 00:59:30.116
- I'm moving towards him

1003
00:59:30.149 --> 00:59:34.420
and I can feel the temperature
change in the hallway.


1004
00:59:34.453 --> 00:59:35.888
There was a flash.

1005
00:59:37.156 --> 00:59:38.891
And then we were gone.

1006
00:59:38.925 --> 00:59:42.428
It felt like heat that
came up from the floor


1007
00:59:42.461 --> 00:59:45.097
And it just kind of
pushed me back like this.


1008
00:59:45.131 --> 00:59:49.368
- He just tapped into different
scenes of his experience


1009
00:59:49.402 --> 00:59:52.471
and it disturbed him greatly.

1010
00:59:52.505 --> 00:59:54.473
- And the next thing I know,

1011
00:59:56.542 --> 00:59:58.377
I'm in this cavern

1012
01:00:02.715 --> 01:00:06.352
and I knew I'd been here before.

1013
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.423
- [Debz] Let's move forward
to where you go then.


1014
01:00:10.456 --> 01:00:11.390
Go there now.

1015
01:00:12.491 --> 01:00:14.360
- [John] This place is immense.

1016
01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:17.563
- [Debz] Huge.
- [John] It's huge.


1017
01:00:17.597 --> 01:00:21.801
I mean, I could scream
and it would echo.


1018
01:00:21.834 --> 01:00:23.536
- [Debz] You're in a huge place.

1019
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.405
Bring it into focus.

1020
01:00:26.439 --> 01:00:29.775
- There's a big
opening at the top.


1021
01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:32.478
It looks natural.

1022
01:00:32.511 --> 01:00:35.181
It looks like it's like a cave.

1023
01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:40.419
There are stalactites, things
hanging down from the edges


1024
01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:43.189
of that hole.
- All right.


1025
01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:45.925
- And there's a very
bright light up there.


1026
01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:47.560
- [Debz] Oh.
- [John] And it's dark.


1027
01:00:47.593 --> 01:00:49.395
It's very dark in here.

1028
01:00:50.463 --> 01:00:51.898
- Safety and peace.

1029
01:00:53.466 --> 01:00:55.968
What do you do here
when you're here John?


1030
01:00:56.002 --> 01:00:57.436
- I don't know where
they come from,


1031
01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:01.540
but there are these
screens, these big screens


1032
01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:07.880
and they show you
stuff very fast.


1033
01:01:10.049 --> 01:01:14.487
I tried to move, but they
had some sort of hold on me


1034
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.057
when I would be forced to
see these three huge screens.


1035
01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:20.993
So you see the pictures.

1036
01:01:21.027 --> 01:01:24.764
They're the same picture
that make up a big picture.


1037
01:01:24.797 --> 01:01:28.501
And they move from
my right to my left.


1038
01:01:30.803 --> 01:01:32.471
- Are they speaking with you?

1039
01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:34.440
- They don't talk.

1040
01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:39.645
They use those little picture
in your head or something.


1041
01:01:41.013 --> 01:01:42.248
They're different though.

1042
01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.517
They're different
than the ant guy.


1043
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:45.952
He's their bully.

1044
01:01:45.985 --> 01:01:47.053
He doesn't care.

1045
01:01:47.086 --> 01:01:48.888
- They're indifferent.

1046
01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:51.023
- Don't care, don't care.

1047
01:01:51.057 --> 01:01:52.858
- They just have a job to do.

1048
01:01:52.892 --> 01:01:54.226
When you were telling me

1049
01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:56.629
that story before you said
there were lots of lights


1050
01:01:56.662 --> 01:01:58.831
like a carousel
or a kaleidoscope,


1051
01:02:00.032 --> 01:02:01.901
is this what you were seeing?

1052
01:02:01.934 --> 01:02:05.071
These fast moving
pictures, making light?


1053
01:02:06.273 --> 01:02:10.643
- It was like I was looking out
of a train moving very fast.


1054
01:02:13.579 --> 01:02:15.548
But the message is
in between the lines,


1055
01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:19.785
is in between them, is
inside, is inside, is inside.


1056
01:02:22.255 --> 01:02:23.556
- And when we got

1057
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:28.761
to where it felt like
it couldn't get any
more information,


1058
01:02:29.929 --> 01:02:32.698
I asked permission to
talk to his higher-self,


1059
01:02:32.732 --> 01:02:36.535
to that grand wisdom that is
so zoomed out from everything,


1060
01:02:36.569 --> 01:02:39.272
it can see all of the
experiences at once


1061
01:02:39.306 --> 01:02:43.509
and bring it into kind of a
more coherent explanation.


1062
01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:48.814
- But it was almost like
somebody was right behind me


1063
01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:50.649
and I could feel their presence.

1064
01:02:51.584 --> 01:02:52.785
It was like a force.

1065
01:02:52.818 --> 01:02:55.688
And my mouth opened up and I
didn't know what I was saying.


1066
01:02:57.156 --> 01:02:59.658
- May I address your
higher-self right now?


1067
01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.695
The one who knows everything.

1068
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:05.231
Yes?

1069
01:03:05.265 --> 01:03:06.832
Thank you so much.

1070
01:03:08.268 --> 01:03:12.305
And the voice that came out
was a whole different John


1071
01:03:12.339 --> 01:03:14.006
that I had ever seen before.

1072
01:03:16.642 --> 01:03:17.877
- The boy is prepared.

1073
01:03:19.645 --> 01:03:20.546
He must be strong.

1074
01:03:21.614 --> 01:03:22.548
There is a plan.

1075
01:03:24.016 --> 01:03:25.184
It will occur.

1076
01:03:25.217 --> 01:03:26.185
- It will occur.

1077
01:03:28.154 --> 01:03:29.356
- And he will be prepared.

1078
01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:31.291
- And he is prepared.

1079
01:03:31.324 --> 01:03:33.059
And I said, "Prepared for what?"

1080
01:03:33.092 --> 01:03:37.696
And they said, "For what's
to come next, the plan."


1081
01:03:38.864 --> 01:03:42.335
And then suddenly he
just set up his eyes open


1082
01:03:42.369 --> 01:03:46.739
and he had this laser
beam, eye contact with me.


1083
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.585
You're back.
- Yeah.


1084
01:04:00.686 --> 01:04:03.155
- He said, "It's completed."

1085
01:04:03.189 --> 01:04:05.958
And then started
spewing forth all


1086
01:04:05.991 --> 01:04:09.128
of this incredible wisdom.

1087
01:04:10.663 --> 01:04:15.167
- And that is why they
can't take me anymore.


1088
01:04:15.201 --> 01:04:18.637
It's because it's
no longer necessary.


1089
01:04:18.671 --> 01:04:22.241
The point was to get
me strong enough.


1090
01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:27.280
It's interesting because to me
now, it makes perfect sense.


1091
01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:30.182
Oh my God, I can't tell you
how clear that is to me.


1092
01:04:30.216 --> 01:04:31.684
The pictures didn't matter.

1093
01:04:31.717 --> 01:04:35.221
The message was actually
in the smaller fragments


1094
01:04:35.255 --> 01:04:37.290
and the lines between,

1095
01:04:37.324 --> 01:04:40.427
but the message, the
information was coming through.


1096
01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.627
- He has a purpose.

1097
01:04:43.062 --> 01:04:47.733
There is a plan and he
needs to get to work.


1098
01:04:49.702 --> 01:04:53.072
- There is a war for our souls,

1099
01:04:53.105 --> 01:04:56.075
not in the conventional sense,

1100
01:04:56.108 --> 01:05:00.713
but service to self,
service to others.


1101
01:05:01.847 --> 01:05:05.385
- He described what
it's all about,


1102
01:05:05.418 --> 01:05:09.422
kind of a preparation
speech for what's to come,


1103
01:05:09.456 --> 01:05:12.459
not just for him,
but for humanity.


1104
01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:15.362
- No one will escape its touch.

1105
01:05:15.395 --> 01:05:18.764
I know and I know it's
within my lifetime.


1106
01:05:18.797 --> 01:05:20.333
This is what my purpose is.

1107
01:05:22.469 --> 01:05:26.038
When I went under,
everything clarified


1108
01:05:26.071 --> 01:05:28.240
and I experienced
something very real.


1109
01:05:28.275 --> 01:05:30.477
I was taken somewhere
and I found out


1110
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.045
that I had experienced
it several times before.


1111
01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:39.151
There's something coming and
it's gonna affect every person


1112
01:05:41.153 --> 01:05:42.988
on the planet.

1113
01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:46.025
These encounters
that I had as a child


1114
01:05:46.058 --> 01:05:48.761
have been conditioning me.

1115
01:05:48.794 --> 01:05:53.799
I knew that there was a
conflict for the soul of man,


1116
01:05:54.467 --> 01:05:56.235
that we are at a crossroads

1117
01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:02.174
and it would be easy
to destroy ourselves.


1118
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:04.743
It's going to be scary.

1119
01:06:04.777 --> 01:06:05.744
It's gonna be wonderful.

1120
01:06:05.778 --> 01:06:07.046
It's gonna be terrible.

1121
01:06:07.079 --> 01:06:09.282
It's going to be
all of these things.


1122
01:06:09.316 --> 01:06:13.353
The message I got was be ready.

1123
01:06:14.521 --> 01:06:17.890
The world is asleep, be ready.

1124
01:06:29.502 --> 01:06:30.370
- [Pilot] There's a
whole fleet of them,


1125
01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:32.071
look on my ASA, my Gosh!

1126
01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.907
- [Reporter] Tonight, the
highly anticipated report


1127
01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.444
on unexplained aerial
phenomena is here,


1128
01:06:37.477 --> 01:06:39.111
but the answers are not.

1129
01:06:39.144 --> 01:06:43.816
- 144 separate sightings of
UFOs by the U.S. military,


1130
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:47.820
the other 143 remain a
complete and total mystery.


1131
01:06:47.853 --> 01:06:49.522
- [Reporter] Over a
dozen of those reports


1132
01:06:49.556 --> 01:06:53.326
include observations of
unusual movement patterns,


1133
01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.528
or flight, and they
can't explain those.


1134
01:06:55.562 --> 01:06:58.531
- So the most sophisticated
military in the world


1135
01:06:58.565 --> 01:07:00.199
has no idea what
these things are


1136
01:07:00.232 --> 01:07:02.369
or even how they move
from place to place.


1137
01:07:02.402 --> 01:07:05.137
- Yeah, ETs are coming here or
however they wanna define it.


1138
01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:07.172
The second question
is going to be,


1139
01:07:07.206 --> 01:07:08.841
how the hell did they get here?

1140
01:07:08.874 --> 01:07:13.480
- We have in the Pentagon a
whole lot more of those videos.


1141
01:07:14.347 --> 01:07:15.247
And if you think the quality

1142
01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:17.182
of the ones you've seen is good,

1143
01:07:17.216 --> 01:07:18.784
you ain't seen nothing yet.

1144
01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.422
- [John] The way
that the military


1145
01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:25.190
has covered up UFO
sightings is legend.


1146
01:07:25.224 --> 01:07:26.593
- The government had
an official policy


1147
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.994
where they would deny
that what they people saw,


1148
01:07:29.028 --> 01:07:32.599
they would try to create
ridicule around this.


1149
01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:36.469
This is proven through
declassified documents.


1150
01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:45.077
- [John] Since Roswell,
they're never ending litany


1151
01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:48.947
of weak excuses like
weather balloons


1152
01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:51.216
that move over 600
miles per hour,


1153
01:07:51.251 --> 01:07:55.888
swamp gas that leave circular
burn marks and radioactivity


1154
01:07:55.921 --> 01:07:59.392
on the ground, and
atmospheric inversions


1155
01:07:59.426 --> 01:08:02.161
that can evade fighter jets

1156
01:08:02.194 --> 01:08:05.898
have sated skeptics and
frustrated genuine investigators


1157
01:08:05.931 --> 01:08:07.866
for the better part
of a century now.


1158
01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:11.937
Even with the latest disclosures
in the "New York Times"


1159
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:14.341
of sightings of a
now famous TIC TAC,


1160
01:08:14.374 --> 01:08:19.078
we find that that information
has been hidden since 2004.


1161
01:08:19.111 --> 01:08:23.350
The bottom line is those
guys don't want us to know


1162
01:08:23.383 --> 01:08:24.917
what's going on.

1163
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:26.386
And they've done
everything in their power


1164
01:08:26.419 --> 01:08:30.423
to sidestep, obfuscate,
and outright troll anybody


1165
01:08:30.457 --> 01:08:32.325
that has come forward
with the truth.


1166
01:08:33.393 --> 01:08:34.594
- And this newly released pile

1167
01:08:34.627 --> 01:08:37.630
of records like the
page you see now,


1168
01:08:37.664 --> 01:08:40.500
four words on the entire
page were readable


1169
01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.835
and not blacked-out.

1170
01:08:41.867 --> 01:08:45.605
And there are hundreds
and hundreds of
pages just like that.


1171
01:08:45.638 --> 01:08:47.106
- Regular people
on the other hand


1172
01:08:47.139 --> 01:08:50.310
have from the very
beginning matter-of-factly,


1173
01:08:50.343 --> 01:08:52.645
reported these occurrences.

1174
01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:55.180
And in general, they
were communicated


1175
01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.617
by the media by-and-large,

1176
01:08:57.650 --> 01:09:02.589
fairly throughout the
'40s, '50s, and '60s.


1177
01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:04.990
- I've been giving
you details on the UFO


1178
01:09:05.023 --> 01:09:06.459
that hung over Redmond, Oregon

1179
01:09:06.493 --> 01:09:09.362
for at least two hours early
this September morning.


1180
01:09:09.396 --> 01:09:11.664
- [John] Hell, in response
to the public's interest


1181
01:09:11.698 --> 01:09:13.966
and concern, the
House Minority Leader


1182
01:09:13.999 --> 01:09:18.338
at the time, Gerald
Ford demanded a
full-blown investigation


1183
01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:22.275
by the house armed
services committee in 1966.


1184
01:09:22.308 --> 01:09:26.044
And in 1969, the sitting
governor of Georgia,


1185
01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:29.047
Jimmy Carter felt
comfortable enough


1186
01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:32.050
to file a UFO report.

1187
01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:34.687
It all changed later
that year in December.


1188
01:09:35.988 --> 01:09:38.558
Armed with the dismissive
"Condon Report"


1189
01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:43.061
and the inconclusive end
to "Project Blue Book",


1190
01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.731
there was a sea change.

1191
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.567
- But "Blue Book" is now closed,

1192
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.968
but reports are
still being made.


1193
01:09:50.002 --> 01:09:52.037
So under whose command

1194
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:53.972
and where are they
being forwarded to?


1195
01:09:55.174 --> 01:09:57.009
- [John] The ones that were
reported only showed up


1196
01:09:57.042 --> 01:10:00.713
on the cover of tabloids
or the punchlines


1197
01:10:00.747 --> 01:10:03.583
of late night hosts
conversations.


1198
01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:05.418
- Did you know there
are UFOs out here,


1199
01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:08.987
flying around unidentified?
(audience cheer)


1200
01:10:09.021 --> 01:10:11.056
- This would be the place
for 'em, Southern California.


1201
01:10:11.089 --> 01:10:12.325
(audience laugh)

1202
01:10:12.358 --> 01:10:14.761
- [John] People wanted to keep
their jobs and their position


1203
01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:19.131
in society without the
uncomfortable snickers


1204
01:10:19.164 --> 01:10:20.767
and jibes behind their backs

1205
01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.571
about where their
tin foil hats were.


1206
01:10:24.604 --> 01:10:27.206
Here's a question to
those watching this film.


1207
01:10:28.608 --> 01:10:31.544
If the establishment has spent
all this money and effort


1208
01:10:31.578 --> 01:10:35.080
to hide and discredit
UFO sightings,


1209
01:10:35.113 --> 01:10:38.050
which are pretty
innocuous in themselves,


1210
01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:43.055
to what ends with the powers
that be go to hide something


1211
01:10:44.223 --> 01:10:47.993
as mind blowing as alien
interaction with their citizens?


1212
01:10:49.429 --> 01:10:53.098
The good news is that there are
more people asking questions


1213
01:10:53.131 --> 01:10:55.335
and demanding answers
now about this subject


1214
01:10:55.368 --> 01:10:56.503
than ever before.

1215
01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:01.106
- From the believers who
think the aliens are here


1216
01:11:01.139 --> 01:11:03.543
to the hardcore skeptics who
spend whole time debunking


1217
01:11:03.576 --> 01:11:05.143
that stuff, they think it's good

1218
01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:07.079
that we're finally
having this conversation.


1219
01:11:07.112 --> 01:11:08.581
- They're saying we need
to get on-board on this.


1220
01:11:08.615 --> 01:11:10.483
It's finally time
to figure it out.


1221
01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.552
That's a major
shift in attitude.


1222
01:11:12.585 --> 01:11:15.421
- There's a lot of pressure
by the global public


1223
01:11:15.455 --> 01:11:18.223
and the American
public for answers.


1224
01:11:18.258 --> 01:11:22.060
- Let's take this subject
out of the shadows


1225
01:11:22.094 --> 01:11:24.797
and put it where it
belongs in the spotlight.


1226
01:11:32.438 --> 01:11:36.108
- Well, at this point in John's
progression through the work


1227
01:11:36.141 --> 01:11:37.075
that we were doing,

1228
01:11:37.109 --> 01:11:41.146
I realized that he was
on a continual quest


1229
01:11:41.179 --> 01:11:43.383
for understanding and
meaning of the experiences


1230
01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:46.184
that he had gone through
and still undergoes.


1231
01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:49.255
And I realized it was time that
maybe he should meet someone


1232
01:11:49.289 --> 01:11:52.358
who had similar
experiences in his life


1233
01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:54.527
and who had been
documenting them.


1234
01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:57.597
And more than anybody on
the planet understands this


1235
01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:59.332
in the same way.

1236
01:11:59.365 --> 01:12:01.568
And that person is
Whitley Strieber.


1237
01:12:05.271 --> 01:12:07.774
(eerie music)

1238
01:12:15.147 --> 01:12:16.883
- Whitley has written more

1239
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.885
on this subject
than anybody else.


1240
01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:24.122
And he has a way of sharing
first person, his reactions,


1241
01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:32.865
and also just being
completely, raw, truthful


1242
01:12:34.199 --> 01:12:35.835
with the facts.

1243
01:12:35.868 --> 01:12:40.873
He truly is the harbinger of
this information to the world.


1244
01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:00.727
- I've never thought of
myself as being on a mission.


1245
01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:09.167
I'm very interested
in understanding
the world around us


1246
01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:12.672
and I'm very interested
in the welfare of mankind.


1247
01:13:12.705 --> 01:13:15.508
And I think this is
a great big universe.


1248
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:18.911
And I just sense that
what's here is very unique


1249
01:13:18.945 --> 01:13:21.381
and very beautiful
and extraordinary.


1250
01:13:22.548 --> 01:13:26.218
What is the destiny
of the human soul?


1251
01:13:26.252 --> 01:13:30.222
The visitors have taught
me that living out of love,


1252
01:13:30.256 --> 01:13:33.191
compassion and
humility are essential


1253
01:13:33.225 --> 01:13:35.294
to building a strong soul.

1254
01:13:36.529 --> 01:13:41.233
And my question is always,
what does love really mean?


1255
01:13:41.968 --> 01:13:44.470
Where is that feeling in myself

1256
01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:48.608
and how do I see it in others
and in the world around me?


1257
01:13:49.776 --> 01:13:54.347
Compassion, how do I
not forget to find it


1258
01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.616
when someone makes me angry?

1259
01:13:58.251 --> 01:14:02.822
Humility, without humility
we're not fully human.


1260
01:14:03.923 --> 01:14:07.960
We have to be humble,
but in the end,


1261
01:14:07.994 --> 01:14:11.831
every single one of us
is exactly the same.


1262
01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:16.769
We are all equal,
profoundly equal.


1263
01:14:16.803 --> 01:14:21.808
My love of mankind and of
this planet is my mission.


1264
01:14:24.277 --> 01:14:29.282
There is a peace beyond
this life that we will find


1265
01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:32.452
and we will taste.

1266
01:14:32.485 --> 01:14:33.686
And these people

1267
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:37.423
who are on this mission
are all on the mission


1268
01:14:37.457 --> 01:14:38.458
for the same reason.

1269
01:14:42.762 --> 01:14:46.733
- If I could go back and
tell my 12 year old self


1270
01:14:46.766 --> 01:14:51.270
what I know now, I would
tell her it's gonna be okay,


1271
01:14:51.304 --> 01:14:52.538
that I'm not going crazy,

1272
01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:55.441
that these experiences are real.

1273
01:14:55.475 --> 01:14:56.943
You're not alone.

1274
01:14:56.976 --> 01:14:58.277
We're not alone.

1275
01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.714
- I floated up toward him.

1276
01:15:01.748 --> 01:15:03.382
He was no longer
the popcorn man.


1277
01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:07.286
He was just light and I was
just light and we merged.


1278
01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.689
I got a download, we are one.

1279
01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:11.858
It was the most intense
love I can describe.


1280
01:15:11.891 --> 01:15:14.494
I never felt love
like that before.


1281
01:15:14.527 --> 01:15:17.330
The answer is that we
need to grow spiritually.


1282
01:15:17.363 --> 01:15:19.031
We need to realize
that we really are one


1283
01:15:19.065 --> 01:15:21.534
because what we
do to the planet,


1284
01:15:21.567 --> 01:15:22.835
what we do to someone else

1285
01:15:22.869 --> 01:15:24.871
is actually we're
doing it to ourselves.


1286
01:15:26.038 --> 01:15:28.341
- This is the start of
an awakening for me.


1287
01:15:29.742 --> 01:15:32.411
These are genuine experiences

1288
01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.514
and they're nothing
to be afraid of.


1289
01:15:34.547 --> 01:15:37.016
It's opened up new
relationships for me.


1290
01:15:37.049 --> 01:15:40.353
It's made me closer
to people that I love.


1291
01:15:40.386 --> 01:15:43.356
They're here
primarily to help us.


1292
01:15:44.657 --> 01:15:47.560
- All my experiences
led me to the belief


1293
01:15:47.593 --> 01:15:52.365
that I was protected and that
these were loving experiences.


1294
01:15:52.398 --> 01:15:55.501
I volunteered to come
here for a mission.


1295
01:15:55.535 --> 01:15:58.905
And that was to use my
knowledge and ability


1296
01:15:58.938 --> 01:16:03.509
to try to raise awareness
and help heal the world.


1297
01:16:04.844 --> 01:16:08.681
- I'm starting to pay
attention to life, to nature.


1298
01:16:08.714 --> 01:16:10.716
There was this one
night I walked out


1299
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:13.386
to a huge explosion of light.

1300
01:16:13.419 --> 01:16:17.390
It was almost like a dance
and I was just blown away.


1301
01:16:17.423 --> 01:16:20.126
It's changed me to
such a great degree


1302
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:22.361
in terms of my
level of compassion,


1303
01:16:22.395 --> 01:16:26.432
compassion towards humans,
towards our planet.


1304
01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:53.459
- My relationship has
changed to this phenomena.


1305
01:16:53.492 --> 01:16:54.527
We're all one energy.

1306
01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.461
We're one source.

1307
01:16:55.494 --> 01:16:56.963
We're all aspects of God.

1308
01:16:56.996 --> 01:16:59.665
And that includes the
plant kingdom, the animals,


1309
01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:02.168
the humans, our
star being friends.


1310
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:04.604
It's all from the
same spark of light.


1311
01:17:04.637 --> 01:17:08.174
When we all realize that
we have the capability


1312
01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:12.178
of working intuitively and
expanding our consciousness,


1313
01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:14.046
that's gonna change the world

1314
01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.449
and we can live a
very prosperous,


1315
01:17:16.482 --> 01:17:19.485
loving heart-centered
experience.


1316
01:17:19.518 --> 01:17:22.088
It makes me cry, it's
really beautiful.


1317
01:17:24.523 --> 01:17:27.560
- My biggest hope, my biggest
wish, my biggest prayer


1318
01:17:27.593 --> 01:17:31.497
is that the world
come into coherence,


1319
01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:36.168
that we end the separate,
dualistic nature of our species.


1320
01:17:36.202 --> 01:17:39.138
Everyone is connected
to everyone.


1321
01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:42.608
When we can see things from
that global zoomed out view


1322
01:17:42.642 --> 01:17:44.710
that our star friends see us,

1323
01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:46.812
there's no denying
what we have to do.


1324
01:17:46.846 --> 01:17:49.048
We have to become
peaceful, harmonious.


1325
01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.083
We need to learn
to work together.


1326
01:17:51.117 --> 01:17:53.486
We're all connected
on some level.


1327
01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:59.125
- When people watch television
or they see shiny lights


1328
01:17:59.158 --> 01:18:02.628
in the sky, that's one
thing and it's fascinating


1329
01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:05.531
and you can discuss
it over coffee,


1330
01:18:06.799 --> 01:18:10.503
but if you're met face-to-face
with something so alien


1331
01:18:12.071 --> 01:18:17.076
as an intelligence from
another planet or dimension,


1332
01:18:18.844 --> 01:18:20.546
that will change you.

1333
01:18:23.115 --> 01:18:24.083
It changed me.

1334
01:18:25.217 --> 01:18:28.487
I can look at those things
through the eyes of a man


1335
01:18:28.521 --> 01:18:30.156
and realize they're
not to be feared,


1336
01:18:31.724 --> 01:18:34.493
but they must be dealt with.

1337
01:18:36.529 --> 01:18:39.198
- We are all on a journey.

1338
01:18:39.231 --> 01:18:44.236
The edge of time is an ecstatic
union with the unknown.


1339
01:18:45.104 --> 01:18:47.006
It's the increase of ecstasy

1340
01:18:47.039 --> 01:18:49.709
that is the aim
of consciousness.


1341
01:18:49.742 --> 01:18:52.545
We've come to the end of an age.

1342
01:18:52.578 --> 01:18:55.047
Something is happening
on planet earth.


1343
01:18:55.081 --> 01:18:56.182
Look around you.

1344
01:18:56.215 --> 01:18:59.185
Everything is changing and
it's not changing in ways


1345
01:18:59.218 --> 01:19:02.054
that are going to be positive
for the human species.


1346
01:19:02.088 --> 01:19:04.090
It's gonna be getting
harder to live on earth


1347
01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:06.759
because earth is
is tired and old.


1348
01:19:06.792 --> 01:19:11.797
There is a peace
beyond this life


1349
01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.834
that we will find
and we will taste.


1350
01:19:14.867 --> 01:19:19.872
The visitors are here as
midwives to the birth of man.


1351
01:19:21.807 --> 01:19:24.076
That is the answer.

1352
01:19:26.712 --> 01:19:29.515
(gentle music)

1353
01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:36.655
Well, John, I think you are
ready to go through a new door.


1354
01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:44.730
I'm gonna open that door
and you are going out.


1355
01:19:47.666 --> 01:19:49.235
- I'm at peace with
the information,


1356
01:19:49.269 --> 01:19:54.274
but I am still struggling with
integrating that information.


1357
01:19:55.741 --> 01:19:57.243
That bright, shiny lights in
this sky can make you think


1358
01:19:57.277 --> 01:19:59.779
about who you are as a person.

1359
01:19:59.812 --> 01:20:01.080
How does that make sense?

1360
01:20:01.113 --> 01:20:02.815
These are the things
that I'm seeking.


1361
01:20:02.848 --> 01:20:05.818
These are the things that
I need to understand.


1362
01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:10.122
I need some more help and now
I need to take the next steps.


1363
01:20:10.156 --> 01:20:13.225
So I'm hoping I'll be
guided to the next person


1364
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:16.629
who can gimme some direction
and help me finally


1365
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.333
at long last move forward.

1366
