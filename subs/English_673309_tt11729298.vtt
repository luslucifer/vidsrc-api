00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:03.592
[Crowd cheering]

2
00:00:03.676 --> 00:00:07.471
[Man] Joining us for
the toss of the coin,

3
00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:09.849
the president of the United States.

4
00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:16.272
[Man 2] Mister president,
will you please toss the coin?


5
00:00:17.273 --> 00:00:18.816
[Ronald Regan] It is tails.

6
00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.693
[Crowd cheering]

7
00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:29.410
[Man 1] San Francisco has won the toss.

8
00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:31.346
- You can elect to kick...
- [Man 3] We want the ball.


9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.490
[Man 1] You want the ball?
Which goal will you defend?


10
00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.000
Will you put your backs
to the goal, please?


11
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.632
[Announcer] Joe Montana
joins his teammates on the field.


12
00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:48.387
Super bowl xix, the Miami dolphins,
and the San Francisco 49ers.


13
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:52.099
The best combined records of any two teams
to ever meet in a super bowl.


14
00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:55.686
And Joe Montana...
They talk of the cool of Dan Marino.


15
00:00:56.812 --> 00:01:00.232
[Kurt Warner] Super bowl xix.
Second quarter.


16
00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:03.361
Joe Montana steps
to the line of scrimmage,


17
00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:05.529
drops back to throw, and then...

18
00:01:05.613 --> 00:01:06.864
[Announcer] Montana in trouble

19
00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.241
and Doug betters covers him quickly
at the 42-yard line.


20
00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:11.219
[Announcer 2] You feel pretty good,
then all of a sudden,


21
00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:12.403
the pocket starts to cave in.

22
00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:14.789
[Kurt] Now this might seem like a failure.
A mistake.


23
00:01:14.872 --> 00:01:17.708
But of all the characteristics
needed to be an all-pro quarterback,


24
00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:22.671
this one is rarely talked about:
The ability to stay in the pocket,


25
00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:27.009
to stay calm and collected as a wall
of humanity collapses around you.


26
00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:29.512
The courage to stand your ground
and take the hit.


27
00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:33.099
And then have the will to get back up,
and do it all over again.


28
00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:38.020
Drop back, settle,
deliver the perfect throw.


29
00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:44.735
[Announcer] And another record has fallen.
Another one to Joe Montana.


30
00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.612
[Announcer 2] Falling all over the place.

31
00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:49.949
They really put on a terrific show,
particularly offensively and...


32
00:01:50.032 --> 00:01:53.661
[Announcer 1] A little roll to the right.
Montana. Fires a shot... [fades out]


33
00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.915
How much longer?
I want to play some atari.


34
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.960
Kufi?

35
00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:05.005
[Kurt] Ever since I saw Joe Montana
become the mvp of that super bowl


36
00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:10.344
and break his all-time pass record,
I knew I wanted to be that guy.


37
00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:18.269
Over a million athletes play high school
football every year in america,


38
00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:20.938
each with a dream of their own.

39
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.816
Only about five percent of them
make it to college ball.


40
00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.736
And only one percent of those
get drafted to the NFL.


41
00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:31.740
Most don't stay in the league
for more than three years.


42
00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:33.993
Most are not quarterbacks.

43
00:02:34.076 --> 00:02:36.704
Only a select few will ever play
in the super bowl


44
00:02:36.787 --> 00:02:41.167
and each year,
there's only one mvp of that game.


45
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:45.838
So, by all accounts, my dream,

46
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:49.091
my story is impossible.

47
00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:52.303
That's just the kind of story this is.

48
00:03:04.857 --> 00:03:06.233
- [Crowd cheering]
- All right.


49
00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:09.862
All right, boys. All right, boys.
Let's do this.


50
00:03:10.863 --> 00:03:14.867
Uh, trips right, 70-wide special.
On one, ready.


51
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.454
[Announcer] And that will bring on Kurt
Warner, the fifth year senior,


52
00:03:18.537 --> 00:03:20.289
making his first start.

53
00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:23.751
Remember, folks,
he's sat on the bench for four years


54
00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:26.128
even though he was highly recruited
out of high school.


55
00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:27.421
Blue, 60, hut!

56
00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:29.465
[Announcer] Warner takes the snap.

57
00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:31.550
A strong interior rush.

58
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:36.055
Leveled by middle linebacker Cole banks.
A punishing hit.


59
00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:37.890
[Indistinct yelling]

60
00:03:41.727 --> 00:03:42.937
Whoo!

61
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.605
Get set, get set, get set!

62
00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:45.940
Blue, 60, hut!

63
00:03:46.023 --> 00:03:47.733
[Grunting]

64
00:03:47.816 --> 00:03:51.153
He's flushed out of the pocket,
scrambling to his left.


65
00:03:51.237 --> 00:03:52.404
[Coach] Stay in the pocket!

66
00:03:52.488 --> 00:03:55.608
[Announcer] He's running out of real
estate and throws the ball across his body


67
00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:57.868
towards the corner of the end zone.

68
00:03:57.952 --> 00:04:01.914
- Touchdown! Touchdown, panthers!
- [Laughing]


69
00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:06.085
How you like that, coach?

70
00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:07.962
You still didn't stay in the damn pocket.

71
00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:09.046
Yeah, you're welcome.

72
00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:11.507
Kicking game! Move it!

73
00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:17.888
[Announcer indistinct]

74
00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:23.477
Ineligible, downfield. On...

75
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.979
[Tape rewinding]

76
00:04:29.608 --> 00:04:31.151
- [Sighs]
- [Man] Okay.


77
00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:34.506
I'm gonna wear this one.
You take this one. All right?


78
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.490
No, no. I'm staying here.
I got work to do.


79
00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:38.909
Work? Man, you can hardly call that work.

80
00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:41.704
How you gonna make a highlight reel
with no highlights? Huh?


81
00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:44.373
- You only started two games. Just sayin'.
- I have highlights.


82
00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:45.892
And who you are you
going to send that to?

83
00:04:45.916 --> 00:04:47.668
- Scouts. Agents.
- [Chuckles]


84
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:49.044
You really are delusional, huh?

85
00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:50.796
Look, the NFL's not gonna draft some noob

86
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.592
who's been sitting on the bench for four
years at a i-aa school in Iowa.


87
00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:56.010
It's madness.

88
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:00.848
Come on. We're going out.

89
00:05:02.808 --> 00:05:05.394
I'm never gonna wear this.

90
00:05:05.477 --> 00:05:07.521
["Wink" by Neal McCoy playing]

91
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:13.736
[Kurt] Hudnutt, how do you
listen to this music? It is garbage.


92
00:05:14.737 --> 00:05:16.423
[Hudnutt] Okay,
have a good old time. Let's go.


93
00:05:16.447 --> 00:05:18.407
[Song continues]

94
00:05:29.918 --> 00:05:31.295
Can we get two buds?

95
00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:32.963
- Thank you.
- Okay.


96
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:36.634
- I'm gonna make a lap.
- You do that. Have fun.


97
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.219

[Grunting]

101
00:06:20.177 --> 00:06:21.970
No, no, no, no. 
Stay in the pocket.

102
00:06:24.014 --> 00:06:25.182
Yeah!

103
00:06:25.265 --> 00:06:26.725
- [Grunts]
- What did I say?


104
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:28.227
What did I say?

[Whistle blowing]

106
00:06:30.437 --> 00:06:33.315
- To stay in the pocket, coach.
- Bingo, hotshot.


107

everybody to sportscenter.

to ask you a favor

and I'm gonna appreciate you
not laughing at me too much.

Can't wait to hear this.

What, like-like...
Dance, like-like line dance?


120
00:07:07.516 --> 00:07:09.852
Like line dancing, barn dancing,

121
00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:11.812
- all the dancing...

how happy this makes me.

can you play a line...

Uh, uh, not a line dance.
A barn dance for me?

All right, it's a barn dance. Barn dance.

Excuse me, cowboy.
I'm going to take this one.

Nope. Not yet.

So, football? Tell me about that.

156
00:09:24.987 --> 00:09:26.627
How do you mean?
What do you want to know?


157
00:09:26.697 --> 00:09:29.777
Well, you defined yourself as a sport,
so, it must be pretty important to you.

I just love it.

why he loves something, so...

[Chuckles]

162

Okay. Okay, how about this?

163
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:45.883
I'll answer your question,
but first you gotta answer one of mine.


164
00:09:45.966 --> 00:09:49.011
Uh... what exactly
is miss August over there?


165
00:09:49.094 --> 00:09:52.848
[Chuckles, coughs] That is, um...

166
00:09:52.931 --> 00:09:56.602
- That's a tight fitting jeans contest.
- Oh, is it really? [Chuckles]


167
00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:58.830

It's the first time I won.

Um, so football, seriously.

170
00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:05.670
You give me an honest answer
and I'll give you my name.

[Clears throat] Okay.

172
00:10:09.865 --> 00:10:14.828
So, football was the most important thing
my pops taught me before he...


173
00:10:16.121 --> 00:10:18.665
Uh, left.

174
00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:23.211
I mean, he's back in my life now but,
you know, back then it was tough,


175
00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:25.714
and, uh, we always,
uh, you know, struggled.

Me and my mom, my brother.

Never had enough. 
And I wanted more.

I wanted to make something of my life.

179
00:10:34.765 --> 00:10:36.016
And football, um...

180
00:10:37.476 --> 00:10:40.437
Is just like the only thing I've ever
really been good at. So...


181
00:10:42.439 --> 00:10:44.942
Just feels like more
than a game to me.

182
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:50.781
As long as I have
a ball in my hands,

183
00:10:52.282 --> 00:10:54.952
then I feel like everything's
gonna be all right.


184
00:10:58.163 --> 00:10:59.873
Is that honest enough for you?

[Chuckles] Well, 
I hate sports.

00:17:58.041 --> 00:17:59.459
[Whistle blows]

306
00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:01.419
Punt! Tanner, come here.

307
00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:05.590
What are you doing? First down is 25.
Your job is to move the chains.


308
00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:09.260
Come on, boys.
We've done this a thousand times before.


309
00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:12.514
Hey, coach.
Put me in and I can win for you.


310
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:16.976
- Come on. Coach, come on.
- [Man] Uni on three. One, two, three.


311
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.061
[Team] Uni!

312
00:18:18.144 --> 00:18:20.563
[Coach] You're back on the bench
for the same reason


313
00:18:20.647 --> 00:18:22.440
you sat on that bench for four years.

314
00:18:22.524 --> 00:18:24.234
[Kurt] What is your problem with me,
coach?


315
00:18:24.317 --> 00:18:28.905
Want me to sum it up for you,
why you're such a tragedy?


316
00:18:28.988 --> 00:18:31.491
- You don't stay in the pocket.
- What?


317
00:18:31.574 --> 00:18:35.662
You got the talent, loads of it,
but when things get hard, you bail.


318
00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:39.207
You run from adversity.
You don't trust your team or my playbook.


319
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.376
- [Sighs]
- You don't deserve to play in the game.


320
00:18:41.459 --> 00:18:43.920
Coach, ten more games
and my dream is gone.


321
00:18:44.003 --> 00:18:45.964
I've been working my whole life
for this, please.


322
00:18:46.047 --> 00:18:48.466
You need to start thinking about life
after football, son.


323
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.554
[Stammers]
Respectfully, you are wrong, coach.


324
00:18:52.637 --> 00:18:54.889
I'm not gonna quit.
'Cause that's not what leaders do.


325
00:18:54.973 --> 00:18:57.016
I just need to know
how to get on that field.


326
00:19:00.937 --> 00:19:02.063
Blue, 80, hut!

327
00:19:02.147 --> 00:19:03.898
[Grunting]

328
00:19:05.942 --> 00:19:07.527
- [Man] Yeah!
- Again.


329
00:19:10.822 --> 00:19:12.323
[Grunting]

330
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:14.951
[Man] Loser!

331
00:19:15.034 --> 00:19:17.537
You can throw,
but you cannot leave the pocket.


332
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.789
You want your shot? 
You take the pain.

333
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:21.791
Hurry up!

334
00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:23.042
Blue, 80, hut!

335
00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:26.546
[Grunting]

336
00:19:26.629 --> 00:19:28.774
[Coach] Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't you fumble my football.


337
00:19:28.798 --> 00:19:30.925
- [Coughing]
- You hold onto my football.


338
00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:32.552
Again!

339
00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:34.095
- [Grunting]
- Again.


340
00:19:36.097 --> 00:19:37.348
I said again.

341
00:19:39.851 --> 00:19:42.770
- Again.
- [Man] Get up, Kurt.


342
00:19:42.854 --> 00:19:44.582
How many more times
are we gonna do this, coach?


343
00:19:44.606 --> 00:19:47.025
As many times as I say.
Who else wants to kill Kurt?


344
00:19:47.108 --> 00:19:50.361
- I do.
- Hudnutt, you're on offense.


345
00:19:50.445 --> 00:19:52.280
I'll switch for this, though, baby.

346
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:55.200
Somebody give me a purple Jersey. Come on!

347
00:19:57.368 --> 00:19:59.162
[Phone ringing]

348
00:20:00.371 --> 00:20:02.248
- Hello?
- [Kurt] Hey, there.


349
00:20:02.332 --> 00:20:03.958
I'm startin'. Next week.

350
00:20:04.042 --> 00:20:05.668
It's Kurt, by the way. Warner.

351
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.921
You get my messages?

352
00:20:08.004 --> 00:20:12.383
- Yeah. All of 'em.
- See? I called first. That's good, right?


353
00:20:12.467 --> 00:20:15.094
What do you say?
Monday night, let's go on a date.


354
00:20:16.137 --> 00:20:18.640
What are we gonna do? Walk?

355
00:20:18.723 --> 00:20:22.477
Is that a yes?
'Cause it sounds like a yes.


356
00:20:23.603 --> 00:20:25.021
I think you're trying to say yes.

357
00:20:27.023 --> 00:20:28.316
[Horn honking]

358
00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:34.864
- What are you doing?
- Got us a ride.


359
00:20:34.948 --> 00:20:36.783
Kurt, I have kids.
You should've called first.


360
00:20:36.866 --> 00:20:39.327
I did call. You hung up on me, don't you
remember?


361
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.579
[Chuckling] Oh, god, you're insane.

362
00:20:42.914 --> 00:20:44.374
I saw that smile.

363
00:20:44.457 --> 00:20:45.792
Yep.

364
00:20:48.503 --> 00:20:49.504
Hey, kids...

365
00:20:51.548 --> 00:20:53.466
[Kurt]
You ever been out here before?


366
00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.052
- [Brenda] No. It's real pretty.
- Yeah.


367
00:20:58.304 --> 00:21:01.474
Real peaceful, too.
It's one of my favorite places to come.


368
00:21:07.855 --> 00:21:09.357
I dig your tattoo.

369
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.695
Yeah? Semper fidelis. 
It's the motto of—-

370
00:21:13.778 --> 00:21:17.407
for the marines, yeah, yeah.
I saw the pictures on your mantle.


371
00:21:22.537 --> 00:21:26.958
When I was maybe 12, after church,

372
00:21:28.209 --> 00:21:30.461
this woman comes up to me and says,

373
00:21:31.671 --> 00:21:33.798
"there's something special
about you, Brenda.


374
00:21:35.258 --> 00:21:37.552
God is gonna do something great with you."

375
00:21:38.553 --> 00:21:44.183
And... I had the audacity...

376
00:21:45.268 --> 00:21:46.561
To believe her.

377
00:21:47.562 --> 00:21:49.022
So... [stammers]

378
00:21:49.105 --> 00:21:54.193
I had this dream of being a marine,
and marrying a marine,


379
00:21:54.277 --> 00:21:59.949
and having little marine children,
and god, country, and corps all the way.


380
00:22:00.033 --> 00:22:02.785
So, I signed up right outta high school.

381
00:22:03.786 --> 00:22:04.829
Wow.

382
00:22:04.912 --> 00:22:06.247
Then, I met Brad.

383
00:22:07.373 --> 00:22:09.334
A perfect marine.

384
00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:14.005
Whirlwind romance, marriage, and...

385
00:22:15.923 --> 00:22:19.302
Zack was born a year later.

386
00:22:19.385 --> 00:22:23.056
- And what happened to Brad?
- [Brenda breathes deeply]


387
00:22:23.139 --> 00:22:24.682
[Scoffs]

388
00:22:24.766 --> 00:22:27.310
He cheated on me when I was
eight months pregnant with Jesse.


389
00:22:27.393 --> 00:22:32.523
- Oh, what?
- So, um, yeah.


390
00:22:32.607 --> 00:22:34.317
I have some trust issues.

391
00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:41.949
- Was Zack born blind?
- No, he wasn't.


392
00:22:45.662 --> 00:22:52.543
I got this call from Brad
when Zack was four months old.


393
00:22:52.627 --> 00:22:56.339
He said, "he's breathing funny."

394
00:22:57.632 --> 00:23:01.844
And I still remember
the panic in his voice.


395
00:23:03.096 --> 00:23:05.139
And I rushed to the hospital, where...

396
00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:10.228
We were told his brain was swelling

397
00:23:10.311 --> 00:23:13.314
and that he'd be lucky
to make it through the night.


398
00:23:14.565 --> 00:23:17.318
And they had no idea
what was wrong, 'cause...


399
00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:19.570
[Scoffs]

400
00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:28.162
'Cause Brad didn't tell us,
not for 24 hours, that...


401
00:23:29.163 --> 00:23:30.790
[Sniffles]

402
00:23:30.873 --> 00:23:34.919
He accidentally dropped Zack.

403
00:23:35.002 --> 00:23:37.171
On his head. In the tub.

404
00:23:43.428 --> 00:23:46.180
Could've been different, you know,
if he just told the truth.


405
00:23:48.725 --> 00:23:50.810
[Sighs] I remember...

406
00:23:53.229 --> 00:23:56.149
Praying, and praying,

407
00:23:56.232 --> 00:24:01.070
and begging god
to just save my baby boy.


408
00:24:04.824 --> 00:24:10.371
So, the doctor told me
he'd never walk, and yet...


409
00:24:11.372 --> 00:24:12.957
That he'd never talk, and...

410
00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:16.502
Now, I can't get him to stop.

411
00:24:20.381 --> 00:24:22.091
That he'd never be a black truck driver.

412
00:24:22.175 --> 00:24:25.636
[Chuckles] He keeps finding a way
to prove everyone wrong.


413
00:24:26.679 --> 00:24:30.016
He's... [breathes deeply]
He's my miracle.


414
00:24:32.602 --> 00:24:37.482
That all seems pretty, uh,
important to you in your life.


415
00:24:37.565 --> 00:24:38.566
Religion and god.

416
00:24:40.276 --> 00:24:44.781
Yeah, it's-it's more like a relationship
for me, and...


417
00:24:45.865 --> 00:24:48.326
Yes. It defines me.

418
00:24:51.996 --> 00:24:56.793
And that lady who came up and talked
to you at church all those years ago,


419
00:24:56.876 --> 00:24:58.419
you still believe her?

420
00:24:58.503 --> 00:25:01.214
[Soft chuckle] I'm trying.

421
00:25:02.423 --> 00:25:04.300
I'm a work in progress.

422
00:25:10.014 --> 00:25:13.935
- This is where you bring all your girls?
- [Laughs] Are you my girl now?


423
00:25:14.018 --> 00:25:15.102
[Brenda] No.

424
00:25:15.186 --> 00:25:16.663
- [Jenny Jo] Hey, there.
- [Brenda] Hey.


425
00:25:16.687 --> 00:25:18.981
- [Chuckles]
- You just come with me.


426
00:25:19.065 --> 00:25:20.983
Hi. Good to see you again.

427
00:25:21.067 --> 00:25:22.628
- Yes, good to see you.
- Kurt, this is my dad.


428
00:25:22.652 --> 00:25:24.338
- Hey, there.
- Hello, sir, pleasure to meet you.


429
00:25:24.362 --> 00:25:26.280
- I want grandma.
- Yeah?


430
00:25:26.364 --> 00:25:28.533
- He's cute.
- Oh, will you stop it?


431
00:25:28.616 --> 00:25:31.077
- Please, I'm married.
- That's my sister.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.912
- Nice to meet ya.
- [Chuckles]


433
00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:36.874
Uh, hey, dad,
could you give us a minute?


434
00:25:37.959 --> 00:25:40.628
It's my garage. 
I wasn't finished yet.

435
00:25:42.296 --> 00:25:43.506
[Brenda] All right.

436
00:25:43.589 --> 00:25:47.093
Okay, I'm trying to imagine a scenario
where any of this works.


437
00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:48.177
What, exactly?

438
00:25:48.261 --> 00:25:51.138
- Y-You know, us.
- Oh, we're an "us" now. That's good news.


439
00:25:51.222 --> 00:25:53.702
- This is crazy. This isn't gonna work.
- You keep saying that.


440
00:25:53.766 --> 00:25:55.685
I just can't... [sighs]

- So, tomorrow night?
- Yep.


443
00:26:07.989 --> 00:26:09.031
All right.

with a future professional athlete?

[Announcer] Kurt Warner
has been absolutely on fire today.


458
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:58.289
And I'm telling you folks,
there's been a growing buzz


459
00:26:58.372 --> 00:27:03.002
that this kid may be the dark horse
in this year's NFL draft.


460
00:27:03.085 --> 00:27:04.897
[Kurt] I wa... I was voted
gateway player of the year


461
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:06.714
and our team was first in conference.

462
00:27:08.257 --> 00:27:12.011
[Man on phone] Look, it's rare
that a i-aa player gets drafted.


463
00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:15.556
But let's see what we can do.

464
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.894
- Thank you! Yes! I-I-I promise...
- Okay, gotta grab this.


465
00:27:19.977 --> 00:27:22.897
- Look forward to it, buddy.
- I got an agent!


466
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.565
- Let's go!
- I got an agent!


467
00:27:25.566 --> 00:27:26.567
[Horn honking]

468
00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:35.451
[Chuckling]

469
00:27:35.534 --> 00:27:36.911
Hey.

470
00:27:41.415 --> 00:27:42.416
[Kurt grunts]

471
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.419
[Mom] Hey. Draft day.

472
00:27:45.503 --> 00:27:47.463
[Chuckles] How do you feel?
Are you nervous?


473
00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:49.566
Yeah, no, I feel good.
I just want my chance, you know.


474
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.511
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Who's this over here?


475
00:27:53.594 --> 00:27:57.348
Oh, yeah, mom, so, this is Brenda.
And this is her son, Zack.


476
00:27:57.431 --> 00:28:00.810
- Hi.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.


477
00:28:02.353 --> 00:28:06.107
The, uh, bengals
have selected Dan wilkinson,


478
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.402
- defensive tackle, Ohio state university.
- [Zack] Pick Kurt. Pick Kurt.


479
00:28:09.485 --> 00:28:10.885
- [Kurt chuckles]
- Shh, sweetheart.


480
00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:13.447
No, no, no, no, hey, it's okay.
[Chuckles] It's okay.


481
00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:15.574
I probably won't get picked
until tomorrow, though.


482
00:28:15.658 --> 00:28:17.118
Tomorrow?

483
00:28:18.244 --> 00:28:22.164
Yeah, there's seven rounds of picks
that are, uh, spread out over two days,


484
00:28:22.248 --> 00:28:25.459
so, if I get picked... well, when I get
picked, it'll be in the later rounds.


485
00:28:25.543 --> 00:28:27.420
Kurt, it's Zack's birthday
tomorrow, remember?


486
00:28:27.503 --> 00:28:29.940
- We're havin' a party at the house?
- Birthday. It's my birthday.


487
00:28:29.964 --> 00:28:32.359
[Kurt] No, no, no, it'll be fine, Brenda.
You guys can start the party,


488
00:28:32.383 --> 00:28:33.860
and then I'll just join
as soon as this is over.


489
00:28:33.884 --> 00:28:36.345
And then, we can all
celebrate together, you know?


490
00:28:36.429 --> 00:28:38.639
- Right.
- [Man on TV] ...Trading the pick,


491
00:28:38.723 --> 00:28:40.808
and that was something
that'd been debated for weeks.


492
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:43.060
If Seattle would've said,
"hey, Cortez Kennedy,


493
00:28:43.144 --> 00:28:45.163
twenty-seven other teams,
he's out there for a trade,"


494
00:28:45.187 --> 00:28:47.165
what kind of options
would they have gotten in return?


495
00:28:47.189 --> 00:28:48.589
- [Door opens]
- [Kurt] Here you go.


496
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:50.526
- [Zack] Bye, Kurt.
- [Kurt] Bye. Bye, z-man.


497
00:28:50.609 --> 00:28:52.361
Bye, Brenda. Drive safe.

498
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:58.951
[Door opens, closes]

499
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.290
- You sure you're good driving me back?
- Ain't a problem.


500
00:29:07.376 --> 00:29:08.919
You sure that's a good idea?

501
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.921
What?

502
00:29:12.256 --> 00:29:16.260
Single mom, two kids. 
That's no joke.

503
00:29:16.343 --> 00:29:17.428
I would know.

504
00:29:18.971 --> 00:29:20.806
Is that really the life you want?

505
00:29:25.978 --> 00:29:26.979
[Zack] Yay!

506
00:29:27.063 --> 00:29:28.230
[Indistinct chatter]

507
00:29:28.314 --> 00:29:29.857
- [Brenda] Who wants cake?
- I do.


508
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.626
- Yes!
- [Brenda] You got a fork? Okay, good.


509
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.027
Okay, here you go, honey.

510
00:29:34.028 --> 00:29:36.864
And another piece of cake
comin' right up for you.


511
00:29:36.947 --> 00:29:37.990
[Door closes]

512
00:29:42.661 --> 00:29:43.788
[Sighs]

513
00:29:46.457 --> 00:29:48.375
- [Zack giggles]
- [Brenda] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.


514
00:29:48.459 --> 00:29:51.921
- Happy birthday, Zack.
- Vvantcake?


515
00:29:52.004 --> 00:29:54.024
Come on, well, you're-you're-you're
just in time for the cake.


516
00:29:54.048 --> 00:29:56.717
- Yeah.
- You made it just in time.


517
00:29:58.594 --> 00:30:00.513
[Zack] See? Cake.

518
00:30:00.596 --> 00:30:01.782
- Over there.
- [Mouthing] I'm sorry.


519
00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:04.016
I can't wait to eat mine.

520
00:30:05.142 --> 00:30:07.353
- How's it taste?
- Good.


521
00:30:07.436 --> 00:30:10.689
- I bet real sugary, huh?
- [Jesse babbles]


522
00:30:10.773 --> 00:30:12.650
How you feel? Older?

523
00:30:14.235 --> 00:30:15.235
[Sighs]

524
00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:17.529
[Grunts]

525
00:30:23.994 --> 00:30:26.413
[Brenda] I was wondering where you were.

526
00:30:26.497 --> 00:30:28.082
[Sighs] Hey.

527
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.172
You wanna talk to me?

528
00:30:36.841 --> 00:30:38.092
[Sighs]

529
00:30:39.635 --> 00:30:41.488
I'm just wondering why god
would give me a dream


530
00:30:41.512 --> 00:30:43.097
that's probably never gonna come true.

531
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.142
'Cause I just feel like
that's cruel, you know?


532
00:30:51.397 --> 00:30:53.500
Babe, you know what? I just want...
I just want my shot.


533
00:30:53.524 --> 00:30:57.820
[Stutters] I just...
I want one chance, so I can prove...


534
00:30:57.903 --> 00:30:58.946
Prove what?

535
00:31:02.366 --> 00:31:04.451
Prove that I'm good enough, that's what.

536
00:31:08.581 --> 00:31:12.042
I don't think a football game
is ever gonna do that.


537
00:31:15.337 --> 00:31:17.339
It doesn't have to define you.

538
00:31:21.677 --> 00:31:24.972
But if this is your dream,
you have to go fight for it.


539
00:31:27.349 --> 00:31:30.269
So, how do you think, uh,
the bears are gonna do this year, son?


540
00:31:31.896 --> 00:31:34.481
Well, they just fired ditka,

541
00:31:34.565 --> 00:31:37.401
so things are probably
gonna get worse before they...


542
00:31:40.446 --> 00:31:41.447
Did they call?

543
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.865
- Hm?
- Are you kidding me?


544
00:31:42.948 --> 00:31:44.551
Did somebody from the bears
call here today?


545
00:31:44.575 --> 00:31:46.720
Oh, no, no, no, no,
the bears didn't call, buddy, I'm sorry.


546
00:31:46.744 --> 00:31:49.330
[Chuckles] I'm sorry. No.

547
00:31:49.413 --> 00:31:50.413
[Clears throat]

548
00:31:51.457 --> 00:31:53.250
The packers called.

549
00:31:53.334 --> 00:31:54.877
- They wanna sign you.
- Come on.


550
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.962
- No, they do.
- Come on! [Laughs]


551
00:31:57.046 --> 00:31:59.173
- Oh, wow.
- Congratulations.


552
00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:01.383
[Laughs] Green bay!

553
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.222
[Chuckles] $5,000 signing bonus, baby!

554
00:32:06.305 --> 00:32:07.723
Pretty great, huh?

555
00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:09.433
Thank you so much. [Grunts]

556
00:32:09.516 --> 00:32:12.186
It is green.
For the packers, green bay. Get it?


557
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:13.270
Yeah, we get it.

558
00:32:14.313 --> 00:32:15.689
Packers for life.

559
00:32:17.942 --> 00:32:20.194
- That's why she's green.
- Yeah, we get it, man.


560
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.950
Hey.

561
00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:28.035
I don't wanna leave you.

562
00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:31.622
- I don't wanna leave you.
- Aww.


563
00:32:31.705 --> 00:32:34.643
[Kurt] You ever feel like your whole life
was just leadin' up to one moment?


564
00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:36.043
[Inhales deeply]

565
00:32:36.126 --> 00:32:37.962
Then go make the most of it.

566
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:40.630
Hey.

567
00:32:41.715 --> 00:32:44.551
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.


568
00:32:44.635 --> 00:32:48.973
I'm happy for you, but I know
that this is gonna change things.


569
00:32:49.056 --> 00:32:50.766
Your life is gonna get busier, and...

570
00:32:50.849 --> 00:32:53.227
Hey, hey, Brenda, Brenda, Brenda,
Brenda, it's okay.


571
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.520
We'll figure it out.

572
00:32:56.063 --> 00:32:57.898
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

573
00:33:02.111 --> 00:33:03.404
[Moans]

574
00:33:05.364 --> 00:33:07.199
- I miss you already.
- Me too.


575
00:33:07.283 --> 00:33:09.010
- I'll call you when I get... I will.
- You drive safe.


576
00:33:09.034 --> 00:33:10.452
I'll call you when I get there.

577
00:33:10.536 --> 00:33:11.996
- You better.
- Packers for life!

[Indistinct chattering]

Hey, pop. Pop Warner.
Let's see what you got.

Uh, yeah, I... coach, I just got here.
I don't know the playbook yet.

00:34:25.027 --> 00:34:26.747
- You don't wanna go in?
- I do wanna go in.


589
00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:29.466
I just don't wanna blow it out there.
You give me till tomorrow, I'll know it.

- Yeah, thanks for comin' in, Warner.


592
00:34:42.252 --> 00:34:43.253
Hey.

593
00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:45.464
Wish you well.

594
00:34:46.757 --> 00:34:47.758
Wait, what?

595
00:34:47.841 --> 00:34:48.926
We're letting you go.

596

No, no, you're letting me go?
No. I just got here.

- You-you haven't even seen me play yet.
- Well, we tried.

No, I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm not gonna leave.

- Not yet. You-you can't cut me.
- You cut yourself, okay?


600
00:34:59.144 --> 00:35:01.814
Coach, please. I have been
working for this my entire life.


601
00:35:01.897 --> 00:35:03.273
Stop it. Come on. 
Don't do that.

602
00:35:04.274 --> 00:35:06.634
If it were true, you would've been
ready to go on the field.

You're not.

604
00:35:10.989 --> 00:35:12.533
I'MMA need that playbook.

I've called every team in the NFL,
no one's interested.


607
00:35:33.429 --> 00:35:35.013
I wanna go on, I do.

608
00:35:35.097 --> 00:35:37.516
But, I mean, look at me, I'm...

609
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.061
I'm unemployed, I'm homeless.

Then move in.

613

What?

614
00:35:53.657 --> 00:35:55.325
With us. My family.

615
00:35:57.911 --> 00:36:00.706
With nursing school starting,
I could use a live-in nanny.


616
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.209
We're both gonna be struggling, so...

617
00:36:05.335 --> 00:36:09.631
- Why don't we struggle together?
- Yeah, together.


618
00:36:11.049 --> 00:36:12.676
What is your mom gonna think?

619
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.306
It's your mom I'm worried about.
That woman hates me.


620
00:36:19.391 --> 00:36:22.060
I mean, she do... I mean...

00:36:24.563 --> 00:36:25.707
[Announcer] Favre to put it up.

622

Oh, come on, man,
just throw the dang ball.

That's right, z-man. You like it?

625
00:36:35.073 --> 00:36:36.325
You play.

626
00:36:37.618 --> 00:36:40.996
Yeah, I'd really like to, bud,
but they didn't pick me.


627
00:36:42.122 --> 00:36:43.790
I pick you.

00:36:51.757 --> 00:36:53.592
I pick you too, bud.

- Mm-hmm.

00:37:28.001 --> 00:37:29.002
Anything else for ya?

00:37:29.086 --> 00:37:30.379
No, that's...

Uh, actually, yeah. 
Um, can I get a...

Yeah. Stockin' shelves at the hy-vee.
Graveyard shift.


642
00:38:16.883 --> 00:38:18.594
It's just for a little while.

643
00:38:20.012 --> 00:38:21.972
Until next season's tryouts.

644

[Inhales deeply]
You know what they say,


645
00:38:25.642 --> 00:38:27.894
sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do,

646
00:38:27.978 --> 00:38:31.148
until you can do
what you want to do. You know?

We're learning how to insert an iv.

I'll be home by seven. Date night?

more time to see it.

Well, thank you. 
See, this guy gets it.

Yes, I get it.

681
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.099
And what if I told you, starting tomorrow,
you have a job, playin' the game you love?


682
00:41:11.183 --> 00:41:12.493
What are you, a scout or somethin'?

683
00:41:12.517 --> 00:41:13.518
[Chuckles] No.

684
00:41:13.602 --> 00:41:17.773
I'm the proud owner and head coach
of the Iowa barnstormers.

The newest members
of the arena football league.


686
00:41:20.525 --> 00:41:24.780
Right. You're the guy who came up
with this whole arena concept.


687
00:41:24.863 --> 00:41:26.382
Last year,
I was commissioner of the league.


688
00:41:26.406 --> 00:41:28.450
This year, I came home to Iowa
to start my own team,


689
00:41:28.533 --> 00:41:32.621
- and I wanna build it around you.
- So, it's arena football?


690
00:41:32.704 --> 00:41:35.332
No, it is not football, babe.
It's like a circus.

00:41:35.415 --> 00:41:37.793
Yes, that's right. You get it.
People love the circus.

- I like the circus.
- Hey, hey.

I am gonna play football,
and I'm gonna play it in the NFL.

00:41:42.631 --> 00:41:45.759
And I can't do that if I'm playing
arena football in the spring.

This is for guys that are,
you know, circling the drain.

San Diego? There were other offers.


704

Can't you just make some calls?

Look, the teams have moved on.

would want me to ask you this.

Good Christian family, after all,

Do you mind me asking
what's holding you up?


730
00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:45.962
That's-that's okay.

731
00:43:46.046 --> 00:43:49.174
I... no, no, no, no, I... [sighs]

732

That's fine. Um...

733
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:58.683
I guess, I just... I felt like
I needed to prove myself first.


734

Show her I was capable of doin'
what I set out to do.

Be worthy of her.

Well, hell, Kurt.

737
00:44:08.485 --> 00:44:09.986
Accomplishing one thing or the other

738
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.155
is not what's gonna make you
worthy of her.


739
00:44:13.156 --> 00:44:17.035
Life is-is not about what you can achieve,
it's about what you can become.

It's a journey, son. 
It's not an event.

Just promise me this.

742
00:44:24.542 --> 00:44:27.837
You won't take off when things get hard.

743
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:29.798
And they will get hard.

744

Yes, sir.

Take care of these kids for me.

[Woman on radio] A major blizzard caused
accidents across the midwest Monday.

How's the fever?

- The same.
- [Kurt] What happened to the heat?

00:45:26.312 --> 00:45:28.314
You told me not to put it in the mail,
remember?


761
00:45:29.315 --> 00:45:30.525
Damn it.

762
00:45:31.818 --> 00:45:34.529
Maybe we should just go to my mom's
until the storm passes.


763
00:45:36.072 --> 00:45:39.284
Hey, I decided. I'm droppin' out
of school, gettin' a job.


764
00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:42.620
- What? No. No, no, no. No way.
- Kurt, it's not working.


765
00:45:42.704 --> 00:45:45.498
- Nothing here is working.
- Stop. Stop it.


766
00:45:46.499 --> 00:45:49.544
Listen, if this is what you really
wanna do, I'm not gonna let you quit.


767
00:45:49.627 --> 00:45:52.356
Because that's what you did for me,
and that's what we do for each other.


768
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.216
We are not quitting. 
Do you understand?

769
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.052
- [Sighs]
- Okay?


770
00:45:57.135 --> 00:45:59.596
[Zack coughing]

771
00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:00.805
[Both] Yeah.

772
00:46:07.812 --> 00:46:09.689
- [Zack coughs]
- [Brenda] It's bad out here.


773
00:46:12.817 --> 00:46:14.569
Maybe we should head back home.

774
00:46:15.904 --> 00:46:17.405
[Engine sputters]

775
00:46:17.489 --> 00:46:19.407
- Oh. Kurtis?
- [Kurt] Uh...


776
00:46:28.083 --> 00:46:29.959
[Zack coughs]

777
00:46:30.043 --> 00:46:31.920
Baby, we just ran outta gas.

778
00:46:33.296 --> 00:46:36.674
- [Sighs] Oh, my god.
- Okay, all right, there's a...


779
00:46:36.758 --> 00:46:39.135
There's a... there's a gas station
a couple miles back.


780
00:46:39.219 --> 00:46:41.596
That was...
That was more than a couple of miles.


781
00:46:41.679 --> 00:46:44.015
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
I can make it there.


782
00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:46.726
No problem. No problem.
Just grab the change outta the door.


783
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:48.853
- Yep.
- And, check the glove compartment, too.


784
00:46:48.937 --> 00:46:50.873
- Yep. Here's some.
- I'm just gonna checking my pocket.


785
00:46:50.897 --> 00:46:52.899
I got a couple
dollars in my wallet here.

786
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.944
- Here's another quarter.
- Yep, here.


787
00:46:57.695 --> 00:46:58.988
- Stay inside.
- Uh-huh.


788
00:46:59.072 --> 00:47:01.741
- Stay warm. Keep the doors shut.
- Yeah, be-be fast.


789
00:47:02.909 --> 00:47:04.536
[Wind blowing]

790
00:47:14.546 --> 00:47:16.089
Excuse me, hi.

791
00:47:16.172 --> 00:47:20.635
Uh, 4.86 on pump three
and, uh, do you have any gas cans?


792
00:47:20.718 --> 00:47:23.805
- Uh, yeah, man. Five bucks.
- No, no, no, I, uh...


793
00:47:23.888 --> 00:47:25.783
I don't need to buy one,
I just need to borrow one.


794
00:47:25.807 --> 00:47:27.559
I'll bring it right back. [Panting]

795
00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.812
Please, please.

796
00:47:30.895 --> 00:47:33.148
- All right.
- Thank you. Thank you.


797
00:47:43.741 --> 00:47:45.827
[Panting]

798
00:48:12.979 --> 00:48:14.272
Hey. Hey.

799
00:48:14.355 --> 00:48:16.274
- [Brenda] Kurt.
- I'm so sorry, are you okay?


800
00:48:16.357 --> 00:48:17.567
Are you okay?

801
00:48:21.946 --> 00:48:23.990
Let's get you all warmed up.

802
00:48:31.497 --> 00:48:33.208
Brenda, I'm so sorry.

803
00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:35.001
You all could've died out there.

804
00:48:36.836 --> 00:48:38.588
[Brenda] It's not your fault, Kurt.

805
00:48:38.671 --> 00:48:40.131
Yeah, it is my fault.

806
00:48:41.841 --> 00:48:45.887
I promised your father that I would
take care of you and the kids.


807
00:48:47.805 --> 00:48:50.934
So that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

808
00:48:51.017 --> 00:48:52.602
[Sighs]

809

[Breathes deeply]

[Cows mooing]

811
00:49:04.113 --> 00:49:08.201
[Jim] Fifty yards long.
Eight-yard end zones. Eight men each side.


812
00:49:08.284 --> 00:49:13.414
This is not a football field.
This is an arena... for gladiators.


813
00:49:13.498 --> 00:49:16.000
For true believers and lovers of the game.

814
00:49:16.084 --> 00:49:18.836
And right over here is our sideline.

815
00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.382
In our version of the game,
the sideline is a wall.


816
00:49:22.465 --> 00:49:25.760
And it will pound you and punish you.
Trust me.


817
00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:31.557
Kurt Warner.

818
00:49:32.684 --> 00:49:35.937
So, did hell freeze over or are you
just tired of waiting on the NFL?


819
00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.522
[Men laughing]

820
00:49:38.898 --> 00:49:40.358
Uh, bit of both, sir.

821
00:49:41.734 --> 00:49:44.362
Forget everything you think
you know about football.


822
00:49:44.445 --> 00:49:49.033
No punts, no turning back.
It's all pressure.


823
00:49:49.117 --> 00:49:51.035
It's football at the speed of Nascar.

824
00:49:52.036 --> 00:49:54.455
We call it "the 50-yard indoor war."

825
00:49:54.539 --> 00:49:56.207
You think you can handle that, Warner?

826
00:49:58.001 --> 00:49:59.627
I think it's time I tried.

827
00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:01.129
All right, red.

828
00:50:01.212 --> 00:50:02.422
[Whistle blows]

829
00:50:04.966 --> 00:50:08.803
Well, well, well,
look who's still circling the drain.


830
00:50:08.886 --> 00:50:10.680
[Chuckles] What's up, boy?

831
00:50:10.763 --> 00:50:12.682
- [Grunts]
- All right, all right, all right.


832
00:50:12.765 --> 00:50:14.559
[Chuckles] Well, Kurt,

833
00:50:14.642 --> 00:50:17.395
if we gonna go down,
might as well go down together.

Faster, faster. Pull the trigger.
Come on, Warner.


837
00:50:24.277 --> 00:50:25.963
Ooh, that'll wake you
up in the mornin', boy.


838
00:50:25.987 --> 00:50:27.339
- Get outta here.
- You better watch it.


839
00:50:27.363 --> 00:50:29.032
- Get outta here.
- Whoo!


840
00:50:29.115 --> 00:50:30.700
You gotta get rid of the ball, Warner,

841
00:50:30.783 --> 00:50:32.261
you look like you're movin'
in slow motion.


842
00:50:32.285 --> 00:50:33.328
Set, hut!

843

You can't touch me, boy.

[Kurt] Man, it's fast.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.931
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

851

Uh, if this is where we practice,
where on earth do we play?

Hey. Hey, hud. What is that?

Oh, that's the rodeo arena.

Where they have cattle,
cuttin' horse shows, pony shows.

that will bring out a new face.

Kurt Warner from
the university of northern Iowa.


882
00:52:16.931 --> 00:52:20.059
He had quite a reputation
for being a gunslinger with the panthers.


883
00:52:20.143 --> 00:52:23.104
Let's see if he's got
any of that cowboy still in him.

Come on, man!

899

Hey, Warner, that way.
Not that way. Ball there.

Look, you don't have time enough
to drop back and settle like that, man.

It's faster than that.
You just gotta, like, pick it up.

in quarterbacks.

Okay, then why are you upset?

I couldn't get to you
and it felt like everyone else could.


1022
00:58:30.971 --> 00:58:32.765
And then I lost Zack and...

1023
00:58:32.848 --> 00:58:35.035

but hey, babe, we won.

Gonna say it and get it out, and...

I just need an honest answer.

Uh, okay.

1047
00:59:57.641 --> 01:00:00.769
Do you see yourself in my life long-term?

1048
01:00:00.853 --> 01:00:06.692
I mean, watching Zack grow up,
walking Jesse down the aisle.

Standing by my side
at my parents' 50th anniversary.


1050

Do you honestly see yourself there?

1051
01:00:14.909 --> 01:00:17.870
Okay, 'cause I've had
a lot of time to think...


1052
01:00:17.953 --> 01:00:19.806
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me answer your question.


1053
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:23.542
Kurt, you already did. 
I'm happy for you.

1054
01:00:23.626 --> 01:00:27.379
For everything
that's going on in your life.


1055
01:00:27.463 --> 01:00:30.883
[Sighs] But it's not working for my life.

1056
01:00:30.966 --> 01:00:33.510
- Brenda, you...
- Can you please just let me finish?


1057
01:00:34.929 --> 01:00:37.348
I've been through this before,
you know that.


1058
01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:40.059
And I can't do it again.

1059
01:00:40.142 --> 01:00:43.479
So... why don't we
just skip to that part

1060
01:00:43.562 --> 01:00:46.482
and save ourselves a lot of time
and tears?


1061
01:00:46.565 --> 01:00:48.359
So-so...

1062
01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.654
Help me understand this.
What, exactly?


1063
01:00:51.737 --> 01:00:54.215
We're just supposed to end it now,
so we don't have to end it later?


1064
01:00:54.239 --> 01:00:55.366
- Yes.
- Why?


1065
01:00:56.408 --> 01:00:58.118
Because you can't decide. You won't...

1066
01:00:58.202 --> 01:01:00.430
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, no, no,
you don't get to pin that on me.


1067
01:01:00.454 --> 01:01:02.015
No, sorry. You're the one who's afraid...

1068
01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:04.291
- Yes, I'm afraid.
- Yes, you're afraid.


1069
01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:07.586
Of what? Of me bailin' on you?
Of me hurtin' you?


1070
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:09.380
Me bein' some version of your ex?

1071
01:01:09.463 --> 01:01:11.340
I'm afraid that we're
gonna hurt each other.


1072
01:01:11.423 --> 01:01:14.259
- That is the only way that this ends.
- You don't know that!


1073
01:01:14.343 --> 01:01:17.429
Kurt, I want you to chase your dreams,
just not with me.


1074
01:01:32.486 --> 01:01:34.530
[Breathes deeply]

1075
01:01:34.613 --> 01:01:36.240
[Claps hands] Okay.

1076
01:01:44.456 --> 01:01:47.543
- What is that?
- That's my touchdown money.


1077
01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:49.128
Are you paying me to break up?

1078
01:01:49.211 --> 01:01:51.106
I'm pretty sure you're the one
breakin' up with me right now.


1079
01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:52.732
- It was a discussion.
- It was a discussion,


1080
01:01:52.756 --> 01:01:54.883
and now it's a decision.
And you know what?


1081
01:01:57.928 --> 01:01:59.638
[Stammers] I get it.

1082
01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.976
I get it. You're right, Brenda.
You're always right.


1083
01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:07.104
We should just end it now,
and just be done with it.


1084
01:02:07.187 --> 01:02:08.480
Yeah. I gotta get to the game,

1085
01:02:08.564 --> 01:02:10.500
'cause apparently,
that's the only thing I'm any good at.


1086
01:02:10.524 --> 01:02:11.692
Anyway... [inhales deeply]

1087
01:02:11.775 --> 01:02:14.194
Drive safe. Tell the kids I said hi.

1088
01:02:14.278 --> 01:02:17.281
[Door opens, closes]

[Sighs]

1090
01:02:26.123 --> 01:02:28.667
[Jim's voice echoes]
Left 50 pogo, y-cross.


1091
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:31.170
Warner!

1092
01:02:31.253 --> 01:02:34.298
Left 50 pogo, y-cross.
Come on, man.


1093
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.219
Left 50 pogo, y-cross. Ready.

1094
01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:41.555
[Indistinct chatter]

1095
01:02:41.638 --> 01:02:43.515
See 44, see 44!

1096
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.185
Set, hut!

1097
01:02:46.268 --> 01:02:47.895
[Grunting]

1098
01:02:52.107 --> 01:02:54.359
[Announcer] And that'll do it.
With time running out,


1099
01:02:54.443 --> 01:02:57.154
that touchdown will seal the win
for coach foster.


1100
01:02:57.237 --> 01:02:58.989
- Whoo-hoo!
- The Iowa barnstormers


1101
01:02:59.073 --> 01:03:02.159
are heading to the arenabow/
to face tampa bay.


1102
01:03:08.207 --> 01:03:10.000
[Kurt's mom]
Shouldn't you be celebrating?


1103
01:03:10.084 --> 01:03:12.753
[Kurt chuckles]
I mean, what do you think this is?


1104
01:03:12.836 --> 01:03:15.047
- Come on.
- [Chuckles] Oh, god.


1105
01:03:24.389 --> 01:03:25.474
What?

1106
01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:30.395
That is not the face of somebody
that just made the finals.


1107
01:03:33.816 --> 01:03:34.942
Where's Brenda?

1108
01:03:35.025 --> 01:03:37.027
[Inhales sharply]

1109
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:38.821
[Clears throat]

1110
01:03:38.904 --> 01:03:41.865
We, uh... we broke up.

1111
01:03:46.954 --> 01:03:48.163
[Sighs]

1112
01:03:49.498 --> 01:03:52.501
Winning doesn't always
feel like winning, huh?


1113
01:03:54.044 --> 01:03:55.045
It never has.

1114
01:03:59.007 --> 01:04:00.217
Why is that?

1115
01:04:02.803 --> 01:04:06.932
'Cause it doesn't mean anything when you
don't have someone to share it with.


1116
01:04:07.933 --> 01:04:11.103
She should be here, Kurt.
It's wrong that she isn't.


1117
01:04:11.186 --> 01:04:14.273
- I thought you didn't like her.
- No.


1118
01:04:14.356 --> 01:04:15.649
No, I just... [stammers]

1119
01:04:17.276 --> 01:04:19.778
I just saw too
much of myself in her.

1120
01:04:21.655 --> 01:04:25.033
[Stammers] I didn't want you to struggle
the way that I struggled.


1121
01:04:29.454 --> 01:04:32.166
But my story doesn't
have to be her story.

1122
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:39.047
You love her. You stuck with her.

1123
01:04:39.131 --> 01:04:40.883
With those kids.

1124
01:04:43.135 --> 01:04:45.679
You have grown up
to be a good man.

1125
01:04:47.222 --> 01:04:50.559
She makes you happy, Kurt.
I've seen it.


1126
01:04:52.978 --> 01:04:54.646
She makes you better.

[Kurt inhales]

1128

Hi, again. Sportscenter hippin' you
to what's up.

- [Phone ringing]

Coming up, in addition to the items
already mentioned,


1131
01:05:07.159 --> 01:05:09.828
Mark O'Leary is here
to put in proper perspective.


1132
01:05:09.912 --> 01:05:11.788
Raiders head coach Jon gruden says...

1133
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:13.916
Hello?

1134
01:05:13.999 --> 01:05:16.585
[Brenda] Kurt. 
[Crying] Kurt.

1135
01:05:16.668 --> 01:05:18.295
Brenda, what's wrong?

1136
01:05:18.378 --> 01:05:20.380
Kurt, oh, my god, my parents...

1137
01:05:21.381 --> 01:05:23.383
[Man on radio]
A massive amount of damage,


1138
01:05:23.467 --> 01:05:28.138
large trees are downed all over the area,
and the street I'm looking at,


1139
01:05:28.222 --> 01:05:31.642
the entire block has been leveled
to the concrete foundations.


1140
01:05:31.725 --> 01:05:36.438
[Woman on radio] Category four tornado

I got you. I'm right here.

[Cries] How can this be real?

1148

I don't understand.

All my life, I've defined myself
through sports.

What I could accomplish,
how many games I could win.

And I've always come up empty.
It's never been enough.

football. None of that matters.

Hey, Warner.
We got arenabowl this weekend.


1213
01:12:48.244 --> 01:12:50.789
- Yeah.
- Arenabowl. Are you all in?


1214
01:12:50.872 --> 01:12:52.749
- Let's do it.
- [Cheering]


1215
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.836
This. Right here, this is my "all in."

1216
01:13:01.633 --> 01:13:02.926
I love you.

1217

Daddy, will you dance with me?

So good.

[Announcer] After four months
and 16 games, it has come down to this.


1226
01:13:50.098 --> 01:13:53.768
A barn dance in des moines,
and they are rockin' and rollin'

here at the veterans auditorium
in des moines.


1228

The defending champion tampa bay storm
against the Iowa barnstormers.


1229
01:14:01.443 --> 01:14:03.163
Hello, everyone,
along with kirk herbstreit,

01:14:03.236 --> 01:14:04.571
I am Todd christensen.

1231

[Mike golic] Hey, Todd, kirk.

1232
01:14:06.489 --> 01:14:11.536
Cleveland stadium has the dawg pound,
veteran memorial stadium has the barnyard.


1233
01:14:11.619 --> 01:14:14.122
They keep this area
for the "different" people.

[Kurt] Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

1236
01:14:20.211 --> 01:14:22.523
[Announcer] You can feel the momentum
switching to Iowa here


1237
01:14:22.547 --> 01:14:24.591
as they drive for a go-ahead score.

1238
01:14:24.674 --> 01:14:28.470
Twenty-sixth completion by Kurt Warner,
that too is an arenabowl record.


1239
01:14:28.553 --> 01:14:30.054
Warner, the ball is tipped.

1240
01:14:30.138 --> 01:14:32.390
The receiver is able to make the catch.

1241
01:14:32.474 --> 01:14:35.643
Come on! Come on, come on!
Hurry up! Let's go!


1242
01:14:35.727 --> 01:14:39.022
[Announcer] If you don't keep contain
on this guy, he's going to hurt you.


1243
01:14:39.105 --> 01:14:41.733
If they want a championship,
this is where they have to earn it,


1244
01:14:41.816 --> 01:14:43.693
inside this five-yard line.

- Warner pump fakes,


1247
01:14:49.073 --> 01:14:50.873
he's able to buy some time.
He gets rid of it.


1248
01:14:52.952 --> 01:14:54.370
It appears...

1249
01:14:56.164 --> 01:14:57.582
- No!
- [Groans]


1250
01:14:57.665 --> 01:15:00.585
[Announcer] A little pressure
right in the face of Kurt Warner,


1251
01:15:00.668 --> 01:15:02.003
and who would've thought

1252
01:15:02.086 --> 01:15:05.048
that on the one-yard line
that they couldn't get it in?


1253
01:15:05.131 --> 01:15:06.567
[Announcer2]
Takin' a look back at that,


1254
01:15:06.591 --> 01:15:08.927
you can see the pressure
applied there...


1255
01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:11.971
[Announcer1]
The tampa bay storm are the champions.


1256

There you go... oh, my pleasure, yeah.
Thanks for comin' out.


1257

- Sorry we didn't win.
- [Jim] Kurt.

- Hey, Kurt? Excuse us, Brenda.
- Oh, sure.


1259

- There's a gentleman here to see you.
- My pleasure. You stay here, that's fine.


1260
01:15:21.856 --> 01:15:23.024
Heck of a game for you, Kurt.

1261
01:15:23.107 --> 01:15:25.568
Well, thank you,
but it didn't help us win.


1262
01:15:25.652 --> 01:15:27.372
I hate to lose, sir.
I hate it for the team.

come try out for us.

I been puttin' off
his calls for a while.

1268

Can you blame me?

- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm with the rams.

Dick, you... I don't get it.

1273
01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:09.737
I like him. It's a hunch.

1274
01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:13.449
It's arena football.
[Scoffs] You think that'll translate?


1275
01:16:13.533 --> 01:16:15.618
Character translates anywhere, Mike.

1276
01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:17.328
The gm sure likes his price.

1277
01:16:17.412 --> 01:16:19.598
I mean, our groundskeeper's
gonna make more than him this season.


1278
01:16:19.622 --> 01:16:22.876
John, this guy is old. 
Slow as molasses.

1279
01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:25.503
And frankly, he's beneath
the standards of this franchise.


1280
01:16:25.587 --> 01:16:29.716
[Chuckles] That's what people
said about me when I came here.

[Chuckles]

[Man] He's got a howitzer
for a right arm, though.


1283
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:34.721
There is no way this guy
makes the team.


1284
01:16:35.722 --> 01:16:37.056
No way.

1285
01:16:38.892 --> 01:16:40.244

Yeah, way to sling it, Trent. Good boy.

[Clears throat] Yes, sir. 
A long time ago.

Ah. How long did you last?

Not long enough.

is perfection.

on the c-map.


1306

One, two, three, four, five,
step, and throw. Very nice.


1307

Stop. Now, oz, you know why
he put that ball right there, right?


1308
01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:29.144
That's to keep you from gettin' hit.
That's to protect you.

Very good. Excellent ball placement.

Not 14. Right?

can we get this time?

Step, throw, stop. 
It's the wrong read.

It's the wrong damn read!
You're ahead of 'em.

You gotta hit 'em in stride, Kurt.

[Laughs] I don't know, coach,
I was just...


1333
01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:35.443
I was curious as to why everybody
here in the NFL moves so slow.

just called every one of you slow.

So, we gonna end on that,

and on this, which is for Warner,
when he learns to throw a spiral.

you can break 'em
down and take 'em out.

Goodnight, gentlemen.

1341

Hey. Ride it out, rook.
It's all part of the plan.

What are you thinkin'?
How do you drop that?


1348
01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:17.151
That ain't on the qb, coach.

1349

That man is riskin' his life
for you every snap!


1350
01:20:19.737 --> 01:20:22.615
And you don't have the dignity
to hold on to the damn ball?


1351
01:20:23.866 --> 01:20:25.618
You hold on to this ball!

1352
01:20:26.953 --> 01:20:29.872
Yes, sir. That's my mistake.
It won't happen again.


1353
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:38.464
[Dick] All right, let's run it again.

I don't know, Brenda, I don't think
I'm gonna be here much longer.

[Brenda on phone] How do you know that?

1357
01:20:46.264 --> 01:20:48.824
The offensive coordinator hates me.
I mean, I can't prove myself.

He won't let me.
I'm not gettin' any snaps.


1359
01:20:50.601 --> 01:20:52.895
- Hates you?
- Yeah, no, he hates me.


1360
01:20:54.313 --> 01:20:56.482
I mean, this is
Trent green's team, anyway.


1361
01:20:56.566 --> 01:20:58.776
They built it around him,
and he's incredible.


1362
01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.319
- Babe, hang in there.
- [Knocking]


1363
01:21:00.403 --> 01:21:02.446
Hey, Warner,
coach wants to see you upstairs.


1364
01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:08.828
I gotta go.

1365
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:11.747
- I love you.
- I love you, too.


1366
01:21:15.585 --> 01:21:17.503
[Crickets chirping]

1367
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:24.677
[Clears throat] You wanted to see me, sir?

1368
01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.679
Oh. Yes.

1369
01:21:26.762 --> 01:21:29.640
[Breathes deeply]

1370
01:21:32.894 --> 01:21:35.354
How long for you in the wilderness, son?

1371
01:21:38.232 --> 01:21:41.402
[Chuckles] How long outta college?

1372
01:21:43.863 --> 01:21:47.491
Right. Well, yeah, I mean, it's, uh,
it's been a few years.


1373
01:21:48.743 --> 01:21:51.495
But, sir, that doesn't mean
that I don't know how to play the game...


1374
01:21:51.579 --> 01:21:53.956
Fourteen. For me.

1375
01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:56.876
Fourteen years outta coaching.

1376
01:21:59.128 --> 01:22:02.215
I burned out. Not embarrassed to say it.

1377
01:22:02.298 --> 01:22:05.509
Took a year off,
turned out to be a decade and a half.


1378
01:22:05.593 --> 01:22:06.928
And when I did come back,

1379
01:22:07.011 --> 01:22:11.682
they said I was a retread,
a has-been, too old.


1380
01:22:11.766 --> 01:22:13.517
[Chuckles]

1381
01:22:13.601 --> 01:22:15.561
Game had passed me by, all that stuff.

1382
01:22:15.645 --> 01:22:19.482
All that same stuff
that they're gonna say about you.


1383
01:22:21.525 --> 01:22:23.110
[Sighs]

1384
01:22:25.112 --> 01:22:26.447
What they didn't know

1385
01:22:28.282 --> 01:22:32.620
was all that experience
that I had in those years


1386
01:22:32.703 --> 01:22:35.289
made me who I am.

1387
01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:39.669
Made me ready for this moment.

1388
01:22:41.003 --> 01:22:43.464
Gave me something others didn't have.

1389
01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:48.928
And I see that in you, Kurt.

1390
01:22:51.305 --> 01:22:52.306
Destiny...

1391
01:22:55.643 --> 01:22:57.895
It belongs to the underdogs.

1392
01:22:59.438 --> 01:23:02.817
You wanna prove that? Together?

1393
01:23:10.366 --> 01:23:13.327
There's somethin' special about you, son.

1394
01:23:13.411 --> 01:23:17.123
And I'm really gonna enjoy
finding out what that is.


1395
01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:18.749
Welcome to the rams.

1396
01:23:18.833 --> 01:23:21.836
Come on. Come on! [Laughing]

1397
01:23:22.837 --> 01:23:26.007
Oh, my gosh! Oh, coach, thank you.

1398
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:27.466
Thank you for trusting me.

1399
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:29.861
I gotta go tell... I gotta tell my wife.
I gotta tell my wife.


1400
01:23:29.885 --> 01:23:32.085
This is the best decision
you've ever made in your life.


1401
01:23:32.138 --> 01:23:34.140
I promise you. 
I gotta go tell my wife.

1402
01:23:34.223 --> 01:23:36.100
And then we're gonna go get some brews.

1403
01:23:50.614 --> 01:23:51.866
Guys, I'm home.

1404
01:23:57.121 --> 01:23:58.372
Zack?!

1405
01:23:58.456 --> 01:24:00.916
Zack, honey, no! No, no, no.

1406
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.480
Hey, baby, baby... 
Brenda, it's okay.

1407
01:24:02.543 --> 01:24:04.795
It's okay, it's okay, come here.
Sit with me.


1408
01:24:12.094 --> 01:24:13.596
Why would you let him do that?

1409
01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.100
He said he was ready.

1410
01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:21.645
And I believed him.

1411
01:24:25.107 --> 01:24:27.276
Mom, I'm driving!

1412
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.120
- [Chuckles] Yeah, you are, bud!
- Yes, baby!


1413
01:24:30.654 --> 01:24:31.655
[Chuckles]

1414
01:24:36.118 --> 01:24:37.703
[Crowd cheering]

1415
01:24:38.746 --> 01:24:41.624
[Indistinct chattering]

1416
01:24:41.707 --> 01:24:42.833
Let's go! Let's go!

1417
01:24:44.877 --> 01:24:46.337
Come on, Charles!

1418
01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:47.981
[Announcer] Trent green,
the ninth rated passer


1419
01:24:48.005 --> 01:24:52.093
with 81.8 percent
quarterback rating in 1998,


1420
01:24:52.176 --> 01:24:53.761
the real hope for this offense.

1421
01:24:53.844 --> 01:24:57.431
We've been talking about him all game
and all pre-season long.


1422
01:24:57.515 --> 01:24:59.058
Hey, check it out.

1423
01:25:00.309 --> 01:25:01.644
That's my boy.

1424
01:25:01.727 --> 01:25:03.622
This might be the only screen time
he gets, though.


1425
01:25:03.646 --> 01:25:04.772
Boy, shut up.

1426
01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:08.692
[Announcer] To number 18,
Tony small, the rookie...


1427
01:25:08.776 --> 01:25:10.337
- [Announcer 2] Whoa!
- [Announcer 1 indistinct]


1428
01:25:10.361 --> 01:25:12.488
[Announcer2]
Freddie Miller is a bad man.


1429
01:25:13.489 --> 01:25:16.409
Freddie Miller's a bad man.
Now, we got Trent green down.


1430
01:25:16.492 --> 01:25:18.911
He... we've got Trent green down
in the middle of the field.


1431
01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:20.579
This is not the way I saw this...

1432
01:25:20.663 --> 01:25:21.789
[Groans]

1433
01:25:21.872 --> 01:25:24.834
[Announcer 1] And green went down hard
and is not getting up.


1434
01:25:24.917 --> 01:25:27.878
- And that looks bad.
- [Announcer 3] You do not want...


1435
01:25:27.962 --> 01:25:30.589
Writhing in pain,
you do not wanna see this.


1436
01:25:30.673 --> 01:25:32.692
If you're the rams...
If you're anybody, for that matter.


1437
01:25:32.716 --> 01:25:35.803
[Announcer 1] He was in a lot ofpain,
and ya hate to see that


1438
01:25:35.886 --> 01:25:38.264
- after a player gets ya by the knees...
- Son of a...


1439
01:25:38.347 --> 01:25:41.559
From behind, and Isaac Bruce
is obviously upset about it as well.


1440
01:25:41.642 --> 01:25:43.519
[Announcer2]
He should have been penalized.


1441
01:25:43.602 --> 01:25:46.981
[Announcer 1] Kurt Warner, now warming up
on the sideline for the rams.


1442
01:25:47.064 --> 01:25:49.525
- Kurt Warner, a capable backup.
- Oh, my god.


1443
01:25:49.608 --> 01:25:52.212
But certainly not where Trent green is.
And the kind of experience...


1444
01:25:52.236 --> 01:25:55.090
It's been an exciting night for us here
at ESPN, an exciting night for the NFL.


1445
01:25:55.114 --> 01:25:56.591
[Radio host 1] So, obviously, lots of buzz

1446
01:25:56.615 --> 01:25:58.260
coming out this morning here
from the rams' camp.


1447
01:25:58.284 --> 01:26:00.095
And the question of the day is,
"why not Kurt Warner?"


1448
01:26:00.119 --> 01:26:02.389
[Radio host 2] Why not Kurt Warner?
Really? You just said that? Okay.


1449
01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:06.000
[Radio host 3] Kurt Warner replaced
Trent green as the starting quarterback.


1450
01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:07.501
This ain't the guy.

1451
01:26:07.585 --> 01:26:11.046
[Radio host 4] If the rams are gonna trade
for a quality starting quarterback,


1452
01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:13.757
they can't wait.
They've gotta do it right now.


1453
01:26:13.841 --> 01:26:17.178
[Radio host 5] If dick vermeil stays
with this guy, he's gonna be a joke, man.


1454
01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:19.513
Their program is a joke.
The season's over.


1455
01:26:20.514 --> 01:26:22.183
[Knocking on door]

1456
01:26:22.266 --> 01:26:23.267
[Martz] Come in.

1457
01:26:27.438 --> 01:26:29.815
- Sit down, Kurt.
- Thank you, coach, I prefer to stand.


1458
01:26:33.486 --> 01:26:36.322
All right. Go ahead, then. Tell me.

1459
01:26:37.573 --> 01:26:38.741
Tell you what?

1460
01:26:38.824 --> 01:26:40.493
Why a team worth $800 million

1461
01:26:40.576 --> 01:26:44.371
with one of the most complex
offenses ever built, by me,


1462
01:26:44.455 --> 01:26:46.165
should put you in the driver's seat.

1463
01:26:48.792 --> 01:26:51.420
Because you threw some touchdowns
in a little football arena?


1464
01:26:51.504 --> 01:26:52.838
[Chuckles]

1465
01:26:52.922 --> 01:26:56.884
Hm? You're too old to be a rookie.

1466
01:26:56.967 --> 01:26:59.011
You're too green to be a pro,
you don't belong here.


1467
01:27:00.387 --> 01:27:03.349
Well, with all due respect,
sir, you're wrong.


1468
01:27:03.432 --> 01:27:05.552
And if you give me a chance,
I will prove that to you.


1469
01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:08.246
Make us the laughingstock in the league?
Embarrass every member of this team,


1470
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:10.551
- every fan of the city?
- That's not true. It's not true.


1471
01:27:10.606 --> 01:27:13.442
You don't have what it takes.
That's what I believe.


1472
01:27:15.236 --> 01:27:17.947
So, why in the world
would I give you this shot?


1473
01:27:19.573 --> 01:27:22.034
Because this is my time, sir.

1474
01:27:24.578 --> 01:27:27.414
Because I know who I am,
and I know why I'm here.


1475
01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:32.836
Because I've earned it.
I've waited for it, I've bled for it.


1476
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.089
And... [breathes deeply]

1477
01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:37.967
I'm finally ready for it. 
I wasn't before.

1478
01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:40.052
God knows I wasn't, but I am now.

1479
01:27:41.929 --> 01:27:43.472
And I will not let you down.

1480
01:27:45.849 --> 01:27:50.396
You put the ball in my hands,
and we will win.


1481
01:27:53.107 --> 01:27:54.275
That's all, Kurt.

1482
01:28:12.334 --> 01:28:14.128
[Dial tone]

1483
01:28:16.213 --> 01:28:17.590
[Phone buzzing]

1484
01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:22.720
- Hello?
- [Martz] Hey, coach.


1485
01:28:24.513 --> 01:28:25.764
He's ready.

1486
01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:28.976
[Overlapping chatter]

1487
01:28:32.646 --> 01:28:36.859
People asked me last night
how I felt in that press conference.


1488
01:28:36.942 --> 01:28:38.027
[Sighs]

1489
01:28:39.028 --> 01:28:40.321
It hurts.

1490
01:28:40.404 --> 01:28:41.447
Get emotional.

1491
01:28:42.823 --> 01:28:45.034
But that's what this business
is all about.


1492
01:28:49.788 --> 01:28:53.292
We will rally around Kurt Warner.

1493
01:28:54.293 --> 01:28:56.712
And we will play good football.

1494
01:28:56.795 --> 01:28:58.339
[Overlapping chatter]

1495
01:29:05.638 --> 01:29:07.640
[Intro music]

1496
01:29:07.723 --> 01:29:10.893
[Announcer] CBS is proud to present
the national football league.


1497
01:29:10.976 --> 01:29:15.814
Today, we come to you from St. Louis,
Missouri, gateway to the west.


1498
01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:20.361
The trans world dome,
where the ravens and St. Louis rams


1499
01:29:20.444 --> 01:29:22.529
are set to go at it.

1500
01:29:22.613 --> 01:29:25.282
It's kick-off 1999,

1501
01:29:25.366 --> 01:29:29.745
opening day
in the national football league.


1502
01:29:36.418 --> 01:29:37.419
[Exhales]

1503
01:29:42.508 --> 01:29:44.677
[Indistinct yelling]

1504
01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.390
[Brenda] I do like a man in uniform.

1505
01:29:50.933 --> 01:29:52.393
[Mutters]

1506
01:29:52.476 --> 01:29:55.020
What are you...
How did you get in here?

01:30:02.194 --> 01:30:07.241
I, uh... I needed you to hear this
before you went out on that field.


1508
01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:11.662
I was talking with our son,

"To my daddy, Kurt.

And so will you.

That anything can happen.

That maybe god does have something
amazing in store for us.

Maybe that moment's now.

This is the opportunity of a lifetime

01:32:22.209 --> 01:32:25.504
A lot of pressure on the shoulders
of number 13.

If he doesn't perform well today,

the cinderella story could be over
before it even gets started.

ray Lewis is the all-pro in the middle.

of a guess for those people to know...

1593
01:35:13.964 --> 01:35:16.800
Cuts it in. Lewis still running.

Ray Lewis all the

[Martz] Kurt, listen to me.

You know why I
was so hard on you?

1603
01:35:52.169 --> 01:35:54.171
Why I put all that pressure on you?

1604
01:35:54.254 --> 01:35:56.465
I had to know that you were ready.

1605

if I didn't fully believe
you were a champion.
