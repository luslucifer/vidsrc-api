1
00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.188
EVERY 350,000 YEARS,
THE COMET, BAY-LEDER 7,


2
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:38.192
PASSES EARTH SO CLOSELY, IT
CAN BE SEEN WITH THE NAKED EYE.


3
00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:39.660
TONIGHT, THE WAIT IS OVER.

4
00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:43.497
ASTRONOMERS ARE TELLING US THAT WE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE COMET...


5
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.167
YOU KNOW, DAD, MOST MEN
WHO ARE HAVING A HUGE PARTY,


6
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.136
THROWN IN THEIR HONOR, WOULD BE
AT THE PARTY ENJOYING IT


7
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.472
AND NOT STANDING ON THE BALCONY
LOOKING AT BIRDS.


8
00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:54.608
ANNA, BAY-LEDER 7 IS MAKING
ITS CLOSEST PATH TO EARTH,


9
00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:57.511
AND I'M WATCHING FROM A BALCONY,
NOT FROM A TELESCOPE.


10
00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:00.481
THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY
FOR DISCOVERING IT.


11
00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:01.549
- I DIDN'T DISCOVER IT.

12
00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:05.586
YEAH, THE INSTITUTE DID...
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.


13
00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.155
ECKER PUT THAT AWAY.

14
00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:13.394
Sergeant Parker,
it looks like we have


15
00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.429
a breach of security
on the third floor...


16
00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:17.398
two unidentified subjects.

17
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.435
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS PARKER.
I'M ON IT. OVER.


18
00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.171
BETWEEN THE INSTITUTE,
YOUR CHARITY WORK, AND POLITICS,


19
00:01:24.205 --> 00:01:26.540
IF YOU DON'T START
TAKING TIME TO RELAX,


20
00:01:26.574 --> 00:01:28.509
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
A HEART ATTACK,


21
00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:30.845
AND THEN THERE WILL BE
NO ONE AROUND YOU TO RUN IT.


22
00:01:30.878 --> 00:01:32.713
- YES, THERE WILL.
- WHO? ME?


23
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.218
THE STAFF LOVES YOU
AND RESPECTS YOU.


24
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:38.686
- WHAT ABOUT HINTZE?

25
00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.590
HINTZE IS A BRAVE MAN,
BUT HE HAS NO VISION.


26
00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:43.858
HE'S NOT LIKE YOU.

27
00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:46.827
- I JUST...

28
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:48.529
THEY KNOW, DAD.

29
00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:50.664
I'M NOT A LEADER.

30
00:01:50.698 --> 00:01:52.600
- YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED.

31
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.436
UH, EXCUSE ME, THIS AREA
IS RESERVED FOR EMBASSY STAFF.


32
00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.572
I'M SORRY. WE'RE JUST HAVING
A CLOSER LOOK AT THE COMET.


33
00:01:58.606 --> 00:01:59.707
I'M SORRY, DR. STARNDORF.
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS YOU.


34
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.775
UH, THIS IS CAPTAIN PARKER.
YEAH, I FOUND OUR STRAYS.


35
00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.545
IT'S DOCTOR STARNDORF AND HIS DAUGHTER.
- They're cleared.


36
00:02:04.578 --> 00:02:05.579
- YEAH, I'VE GOT IT. OVER.

37
00:02:05.613 --> 00:02:07.515
DR. STARNDORF, PLEASE,
STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.


38
00:02:07.548 --> 00:02:10.651
WHEN YOU'RE READY, I'LL
ESCORT YOU BACK TO THE PARTY.


39
00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:12.620
- UH, MISTER...?

40
00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.588
PARKER...
CAPTAIN TOM PARKER, SIR.


41
00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:16.457
SO, CAPTAIN PARKER,
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?


42
00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:19.460
I MEAN, THE BAY-LEDER
IS SO CLOSE FROM HERE


43
00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:20.461
AS IF I'M... I'M SORRY.

44
00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:21.495
STARNDORF.

45
00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:24.932
WHAT?

46
00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:28.469
BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

47
00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.471
YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
COME ON, ANNA.


48
00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.541
I'M SORRY.
- CERTAINLY, SIR.


49
00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:35.843
- GOODBYE, CAPTAIN PARKER.
- BYE-BYE.


50
00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:54.562
- Hello?

51
00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:55.596
- SANDRA PARKER?

52
00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.897
YES, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

53
00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:58.732
- OH, IT'S TOO BAD, YOU KNOW?

54
00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:01.635
I WAS EXPECTING A CALL
FROM MY SECRET LOVER.


55
00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.537
UH, NO, NO.

56
00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:05.639
I'M AFRAID HE'S BEING
TORTURED TO DEATH RIGHT NOW.


57
00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:06.941
- WELL, I GUESS THAT MEANS

58
00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:09.009
I'M GONNA JUST
GET MYSELF ANOTHER ONE.


59
00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:10.811
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH ME, HONEY.


60
00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:12.546
I'LL MAKE DO
WITH YOU THIS EVENING.


61
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.515
All right, I'm working.
I got to go.


62
00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:15.749
KISS THE PRINCESS FOR ME.

63
00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:18.519
YEAH, SHE'S JUST ABOUT
READY FOR BED.


64
00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:19.787
- ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.

65
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.855
- YOU TOO. BYE.

66
00:03:34.034 --> 00:03:35.836
SIR, OUR CALCULATIONS
WERE CORRECT...


67
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:36.971
UP UNTIL THREE HOURS AGO.

68
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:38.672
- WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME SOONER?

69
00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:39.974
YOU'RE MY
CHIEF ENGINEER, HINTZE.


70
00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:41.675
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A SYSTEM ERROR.


71
00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.544
THE BAY-LEDER'S TRAJECTORY
HAS CHANGED.


72
00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:45.613
- GRAVITATIONAL SPIKE FROM EARTH?

73
00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:46.814
- PROBABLY.

74
00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:47.881
IT LOOKS LIKE
AN IN-SPACE COLLISION


75
00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:49.683
WITH AN UNCHARTED ASTEROID...

76
00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:51.852
IT HIT IT HARD ENOUGH
TO PUSH IT OFF-COURSE.


77
00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:53.988
WHATEVER THIS IS,
THIS IS JUST GREAT.


78
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:56.724
OKAY, LET'S
RECALCULATE THE COURSE.


79
00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:00.761
- NO, NO, NO.

80
00:04:00.794 --> 00:04:03.430
NO, THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE.
- OH, MY GOD.


81
00:04:03.464 --> 00:04:04.632
- HOW MUCH TIME?

82
00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:11.538
GET NASA ALONG WITH
EVERY GOVERNMENT


83
00:04:11.572 --> 00:04:13.674
IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE
ON THE LINE.


84
00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:14.908
I SHALL CALL COLONEL WATERS.

85
00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:36.830
- HONEY?

86
00:04:36.864 --> 00:04:38.432
HONEY.

87
00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:40.768
HI. HI, SWEETHEART.

88
00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:45.806
- TELL ME THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

89
00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.541
- EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

90
00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:49.576
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
- YEAH.


91
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.912
- BE RIGHT BACK.
- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK, SWEETIE.


92
00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:59.887
GENTLEMEN, WE ARE ON
A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE TODAY.


93
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.689
- COLONEL, BELIEVE YOU, WE KNOW,

94
00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:03.490
BUT WE LITERALLY HAVE
ONLY ONE SHOT ON THIS.


95
00:05:03.524 --> 00:05:05.592
WE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE
A WATER PISTOL TO THE SUN.


96
00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:06.860
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IT'S GONNA WORK?


97
00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:09.663
REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE ONE
THAT WIPED OUT THE DINOSAURS,


98
00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:13.634
AND WE'RE TRYING TO STOP IT
WITH AN OVERSIZE MICROWAVE OVEN?


99
00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:14.935
NO, I DON'T
THINK IT'S GONNA WORK.


100
00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:17.805
NOW, LISTEN TO ME NOW,
"MR. HANSON," IS IT?


101
00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:19.606
- HINTZE.
- HINTZE.


102
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.675
YEAH, WELL, I WOULD NEVER
ENTRUST NATIONAL SECURITY


103
00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:23.477
TO A MICROWAVE OVEN.

104
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.646
SolStar-2 RESPONDING,
ADJUSTING, TARGETING.


105
00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:27.581
EMERGENCY BIRTH IN 30 SECONDS.

106
00:05:27.614 --> 00:05:30.517
GENTLEMEN, WE MAY BE
ABOUT TO SAVE THE WORLD TODAY.


107
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:31.919
- COLONEL, DO YOU PRAY?

108
00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:34.521
-20 SECONDS.
- NOT LATELY.


109
00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:35.789
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO START AGAIN.

110
00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:37.624
- THIS IS CRAZY.
- SHUT UP, HINTZE!


111
00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:41.795
THERE ARE THINGS
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.


112
00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:47.534
SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE, ZERO.


113
00:05:59.913 --> 00:06:01.715
WE'LL FLY OUT OF HERE
IN A COUPLE HOURS.


114
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:02.783
LET'S GET GOING.
- WHERE?


115
00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:05.119
THEY THINK
THE COMET'S GONNA HIT


116
00:06:05.152 --> 00:06:06.820
SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN RUSSIA,
SO SOUTH, I GUESS.


117
00:06:06.854 --> 00:06:08.789
OKAY, WELL,
THEN I GOT TO PACK.


118
00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:09.656
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

119
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.458
NO LUGGAGE...
THERE'S NO ROOM, OKAY?


120
00:06:11.492 --> 00:06:12.960
THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY BROADCAST.


121
00:06:12.993 --> 00:06:15.529
SCIENTISTS HAVE CONFIRMED
THAT THE COMET


122
00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:17.531
WILL IMPACT EARTH
SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN EUROPE


123
00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:18.665
WITHIN HOURS.

124
00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.768
CITIZENS HAVE BEEN ADVISED
TO EVACUATE...


125
00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.805
WE'RE GOING ON A LITTLE TRIP,
SWEETHEART.


126
00:06:29.743 --> 00:06:33.514
IN LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT
TO DESTROY THE COMET,


127
00:06:33.547 --> 00:06:37.751
A TOP-SECRET MICROWAVE-BEAM
WEAPON HAS APPARENTLY BEEN USED.


128
00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:40.854
IT APPEARS
THE WEAPON HAS FAILED.


129
00:06:40.888 --> 00:06:45.826
AT THIS BASE, ALONE, NO LESS
THAN 50 C-17 AND C-130 AIRCRAFT


130
00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:50.864
HAVE BEEN SENT TO CITIES LIKE
COPENHAGEN, OSLO, AND BERLIN


131
00:06:50.898 --> 00:06:53.534
TO EVACUATE AMERICAN PERSONNEL.

132
00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:58.872
FROM RAMSTEIN AIR FORCE BASE,
THIS IS JOHN ELKIN REPORTING.


133
00:07:58.932 --> 00:08:01.802
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES
SPEAK OF OVER 4 BILLION DEAD


134
00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:04.571
AND MOST OF NORTHERN EURASIA
BECOMING UNINHABITABLE,


135
00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:06.240
POSSIBLY
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.


136
00:08:06.273 --> 00:08:07.975
- YOU CAN'T SEE THE SUN ANYMORE.

137
00:08:08.008 --> 00:08:10.577
THE SKY IS PITCH BLACK
IN PRAGUE AT 2:00 P.M.


138
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:11.879
ANNA VOLKOVA FOR CTN BULGARIA.

139
00:08:11.912 --> 00:08:13.881
MAJOR INCIDENTS
OF LOOTING WERE REPORTED


140
00:08:13.914 --> 00:08:15.949
IN WARSAW, BERLIN,
DRESDEN, AND KIEV


141
00:08:15.983 --> 00:08:17.251
ONLY MINUTES AFTER THE IMPACT.

142
00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:18.685
- COMMUNICATION IN EUROPE

143
00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:20.921
IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED
TO SATELLITE CELLPHONES NOW,


144
00:08:20.954 --> 00:08:22.322
AND THEY'RE BECOMING
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT


145
00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:23.624
TO GET BATTERY POWER.

146
00:08:23.657 --> 00:08:24.758
- ...HAVE RELOCATED TO TANGIER.

147
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.027
U.N. OFFICIALS HAVE STATED
THAT THEY EXPECT


148
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.262
A NEW GOVERNING BODY
OF WHAT ONCE WAS EUROPE


149
00:08:28.295 --> 00:08:30.697
TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED
WITHIN DAYS NOW.


150
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:32.232
TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED
BELOW ZERO WITHIN HOURS,


151
00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:34.268
AND THE BLACK SNOW RESUMES
IN NUCLEAR FALLOUT.


152
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:35.903
THE CLOUD OVER CENTRAL EUROPE

153
00:08:35.936 --> 00:08:37.871
IS DEFLECTING

154
00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:39.673
- ..ICE AGE.

155
00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:42.009
ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS,
EARTH FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE


156
00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:43.377
AND A VERY LONG WINTER.

157
00:09:10.871 --> 00:09:12.906
COME ON, GET UP.

158
00:09:21.982 --> 00:09:23.917
NOW, THIS AREA
IS FOR DIPLOMATS ONLY, OKAY?


159
00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:25.886
YOU GUYS STAY HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.


160
00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.688
- WH
-WHY CAN'T WE COME WITH YOU?

161
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:29.856
I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF THIS SITUATION FIRST.


162
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.359
I'LL COME RIGHT BACK.
I PROMISE, OKAY?


163
00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:36.363
HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
SWEETIE. IT'S OKAY.


164
00:09:36.396 --> 00:09:39.933
YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

165
00:09:42.102 --> 00:09:43.770
- I need clearance now.

166
00:09:43.804 --> 00:09:44.972
Can you hear me?

167
00:09:45.005 --> 00:09:46.239
I need clearance.

168
00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:47.274
- NO! NO.

169
00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:48.909
FORGET CLEARANCE!

170
00:09:48.942 --> 00:09:53.413
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS PLANE
MOVING RIGHT NOW.


171
00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:01.888
- I CAN'T LEAVE.

172
00:10:01.922 --> 00:10:03.290
MY FATHER'S STILL HERE,
AND HE NEEDS ME.


173
00:10:03.323 --> 00:10:05.192
MS. STARNDORF,
YOUR FATHER MADE HIS DECISION.


174
00:10:05.225 --> 00:10:06.426
HE WANTS TO STAY.

175
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.061
HE MADE IT EQUALLY CLEAR
HE WANTS YOU OUT.


176
00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:09.896
- BUT YOU CAN'T LET ME GO!
- YES, I CAN.


177
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.732
- MS. STARNDORF! MS. STARNDORF!

178
00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:13.834
I'M SURE YOUR FATHER'S GONNA
CATCH A PLANE IN A DAY OR TWO


179
00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:15.202
WHEN HE SEES
THAT EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.


180
00:10:15.235 --> 00:10:16.937
I HAVE A DAUGHTER, MYSELF.

181
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.439
I'M SURE HE JUST WANTS
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SAFE.


182
00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:21.441
NOW, PLEASE...
PLEASE GET ON THE PLANE.


183
00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.143
- GOOD WORK, PARKER.

184
00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:25.379
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP
AND HELP ME CALM THE OTHERS.


185
00:10:25.412 --> 00:10:27.414
- SIR...

186
00:10:33.286 --> 00:10:35.222
- NOW, PARKER!

187
00:10:35.255 --> 00:10:37.257
THAT'S AN ORDER.

188
00:10:51.104 --> 00:10:52.072
- EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN,

189
00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:54.374
FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE
TO SIT DOWN, HOLD ON.


190
00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:56.943
Flight 210, you're clear
for immediate takeoff.


191
00:10:56.977 --> 00:10:58.945
Clear out of here
as quick as you can.


192
00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:00.380
We have major storms moving in.

193
00:11:00.414 --> 00:11:01.915
- OKAY, CLOSE IT UP.

194
00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:03.050
- PULL IT BACK!

195
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:09.456
- COLONEL, I NEED TO GET OFF THIS PLANE!
- IT'S TOO LATE.


196
00:11:09.489 --> 00:11:11.091
- N-NO, SIR, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND...
- YOU ARE TOO LATE.


197
00:11:11.124 --> 00:11:12.359
SIR, MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER
ARE OUT THERE.


198
00:11:12.392 --> 00:11:13.794
- THEY CAN GET ON THE NEXT PLANE.

199
00:11:13.827 --> 00:11:15.228
NOW YOU SIT DOWN,
AND THAT'S AN ORDER.


200
00:11:18.165 --> 00:11:20.200
- OKAY, PARKER!

201
00:11:20.233 --> 00:11:21.802
NOW, YOU'RE COMING ON THIS PLANE

202
00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:23.070
EITHER AS A PASSENGER
OR A CORPSE.


203
00:11:23.103 --> 00:11:25.338
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

204
00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:28.475
I'M GETTING OFF THIS PLANE
RIGHT NOW, COLONEL.


205
00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:34.481
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER YOURSELF
REALLY SPECIAL, PARKER.


206
00:11:34.514 --> 00:11:38.952
YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN WHO EVER
PULLED A GUN ON ME AND LIVED.


207
00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:40.887
- UNH!

208
00:12:56.997 --> 00:12:58.498
- WHAT THE HELL?s

209
00:12:58.532 --> 00:13:01.468
LOOKS LIKE ONE OF OUR OFFERS
JUST LET UP.


210
00:13:01.501 --> 00:13:05.238
THE SolStar-2 HAS JUST SWITCHED
FROM RED TO GREEN,


211
00:13:05.272 --> 00:13:06.473
I NEED YOU TO CHECK IT OUT.

212
00:13:06.506 --> 00:13:07.574
WHY?

213
00:13:07.607 --> 00:13:09.109
BECAUSE WE DON'
T HAVE THE CODES.

214
00:13:09.142 --> 00:13:10.443
IT CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED

215
00:13:10.477 --> 00:13:13.113
FROM ITS ORIGINAL
CONTROL CENTER IN BERLIN.


216
00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:15.949
LOOK, EITHER SOMEBODY'S
ALIVE OUT THERE


217
00:13:15.982 --> 00:13:18.451
OR SOME GENIUS
JUST RIPPED THE CODE.


218
00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:40.207
- SANDWICH?

219
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.608
- THANKS.

220
00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:43.176
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

221
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.444
I BARELY MADE IT OUT OF THERE
THREE YEARS AGO,


222
00:13:44.477 --> 00:13:46.246
AND NOW THEY'RE
SENDING US BACK IN.


223
00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:47.347
FOR WHAT?

224
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.250
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
FORGOT TO TURN THE LIGHTS OUT


225
00:13:50.283 --> 00:13:51.918
AT THE NLI INSTITUTE IN BERLIN.

226
00:13:51.952 --> 00:13:53.153
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

227
00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:55.188
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

228
00:13:55.222 --> 00:13:56.189
- YEP.
- DRAG.


229
00:13:56.223 --> 00:13:59.292
I WAS IN BERLIN
FOR TWO YEARS...


230
00:13:59.326 --> 00:14:00.927
WILD TOWN IN ITS DAY.

231
00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.242
- HEY, YOU FEEL THAT?

232
00:14:15.275 --> 00:14:17.711
- THE PLANE'S GETTING WARMER.

233
00:14:17.744 --> 00:14:19.179
- JESUS.

234
00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:21.248
SOMEBODY TELL THE PILOT
TO CUT THE HEAT.


235
00:14:25.252 --> 00:14:27.654
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.


236
00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:30.323
- RIGHT.

237
00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:36.696
CAPTAIN, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON IN HERE?


238
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.698
WE'RE ON FIRE BACK HERE.

239
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.666
THAT DOESN'T LOOK SO GOOD
NOW, DOES IT?


240
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:16.269
WANT TO CHECK IT OUT?

241
00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:23.343
MADAME PRESIDENT, IT WAS
A MICROWAVE BEAM FROM SolStar-2.


242
00:15:23.376 --> 00:15:25.378
BASICALLY,
THEY WERE FLASH-FRIED.


243
00:15:25.412 --> 00:15:28.481
AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT SolStar-2
IS ACTIVE AND UNDER CONTROL...


244
00:15:28.515 --> 00:15:29.749
ALBEIT HOSTILE CONTROL.

245
00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:32.285
WE LOST 18 MEN
TO FIND THAT OUT.


246
00:15:32.319 --> 00:15:33.186
I THOUGHT IT WAS ACCESSIBLE

247
00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:34.754
ONLY FROM
THE COMMAND CENTER IN BERLIN.


248
00:15:34.788 --> 00:15:36.423
THAT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DEATH ZONE.


249
00:15:36.456 --> 00:15:37.524
AND ACCORDING TO
OUR LATEST INTELLIGENCE


250
00:15:37.557 --> 00:15:39.292
FROM THE DEATH ZONE,
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY CONTACT THERE


251
00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:40.293
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

252
00:15:40.327 --> 00:15:42.529
I'D SAY WE HAVE
AN INTELLIGENCE FAILURE THEN.


253
00:15:42.562 --> 00:15:46.299
COLONEL, SolStar's
MICROWAVE BEAM


254
00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:48.268
PRESENTS A THREAT
TO ALL OUR AIRCRAFT.


255
00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:49.736
- THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

256
00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:51.338
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

257
00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:52.706
THE MICROWAVE BEAM
WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED


258
00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:54.708
TO BE TRANSMITTED
TO GROUND-RELAY STATIONS


259
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:56.242
AT A LOW LEVEL OF ENERGY.

260
00:15:56.276 --> 00:15:57.410
- AND?
- AT A HIGHER LEVEL,


261
00:15:57.444 --> 00:15:59.713
IT CAN BE DISCHARGED FROM
A SINGLE, CONCENTRATED BURST.


262
00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:02.582
- RESULTING IN...?
- MASSIVE WIDE-SCALE DESTRUCTION.


263
00:16:02.615 --> 00:16:05.185
SolStar-2 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN EXPERIMENTAL POWER STATION


264
00:16:05.218 --> 00:16:07.153
THAT WOULD GIVE HUMANITY
AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY


265
00:16:07.187 --> 00:16:09.522
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY END
OUR DEPENDANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS.


266
00:16:09.556 --> 00:16:11.257
THE MILITARY FUNDED
ITS DEVELOPMENT.


267
00:16:11.291 --> 00:16:13.426
WE NEEDED IT TO HAVE
SOME SORT OF WEAPON CAPACITY.


268
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.295
A WEAPON?

269
00:16:15.328 --> 00:16:18.164
EVEN YOUR BLACK OPS
HAVE BLACK OPS.


270
00:16:18.198 --> 00:16:20.333
ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?


271
00:16:20.367 --> 00:16:21.634
- SolStar-2 WAS CONSIDERED LOST.

272
00:16:21.668 --> 00:16:23.503
WE ASSUMED IT HAD BEEN
DAMAGED OR DESTROYED


273
00:16:23.536 --> 00:16:25.438
WHEN THE COMET ENTERED
THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.


274
00:16:25.472 --> 00:16:28.675
WE SAW NO NEED TO PUT
A DEAD PROJECT IN THE REPORT.


275
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:33.713
WELL, SOMEBODY OUT THERE
IS USING IT AGAINST US.


276
00:16:33.747 --> 00:16:35.749
ARE THERE ANY EXPERTS
WHO CAN HELP US?


277
00:16:35.782 --> 00:16:37.851
GREGOR STARNDORF
DESIGNED THE SATELLITE.


278
00:16:37.884 --> 00:16:40.387
HOWEVER, HE AND HIS
PROJECT SUPERVISOR, HINTZE,


279
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.522
REMAINED IN BERLIN
WHEN IT WAS EVACUATED.


280
00:16:42.555 --> 00:16:45.325
BUT HIS DAUGHTER, ANNA,
WHO ALSO WORKED ON THE PROJECT,


281
00:16:45.358 --> 00:16:47.394
DID GET OUT.

282
00:16:47.427 --> 00:16:49.195
- WHERE IS SHE NOW?

283
00:16:49.229 --> 00:16:51.798
- QUITO, ECUADOR, 
SOUTH AMERICA.

284
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:54.801
- I WANT HER BACK.
- YES, MA'AM.


285
00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.221
NO, NO.

286
00:17:15.255 --> 00:17:17.624
SI, SENORA.

287
00:17:17.657 --> 00:17:19.325
- YEP. YES, HELLO?

288
00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.262
TODAY?
NO, OUT OF THE QUESTION.


289
00:17:22.295 --> 00:17:24.764
I JUST...

290
00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:26.232
IT WHAT?

291
00:17:26.266 --> 00:17:29.636
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

292
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:31.304
YEAH, BYE.

293
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.228
- HEY
-HEY
-HEY, HEY, HEY.

294
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:56.262
- IT'S OKAY, OKAY?

295
00:17:56.296 --> 00:17:57.330
- LEAVE HER ALONE.

296
00:17:57.363 --> 00:17:59.432
THANK YOU.

297
00:17:59.466 --> 00:18:02.235
- ANNA STARNDORF?

298
00:18:02.268 --> 00:18:03.703
- DO I KNOW YOU?

299
00:18:03.736 --> 00:18:06.706
YEAH, UH, TOM PARKER...
USED TO BE "CAPTAIN TOM PARKER."


300
00:18:06.739 --> 00:18:08.541
I'M NO LONGER IN THE MILITARY.

301
00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:11.411
I MET YOU AT THE U.S. EMBASSY
IN BERLIN WITH YOUR FATHER.


302
00:18:11.444 --> 00:18:12.779
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

303
00:18:12.812 --> 00:18:14.514
SORRY,
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT.


304
00:18:14.547 --> 00:18:16.249
YEAH.

305
00:18:16.282 --> 00:18:18.351
SEEMS WE ONLY RUN INTO
EACH OTHER WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE.


306
00:18:18.384 --> 00:18:19.853
AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT
OF TROUBLE THE LAST THREE YEARS.


307
00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:21.821
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT DIFFICULT.

308
00:18:21.855 --> 00:18:23.556
- AND THIS IS YOUR FRIEND?

309
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.759
THIS... THIS IS SASQUATCH,
MY TRAVELING COMPANION.


310
00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:27.794
- OH, REALLY?

311
00:18:27.827 --> 00:18:29.596
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN TRAVELING?

312
00:18:29.629 --> 00:18:32.532
NORTH... ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO GET BACK TO BERLIN.


313
00:18:32.565 --> 00:18:33.900
- BUT THEY SAID THAT NO ONE...

314
00:18:33.933 --> 00:18:35.702
- WELL, NO ONE HAS.

315
00:18:35.735 --> 00:18:38.204
THERE HASN'T EVEN BEEN A RESCUE
MISSION IN THE LAST THREE YEARS.


316
00:18:38.238 --> 00:18:40.607
I'VE BEEN TRYING ALONE.

317
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.809
I KNOW THAT PROBABLY
SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT...


318
00:18:42.842 --> 00:18:44.944
NO-NO, NO-NO, NO,
IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.


319
00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:47.580
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE FANTASIZED


320
00:18:47.614 --> 00:18:50.316
ABOUT PACKING A BAG
AND HEADING OUT, YOU KNOW?


321
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.852
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN ECUADOR,


322
00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:55.989
SO A JOURNEY TO BERLIN
IS A LITTLE BIT OUT OF MY WAY.


323
00:18:56.022 --> 00:18:57.457
- ECUADOR?
- YEAH.


324
00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.659
I'M HELPING
TO FEED REFUGEES THERE.


325
00:18:59.692 --> 00:19:03.563
SO, AFTER BERLIN,
MY SPACE RESEARCH SEEMED TO...


326
00:19:03.596 --> 00:19:07.667
SPACE RESEARCH... THAT'S RIGHT.
YOUR FATHER DEVELOPED SolStar-2.


327
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.968
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

328
00:19:09.002 --> 00:19:11.704
SO, YOU'RE HERE
ABOUT THE PLANE CRASH.


329
00:19:11.738 --> 00:19:13.339
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

330
00:19:13.373 --> 00:19:15.608
IS THERE SOMEPLACE
THAT WE CAN SPEAK IN PRIVATE?


331
00:19:15.642 --> 00:19:18.278
- YEAH, COME WITH ME.

332
00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:30.523
- MS. STARNDORF,

333
00:19:30.557 --> 00:19:32.926
NORMALLY, WHEN YOU'RE CALLED
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT,


334
00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:36.296
THE SUMMONS IS FOR YOU ALONE...
NOT YOU AND A GUEST.


335
00:19:36.329 --> 00:19:37.764
- MY APOLOGIES.

336
00:19:37.797 --> 00:19:39.666
THIS IS TOM PARKER.

337
00:19:39.699 --> 00:19:41.601
HE USED TO WORK AT
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN.


338
00:19:41.634 --> 00:19:45.505
- AND HE'S HERE BECAUSE...?

339
00:19:45.538 --> 00:19:49.609
TWO DAYS AGO, UP NORTH, ONE
OF YOUR MILITARY JETS CRASHED.


340
00:19:49.642 --> 00:19:50.944
I SAW IT GO DOWN.

341
00:19:50.977 --> 00:19:52.612
- A TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

342
00:19:52.645 --> 00:19:55.415
- IT WAS NO ACCIDENT, MA'AM.

343
00:19:55.448 --> 00:19:57.650
YOU CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION
BY YOURSELF?


344
00:19:57.684 --> 00:19:59.652
- NO, MA'AM.

345
00:19:59.686 --> 00:20:04.490
I RECOVERED THE BLACK BOX.

346
00:20:06.659 --> 00:20:09.896
THIS DAMAGE OCCURRED
BEFORE THE PLANE BLEW UP.


347
00:20:09.929 --> 00:20:12.665
THE ONLY WEAPON THAT I KNOW THAT
COULD CAUSE THIS KIND OF DAMAGE


348
00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:15.702
IS A MICROWAVE-BEAM
WEAPON... SolStar-2.


349
00:20:15.735 --> 00:20:20.039
WHY DON'T I HAVE
PEOPLE LIKE YOU ON MY STAFF?


350
00:20:20.073 --> 00:20:21.941
I'D LIKE TO BE INCLUDED
ON THE EXPEDITION, MA'AM.


351
00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:23.710
- WHAT EXPEDITION?

352
00:20:23.743 --> 00:20:25.578
THE ONE THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEND
TO BERLIN TO INVESTIGATE.


353
00:20:25.612 --> 00:20:27.547
- THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

354
00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.983
COLONEL WATERS, I'M
THE MOST EXPERIENCED PERSON...


355
00:20:30.016 --> 00:20:32.018
LOOK, WHY DON'T I JUST HAVE YOU ARRESTED
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN'T GO?


356
00:20:32.051 --> 00:20:34.487
WHY DON'T YOU STICK A GUN IN
MY FACE LIKE YOU DID LAST TIME?


357
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.655
- THAT CAN BE ARRANGED, PARKER.

358
00:20:35.688 --> 00:20:38.625
EASE UP ON THE TESTOSTERONE,
GENTLEMEN.


359
00:20:38.658 --> 00:20:43.630
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO GO
BACK TO BERLIN, MR. PARKER?


360
00:20:43.663 --> 00:20:45.898
- PERSONAL REASONS, MA'AM.

361
00:20:45.932 --> 00:20:47.467
- HE'S RIGHT.

362
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.636
HE HAS ALREADY TRIED
TO GET THERE EIGHT TIMES.


363
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:51.938
HIS EXPERIENCE
COULD PROVE INVALUABLE.


364
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:55.475
CONSIDER YOURSELF DRAFTED,
MR. PARKER,


365
00:20:55.508 --> 00:20:56.976
BY THE N.U.N.S. GOVERNMENT.

366
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.512
IF YOU FORMALLY WORKED
FOR THE EMBASSY,


367
00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:01.981
I DON'T HAVE TO
REMIND YOU ABOUT SECURITY?


368
00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:03.116
- NO, MA'AM.

369
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:05.118
- THANK YOU, MR. PARKER.

370
00:21:05.151 --> 00:21:08.588
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL
YOU KNOW COLONEL WATERS,


371
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:10.623
BUT HE'LL BE
HEADING THIS MISSION.


372
00:21:10.657 --> 00:21:15.061
YOU'LL BE TAKING YOUR ORDERS
FROM HIM, IS THAT CLEAR?


373
00:21:15.094 --> 00:21:16.462
- YES, MA'AM.

374
00:21:18.698 --> 00:21:22.068
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE BETTER
BEHAVED THAN YOUR DOG,


375
00:21:22.101 --> 00:21:23.603
MR. PARKER.

376
00:21:25.438 --> 00:21:26.572
YES, MA'AM.

377
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.680
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT
I DON'T WANT YOU ON THIS TRIP,


378
00:21:33.713 --> 00:21:36.983
BUT I HAVE MY ORDERS
JUST LIKE LAST TIME.


379
00:21:37.016 --> 00:21:38.384
- AIN'T MUCH.

380
00:21:38.418 --> 00:21:39.752
- WHAT?

381
00:21:39.786 --> 00:21:41.988
A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS,
A COUPLE TRUCKS...


382
00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:44.624
I'D EXPECT A BIGGER CONVOY
FOR WHAT'S AT STAKE.


383
00:21:44.657 --> 00:21:46.859
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.


384
00:21:46.893 --> 00:21:48.995
THE UNITED STATES
HAVE US BY THE BALLS.


385
00:21:49.028 --> 00:21:50.997
WE NEED THEIR ALL
MORE THAN EVER NOW.


386
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.467
THIS IS SARAH HENLEY.
SHE'S EX-S.A.S. WITH THE BRITS.


387
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.035
SHE'S BEEN SELECTED
AS MY SECOND IN COMMAND,


388
00:21:56.069 --> 00:21:59.505
AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU WILL
FOLLOW HER INSTRUCTIONS


389
00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:01.507
EXACTLY THE SAME
AS YOU WOULD FOLLOW MINE.


390
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:02.709
YOU UNDERSTAND?

391
00:22:02.742 --> 00:22:04.510
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY
I'D FOLLOW YOURS.


392
00:22:04.544 --> 00:22:06.512
- HM.
- SURE. SURE.


393
00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:08.047
- IT'S NOT ALL CHEER.

394
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:10.683
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

395
00:22:10.717 --> 00:22:12.785
- I BET YOU CAN.

396
00:22:12.819 --> 00:22:15.021
- CATCH YOU LATER.

397
00:22:45.852 --> 00:22:47.086
IT MAKES YOU WONDER,
DOESN'T IT?


398
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.493
WE ONLY GET THAT
ON NATIONAL HOLIDAYS


399
00:22:53.526 --> 00:22:55.495
AND BEFORE A DANGEROUS MISSION.

400
00:23:07.607 --> 00:23:09.809
DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU WANT
TO TAKE EVERYTHING YOU CAN GET


401
00:23:09.842 --> 00:23:11.677
BEFORE YOU LEAVE?

402
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:15.748
I GUESS THAT WOULD DEPEND ON
WHAT I COULD GET.


403
00:23:49.949 --> 00:23:51.517
THAT WAS GOOD.

404
00:24:08.935 --> 00:24:11.871
- LADIES, GENTLEMEN... PRESIDENT.

405
00:24:22.982 --> 00:24:24.851
MADAME PRESIDENT,
WE'RE SET TO GO.


406
00:24:24.884 --> 00:24:28.821
4 MILLION, WATERS...
REMEMBER THAT NUMBER.


407
00:24:28.855 --> 00:24:30.857
- EXCUSE ME?

408
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.926
Space research lab's registered
a shift in SolStar's position.


409
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.962
According to their calculations,

410
00:24:35.995 --> 00:24:39.799
It's targeting pretty much
the ground we're standing on.


411
00:24:39.832 --> 00:24:41.767
If their estimates are right,

412
00:24:41.801 --> 00:24:43.970
it'll be ready to fire
in 48 hours.


413
00:24:44.003 --> 00:24:49.842
IF IT DOES,
FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE COULD DIE.


414
00:24:49.876 --> 00:24:52.945
GOD SPEED TO YOU ALL.

415
00:24:52.979 --> 00:24:56.916
OKAY, PEOPLE, WE HAVE
A DEADLINE... 48 HOURS.


416
00:24:56.949 --> 00:24:58.084
LET'S MOVE.

417
00:25:15.801 --> 00:25:17.003
EVERYBODY IN THE TRUCKS.

418
00:25:17.036 --> 00:25:18.337
PREPARE TO DROP.

419
00:25:23.876 --> 00:25:26.045
- THANKS FOR TH...

420
00:25:26.078 --> 00:25:29.315
WHOA.

421
00:25:29.348 --> 00:25:31.284
- TOM?

422
00:25:31.317 --> 00:25:33.819
TOM, IT'S TIME TO...

423
00:25:33.853 --> 00:25:36.689
OH. WE'RE FLYING SO LOW.

424
00:25:36.722 --> 00:25:38.991
- ANY LOWER, WE'D BE DRIVING.

425
00:25:39.025 --> 00:25:41.027
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ONCE LIVED HERE.


426
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.030
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS.


427
00:25:44.063 --> 00:25:46.265
IF THINGS STAY THE SAME
FOR A WHILE,


428
00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:50.236
LIFE TRICKS US INTO BELIEVING
THAT THEY ALWAYS WILL BE.


429
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:52.772
- TOM, CAN I TRUST YOU?

430
00:25:52.805 --> 00:25:54.273
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

431
00:25:54.307 --> 00:25:57.843
YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR A PERSONAL REASON, SO AM I.


432
00:25:57.877 --> 00:25:59.412
THEY THINK THAT MY DAD IS ALIVE

433
00:25:59.445 --> 00:26:02.081
AND HE'S IN CONTROL
OF THE SATELLITE.


434
00:26:04.016 --> 00:26:05.217
- WELL, WHAT IF HE IS?

435
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:08.321
- MY FATHER DIED IN BERLIN.

436
00:26:08.354 --> 00:26:12.792
WELL, WHAT IF, FOR
WHATEVER REASON, HE DIDN'T DIE


437
00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:14.026
AND HE IS IN CONTROL
OF THE SATELLITE?


438
00:26:15.995 --> 00:26:17.997
- I DON'T KNOW.

439
00:26:20.366 --> 00:26:23.169
- THEN I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES.

440
00:26:23.202 --> 00:26:25.037
- WHEN HE WAS LITTLE,

441
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:27.273
HIS PARENTS STAYED IN BERLIN
DURING WORLD WAR II.


442
00:26:27.306 --> 00:26:30.042
IT WAS ONCE SUCH A VIBRANT,
EXCITING CITY,


443
00:26:30.076 --> 00:26:31.243
BUT THE WAR DESTROYED IT.

444
00:26:31.277 --> 00:26:33.279
WHEN IT WAS OVER,
THEY STAYED, REBUILT,


445
00:26:33.312 --> 00:26:36.048
AND TURNED THE PILE OF RUBBLE
INTO A CITY AGAIN,


446
00:26:36.082 --> 00:26:37.950
EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE.

447
00:26:37.984 --> 00:26:41.020
HE ALWAYS SAID,
"BERLIN IS LIKE A WIFE.


448
00:26:41.053 --> 00:26:44.423
YOU STICK WITH HER
IN GOOD TIMES AND IN BAD."


449
00:26:44.457 --> 00:26:48.094
SO, HE AND HIS ASSISTANTS
STAYED BEHIND.


450
00:26:48.127 --> 00:26:49.862
- BRAVE GUYS?

451
00:26:49.895 --> 00:26:52.898
NOT BRAVE... STUPID.

452
00:26:52.932 --> 00:26:55.134
THEY SAY BRAVERY AND STUPIDITY
ARE CLOSE FRIENDS.


453
00:26:55.167 --> 00:27:00.106
ONLY THE RESULT
SEPARATES THE TWO.


454
00:27:00.139 --> 00:27:02.942
AND NOW YOU CAN SEE WHY I KNOW
MY FATHER'S INNOCENT.


455
00:27:02.975 --> 00:27:04.977
HE'S SEEN TOO MUCH
DESTRUCTION IN HIS LIFE


456
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:06.412
TO CAUSE ANY, HIMSELF.

457
00:27:06.445 --> 00:27:08.914
HEY, LOOK.

458
00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:18.124
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO PARIS?

459
00:27:18.157 --> 00:27:19.959
- MY HONEYMOON.

460
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.362
- SEE YOU ON THE GROUND.

461
00:27:46.185 --> 00:27:48.120
TRUCK TWO, DO YOU READ ME?

462
00:27:48.154 --> 00:27:49.188
- This is truck two.

463
00:27:49.221 --> 00:27:50.956
We're good.

464
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:55.061
OKAY, SYSTEM CHECKED,
EVERYTHING IN THE GREEN.


465
00:27:59.165 --> 00:28:02.101
WHEN THE SATELLITE
STARTS TURNING, THEN WE DROP.


466
00:28:02.134 --> 00:28:03.936
YOU WANT TO WAIT
UNTIL SolStar-2 IS READY


467
00:28:03.969 --> 00:28:05.137
TO FIRE ON US?
- THE PLANE'S EXPENDABLE.


468
00:28:05.171 --> 00:28:06.172
- BUT WE ARE NOT EXPENDABLE.

469
00:28:06.205 --> 00:28:08.941
IT'S A NECESSARY RISK
IF WE'RE GONNA CONVINCE


470
00:28:08.974 --> 00:28:10.176
WHOEVER'S IN CONTROL
OF THAT SATELLITE


471
00:28:10.209 --> 00:28:11.510
THAT THEY'VE DESTROYED US.

472
00:28:16.949 --> 00:28:18.184
- YOU DON'T LIKE WATERS.

473
00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:19.185
- DO I HAVE TO?

474
00:28:19.218 --> 00:28:20.352
- WHAT ABOUT THE STARNDORF GIRL?

475
00:28:20.386 --> 00:28:22.188
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

476
00:28:22.221 --> 00:28:24.857
- YOU SEEM TO KNOW HER.

477
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.025
- FROM ANOTHER LIFE, YEAH.

478
00:28:26.058 --> 00:28:27.927
PEOPLE ALWAYS USE THAT
EXPRESSION, "FROM ANOTHER LIFE,"


479
00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.095
WHEN REFERRING TO
BEFORE THE IMPACT.


480
00:28:29.128 --> 00:28:30.196
I THINK IT'S BULLOCKS.

481
00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:31.931
IT'S THE SAME LIFE.

482
00:28:31.964 --> 00:28:33.365
I WAS A SOLDIER BEFORE...
I'M A SOLDIER NOW.


483
00:28:33.399 --> 00:28:35.000
A COMET CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

484
00:28:36.135 --> 00:28:37.303
- I GUESS NOT.

485
00:28:38.904 --> 00:28:40.873
- THE SATELLITE IS TURNING.
- HOW LONG?


486
00:28:40.906 --> 00:28:42.341
-20 SECONDS.

487
00:28:48.147 --> 00:28:52.051
- OKAY, EVERYONE, STRAP IN.

488
00:28:52.084 --> 00:28:54.086
IT'S GOT A LOCK ON US.
WE NEED TO DROP.


489
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.354
- NOT YET.
- IT'S POWERING UP.


490
00:28:55.387 --> 00:28:58.991
EVERY SECOND WE SPEND UP HERE
IS AN HOUR LESS ON THE GROUND.


491
00:28:59.024 --> 00:28:59.959
ON MY MARK...

492
00:28:59.992 --> 00:29:03.062
MICROWAVE BEAM... WE'RE HIT.

493
00:29:05.464 --> 00:29:09.201
COLONEL WATERS, WE NEED TO GET
OUT OF THIS PLANE RIGHT NOW.


494
00:29:09.235 --> 00:29:12.104
THE LAST PLANE
TOOK 40 SECONDS BEFORE IT BLEW.


495
00:29:12.138 --> 00:29:13.072
- THIS IS INSANE.

496
00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:15.040
- NO, NO, NO. IT'S A RISK.

497
00:29:15.074 --> 00:29:17.076
SOMETIMES, IN ORDER
TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS,


498
00:29:17.109 --> 00:29:19.979
WE HAVE TO TAKE RISKS THAT OTHER
PEOPLE MIGHT SEE AS INSANE.


499
00:29:20.012 --> 00:29:20.980
DO YOU KNOW WHO SAID THAT?

500
00:29:21.013 --> 00:29:23.182
- MY FATHER.
- THAT'S RIGHT.


501
00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:28.921
INITIATE DROP.

502
00:29:47.239 --> 00:29:50.376
SHOOT DEPLOYMENT
IN FIVE SECONDS.


503
00:29:53.112 --> 00:29:54.980
FOUR...

504
00:29:55.014 --> 00:29:57.049
THREE...TWO...

505
00:29:57.082 --> 00:29:58.083
ONE.

506
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.225
SHOOT DEPLOYED.

507
00:30:08.227 --> 00:30:10.996
OKAY, EVERYONE, HOLD TIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE A ROUGH LANDING.


508
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.264
- GREAT.

509
00:30:12.298 --> 00:30:15.134
WELL, CERTAINLY BEATS TRYING
TO GET TO BERLIN ON SNOWSHOES.


510
00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:16.168
- DON'T KNOCK IT TILL YOU TRY IT.

511
00:30:16.202 --> 00:30:17.670
- HM, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE.

512
00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:19.271
- TRIED EIGHT TIMES.

513
00:30:21.106 --> 00:30:23.175
I GET EVERYTHING I WANT
THE FIRST TIME I TRY.


514
00:30:23.209 --> 00:30:25.077
I WOULD NEVER
TRY ANYTHING EIGHT TIMES.


515
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.345
WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING?

516
00:30:26.378 --> 00:30:28.347
A PROMISE.
WHY DO YOU KEEP GOING?


517
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.184
MY ORDERS...
THAT'S KIND OF A PROMISE, TOO.


518
00:30:32.218 --> 00:30:33.285
HERE WE GO.

519
00:30:46.265 --> 00:30:48.300
- IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

520
00:30:48.334 --> 00:30:50.069
- THAT WASN'T SO BAD.

521
00:30:50.102 --> 00:30:51.637
- EXACTLY WHERE ARE WE?

522
00:30:53.439 --> 00:30:55.708
NEAR THE FORMER
FRENCH-BELGIUM BORDER.


523
00:30:55.741 --> 00:30:58.544
OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE'S
NEGATIVE... 52T CELSIUS.


524
00:30:58.577 --> 00:31:00.279
- OKAY, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

525
00:31:00.312 --> 00:31:02.114
TRUCK TWO, WE TAKE THE LEAD.

526
00:31:02.147 --> 00:31:03.582
- THIS IS TRUCK TWO.

527
00:31:03.616 --> 00:31:05.451
ROGER THAT, TRUCK ONE.

528
00:31:24.103 --> 00:31:25.738
AH, THIS DAMN TWILIGHT.
I CAN'T SEE A THING.


529
00:31:25.771 --> 00:31:27.706
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
DOES IT GET ANY BETTER?


530
00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.642
- NOPE.

531
00:31:29.675 --> 00:31:32.177
GONNA BE DIFFICULT TO DO
THE WEATHER FORECAST OUT HERE.


532
00:31:32.211 --> 00:31:36.181
YEAH, EVERY DAY'S
CLOUDY AND COLD... THAT'S IT.


533
00:31:50.729 --> 00:31:52.298
- YOU SEE?

534
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:55.000
THE WEATHER'S STABLE,
BUT THE GROUND ISN'T.


535
00:31:55.034 --> 00:31:57.469
THAT COMET CAUSED SOME SORT
OF PROBLEM WITH THE MAGMA FLOW.


536
00:31:57.503 --> 00:32:00.105
PEOPLE THINK THAT EUROPE'S
GONNA BREAK APART.


537
00:32:00.139 --> 00:32:01.206
AS LONG AS IT
HOLDS UP LONG ENOUGH


538
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.243
FOR US TO GET OUR ASSES
OUT OF HERE, I DON'T CARE.


539
00:32:11.283 --> 00:32:12.618
WHAT WAS THAT?
- ICE GEYSER.


540
00:32:12.651 --> 00:32:14.720
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
UNDERNEATH THE ICE.


541
00:32:14.753 --> 00:32:16.188
- YEAH, YOU'RE TELLING ME.

542
00:32:16.221 --> 00:32:18.490
WHY DON'T YOU AND PARKER
GET SOME REST.


543
00:32:18.524 --> 00:32:20.159
Let Scott drive.

544
00:32:20.192 --> 00:32:22.494
- YOU WANT TO GET SOME REST?

545
00:32:24.229 --> 00:32:27.566
SORRY, SOMEBODY DOESN'T THINK
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.


546
00:33:09.708 --> 00:33:11.377
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU MEAN "DETOUR"?


547
00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:12.845
According to
David Crockett, here,


548
00:33:12.878 --> 00:33:15.080
we've got to be very careful
crossing the river.


549
00:33:15.114 --> 00:33:16.348
- THE GROUND'S FROZEN SOLID.

550
00:33:16.382 --> 00:33:18.117
IT'LL EASILY TAKE
THE WEIGHT OF TWO TRUCKS.


551
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.619
THE GROUND OVER THE RIVER
IS EXTREMELY JAGGED


552
00:33:20.652 --> 00:33:22.321
AND COMPLETELY UNSTABLE.

553
00:33:22.354 --> 00:33:25.357
The bridges are intact.
I say we use one of those.


554
00:33:25.391 --> 00:33:28.627
FOR GOD'S SAKE, PARKER,
YOU KNOW TIME'S OF THE ESSENCE.


555
00:33:34.767 --> 00:33:36.702
OKAY. OKAY.

556
00:33:36.735 --> 00:33:38.337
WHICH ONE'S THE NEAREST?

557
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.772
WEILER, COLOGNE

558
00:33:39.805 --> 00:33:42.174
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BRIDGES
IN THIS CITY.


559
00:33:42.207 --> 00:33:43.208
- PICK ONE.

560
00:33:43.242 --> 00:33:45.244
- TARGET THE COLOGNE CATHEDRAL.

561
00:33:45.277 --> 00:33:47.212
The Deutzer Bridge
should be right next to it.


562
00:33:47.246 --> 00:33:49.381
WE HAVE THE CATHEDRAL
ON OUR SCANNERS.


563
00:33:49.415 --> 00:33:51.550
IT'S ONLY FEW MILES
OUT OF OUR WAY.


564
00:33:51.583 --> 00:33:53.152
COLOGNE...

565
00:33:53.185 --> 00:33:55.187
I WENT THERE WHEN I WAS A KID...
GREAT CARNIVAL.


566
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.123
YEAH, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE
MISSED THAT CARNIVAL OF YOURS.


567
00:34:12.805 --> 00:34:15.140
Okay.

568
00:34:15.174 --> 00:34:16.642
LET'S DO THIS.

569
00:34:16.675 --> 00:34:18.544
THE SOONER I GET OVER THERE,
THE HAPPIER I'M GONNA BE.


570
00:34:18.577 --> 00:34:19.878
TRUCK TWO, YOU TAKE THE LEAD.

571
00:34:19.912 --> 00:34:21.246
- ROGER THAT, COLONEL.

572
00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.848
TAKE THIS SLOW AND CAREFUL.

573
00:34:22.881 --> 00:34:25.818
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE GONNA
COME UP AGAINST, ALL RIGHT?


574
00:34:39.698 --> 00:34:41.700
IT LOOKS LIKE
LEVEL ICE UP AHEAD.


575
00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:44.570
PICK UP THE SPEED, PARKER.

576
00:34:44.603 --> 00:34:46.405
- NO
-NO, NO
-NO, NO
-NO.

577
00:34:50.943 --> 00:34:53.178
- Come on, Parker! Faster!

578
00:34:53.212 --> 00:34:54.847
- I WOULDN'T ADVISE THAT, SIR.

579
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.417
WELL, YOUR ADVICE HAS BEEN
NOTED AND IS DULY BEING IGNORED.


580
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.486
GIVE ME
SOME MORE SPEED, MALONEY.


581
00:35:04.623 --> 00:35:07.559
THAT IDIOT'S GONNA
GET US KILLED.


582
00:35:07.593 --> 00:35:09.728
OKAY, GIVE HIM SOME SPACE.

583
00:35:24.977 --> 00:35:26.745
SHIT.

584
00:35:26.778 --> 00:35:28.914
COLONEL, ARE YOU OKAY?
IS EVERYBODY OKAY IN THERE?


585
00:36:33.745 --> 00:36:35.614
- BRACE YOURSELVES!

586
00:36:35.647 --> 00:36:38.517
WHEN THIS THING GOES,
IT'S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE!


587
00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:41.553
PARKER!

588
00:36:41.587 --> 00:36:43.689
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET YOURSELF KILLED?!


589
00:36:43.722 --> 00:36:45.691
NO, SIR, JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.


590
00:36:45.724 --> 00:36:47.559
HERE CATCH THE ROPE.

591
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.478
- LADIES FIRST, MS. STARNDORF.

592
00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:07.379
- I CAN'T. I FALL.

593
00:37:07.412 --> 00:37:09.581
I GOT HER, COLONEL.
YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.


594
00:37:09.615 --> 00:37:10.782
- OKAY.

595
00:37:17.856 --> 00:37:19.057
- BETTER HOLD ONTO ME.

596
00:37:19.091 --> 00:37:21.693
I GOT YOU,
I GOT YOU.


597
00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.602
HOLD ONTO ME. HOLD ONTO ME!

598
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:34.706
JUST SLOWING YOU DOWN.

599
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.874
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

600
00:37:35.907 --> 00:37:37.075
IT'S OKAY. I GOT YOU.

601
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:38.910
SEE? TOLD YOU. ALL RIGHT.

602
00:37:38.944 --> 00:37:42.681
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT
WE'RE ALL ABOUT TO BE KILLED!


603
00:37:42.714 --> 00:37:45.617
SO GIVE HER A HAND, HENLEY!
HELP ME OUT!


604
00:37:45.651 --> 00:37:47.753
OKAY, ANNA, WE... HERE WE GO.

605
00:38:03.568 --> 00:38:05.704
- GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

606
00:38:17.849 --> 00:38:19.484
- WHERE IS PARKER?

607
00:38:19.518 --> 00:38:21.019
- I DIDN'T SEE HIM GET OFF.

608
00:38:27.659 --> 00:38:29.661
AAAAH!

609
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:42.708
LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

610
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:58.857
- BLOODY HELL, WHAT NOW?
- WHAT IS IT?


611
00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.593
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE BROKE
THE FRONT AXLE ON THE LAST RUN.


612
00:39:01.626 --> 00:39:02.661
- DO WE NEED TO FIX IT?
- YEAH, WE DO.


613
00:39:02.694 --> 00:39:04.663
UNLESS WE WANT TO TRAVEL
TO BERLIN ON A TURBO SLED.


614
00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:06.698
IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE
ABOUT AN HOUR.


615
00:39:06.732 --> 00:39:08.867
TOBIN, SCOTT, CAN YOU GET ON IT?
- COME ON, GUYS. GET A MOVE ON.


616
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:12.804
PARKER, THAT WAS A CRAZY STUNT
YOU PULLED BACK THERE.


617
00:39:12.838 --> 00:39:13.905
THANKS.

618
00:39:13.939 --> 00:39:16.641
- YEAH, SURE.

619
00:39:16.675 --> 00:39:19.745
UH, I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE
AND GET SOME FRESH AIR.


620
00:39:19.778 --> 00:39:21.680
- CAN I COME WITH YOU?

621
00:39:21.713 --> 00:39:23.048
- YEAH, SURE.

622
00:39:29.588 --> 00:39:31.757
- I WANTED TO THANK YOU, TOO.

623
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.793
NO, I'M HAPPY
TO HAVE THE COMPANY.


624
00:39:34.826 --> 00:39:36.828
- NO...FOR SAVING MY LIFE.

625
00:39:36.862 --> 00:39:38.597
THAT WAS VERY BRAVE.

626
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.766
- BRAVE OR STUPID?

627
00:39:40.799 --> 00:39:42.834
I GUESS I'M NOT
GOOD UNDER STRESS.


628
00:39:42.868 --> 00:39:44.970
WELL, YOU GET BETTER
WITH PRACTICE.


629
00:39:45.003 --> 00:39:46.738
SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS TRIP...

630
00:39:46.772 --> 00:39:48.807
WE'RE GONNA GET
PLENTY OF PRACTICE.


631
00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.776
WHAT'S THAT?

632
00:40:03.088 --> 00:40:07.025
IT'S PRETTY CLEVER...
DOESN'T NEED ANY BATTERIES,


633
00:40:07.058 --> 00:40:11.563
WON'T EVER FREEZE, KEEPS MAKING
NOISE NIGHT AND DAY.


634
00:40:11.596 --> 00:40:14.833
DO YOU THINK THERE IS
SOMEONE IN THERE?


635
00:40:14.866 --> 00:40:19.571
NO, NO, BUT MAYBE THERE'S
SOME CLUES AS TO WHEN THEY LEFT.


636
00:40:19.604 --> 00:40:20.906
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

637
00:40:52.804 --> 00:40:55.073
THESE PEOPLE
TRIED TO FIGHT THE COLD.


638
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.639
- THEY DIDN'T LEAVE.

639
00:41:35.947 --> 00:41:41.019
HOPEFULLY, THEY DIDN'T
SUFFER TOO MUCH.


640
00:41:41.052 --> 00:41:44.990
I HEAR IT DOESN'T EVEN HURT.

641
00:41:45.023 --> 00:41:49.728
DO YOU THINK THEY...
YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTER...


642
00:41:49.761 --> 00:41:51.963
ARE STILL WAITING FOR YOU?

643
00:41:51.997 --> 00:41:55.800
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
THAT THEY ARE.


644
00:42:02.407 --> 00:42:04.809
WE BETTER GET GOING.

645
00:42:48.053 --> 00:42:49.120
- HOW'S IT LOOK?

646
00:42:49.154 --> 00:42:51.690
THE CITY IS BURIED
UNDER 20 METERS OF ICE AND SNOW.


647
00:42:51.723 --> 00:42:52.791
- ANY SIGN OF LIFE?

648
00:42:52.824 --> 00:42:54.025
- NONE SO FAR.

649
00:42:54.059 --> 00:42:55.760
I'LL PLOT A COURSE
FOR THE INSTITUTE.


650
00:42:55.794 --> 00:42:57.862
NO. NO, DESPITE WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT YOUR FATHER,


651
00:42:57.896 --> 00:43:00.231
THERE MAY BE PEOPLE OUT THERE
WHO ARE WILLING TO DO US HARM.


652
00:43:00.265 --> 00:43:01.700
WE'LL RECON FROM HERE.

653
00:43:01.733 --> 00:43:03.268
- I CAN CHECK
IT OUT ON THE SLED.

654
00:43:03.301 --> 00:43:05.770
- YOU WOULDN'T COME BACK.
- AND WHY IS THAT?


655
00:43:05.804 --> 00:43:07.305
BECAUSE ALL YOU WANTED
WAS TO GET TO BERLIN.


656
00:43:07.339 --> 00:43:09.174
HOW CAN I TRUST YOU
TO COME BACK?


657
00:43:09.207 --> 00:43:11.776
YOU KNOW, THE SLED DOES
ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEATS.


658
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:12.844
I COULD GO WITH HIM.

659
00:43:12.877 --> 00:43:14.245
I MEAN, HE DOES KNOW THE CITY.

660
00:43:14.279 --> 00:43:16.915
- BE MY GUEST.

661
00:43:16.948 --> 00:43:17.916
- FINE.

662
00:43:17.949 --> 00:43:20.752
- OKAY, SECURE THE PERIMETER.

663
00:43:20.785 --> 00:43:22.354
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

664
00:43:22.387 --> 00:43:23.755
- I WANT TO HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

665
00:43:23.788 --> 00:43:24.422
IT'S MY HOME TOWN, REMEMBER?

666
00:43:24.456 --> 00:43:25.557
- UH, NO, NO, NO.

667
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.325
IT'S A WAR ZONE NOW,
AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE YOU.


668
00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:29.861
YOUR JOB STARTS
ONCE WE SECURE THE INSTITUTE.


669
00:43:29.894 --> 00:43:31.363
HEY, HEY,
TAKE IT EASY, COLONEL.


670
00:43:31.396 --> 00:43:33.832
- DON'T TELL ME TO TAKE IT EASY!

671
00:43:33.865 --> 00:43:37.168
NOTHING'S GONNA JEOPARDIZE
THIS MISSION, YOU UNDERSTAND?


672
00:43:37.202 --> 00:43:40.038
SAS, SAS.

673
00:43:42.907 --> 00:43:45.010
STAY WITH THE NICE LADY.

674
00:43:45.043 --> 00:43:48.446
KEEP HER COMPANY
TILL I GET BACK.


675
00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.684
OH, DON'T WORRY.
HE DOESN'T BITE...USUALLY.


676
00:44:20.145 --> 00:44:22.914
DO YOU MIND PUTTING
THE GUN AWAY, PLEASE?


677
00:44:22.947 --> 00:44:25.483
LET'S JUST CALL IT
MY INSURANCE POLICY.


678
00:44:25.517 --> 00:44:27.352
- OKAY.

679
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:53.278
- WHAT, YOU LIVED HERE FOR YEARS?

680
00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:56.214
YEAH, WELL, I DID MOST
OF MY DRIVING AROUND


681
00:44:56.247 --> 00:44:58.450
AND WALKING AROUND
ON STREET LEVEL.


682
00:45:00.351 --> 00:45:03.188
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT HILL.

683
00:45:03.221 --> 00:45:05.023
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

684
00:45:22.107 --> 00:45:23.508
- DO YOU HAVE TO DO THAT?

685
00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:25.276
- HEY, I JUST SAVED OUR LIVES.

686
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.245
LEAST YOU COULD DO IS BE POLITE.

687
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.415
- OH, MY GOD.

688
00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.140
ARE THOSE LIGHTS OVER THERE?

689
00:45:55.173 --> 00:45:56.207
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

690
00:45:56.241 --> 00:45:58.176
THEY USE A LOT OF MIRRORS INSIDE

691
00:45:58.209 --> 00:45:59.878
SO THAT THE SUN
WAS SHINING ON PARLIAMENT.


692
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:02.347
YEAH, ALL RIGHT, PROFESSOR...
FASCINATING HISTORY LESSON.


693
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.548
I THINK WE SHOULD GET GOING.

694
00:46:03.581 --> 00:46:04.849
IT'S GONNA GET DARK SOON.

695
00:46:10.522 --> 00:46:12.590
- I DON'T SEE ANYBODY.

696
00:46:16.928 --> 00:46:18.129
GET INSIDE!

697
00:46:18.163 --> 00:46:19.597
HENLEY, LET'S GO!

698
00:46:40.685 --> 00:46:42.887
- JESUS. THEY'RE UNDER ATTACK.

699
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.196
THEY'RE SITTING DUCKS
RIGHT THERE.


700
00:46:51.229 --> 00:46:52.197
WHY DON'T THEY MOVE?

701
00:46:56.334 --> 00:46:58.469
OH, MY GOD.

702
00:47:05.543 --> 00:47:07.612
- Parker, get out of there!

703
00:47:07.645 --> 00:47:10.315
- COLONEL WATERS, YOU'RE ALIVE?

704
00:47:10.348 --> 00:47:13.117
We're about 200 meters ahead
behind the building.


705
00:47:13.151 --> 00:47:15.253
They've seen us.
Get out of the sled!


706
00:47:34.439 --> 00:47:36.241
- WHAT HAPPENED?!

707
00:47:36.274 --> 00:47:38.676
WE CAME OUT, THEY SAW US,
SO WE EVAC-ED THE TRUCK.


708
00:47:40.612 --> 00:47:42.413
- ANY CASUALTIES?

709
00:47:42.447 --> 00:47:44.449
RICH DIDN'T MAKE IT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?


710
00:47:44.482 --> 00:47:46.451
SAME AS YOU...
WE CAME UNDER FIRE.


711
00:47:46.484 --> 00:47:49.187
WELL, THIS EXPEDITION'S TURNED
INTO A MILITARY CONFLICT.


712
00:47:50.088 --> 00:47:51.689
WE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE! LET'S GO!


713
00:47:51.723 --> 00:47:53.691
- OKAY, GO
-O
-O
-O!

714
00:48:21.352 --> 00:48:22.587
- TOM, LOOK!
- WHAT IS IT?


715
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.356
- I DON'T KNOW... RIGHT THERE.

716
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.158
- IT'S A TUNNEL!
- WELL, LET'S GO DIG THAT.


717
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.693
ELLISON, TAKE POINT!

718
00:48:28.726 --> 00:48:31.262
- SAS, COME HERE, BOY.

719
00:48:31.296 --> 00:48:32.263
COME HERE.

720
00:50:40.158 --> 00:50:42.226
- IT'S A LOT WARMER DOWN HERE.

721
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.528
WHAT'S THAT?

722
00:50:48.433 --> 00:50:51.569
- IT'S STILL WARM.

723
00:50:53.438 --> 00:50:54.505
WHAT IS IT, SAS?
WHAT IS IT, BOY, HUH?


724
00:50:56.741 --> 00:50:59.377
GO!

725
00:51:16.394 --> 00:51:18.196
MY GOD, IT'S A LITTLE GIRL.

726
00:51:18.229 --> 00:51:19.530
- THIS LITTLE, POOR THING.

727
00:51:19.564 --> 00:51:21.332
SHE'S SCARED.

728
00:51:21.365 --> 00:51:24.469
HEY. HEY, IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

729
00:51:24.502 --> 00:51:26.237
HEY, DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU.


730
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:29.273
LOOK, EVEN MY DOG, SASQUATCH,
LIKES YOU, SEE?


731
00:51:31.242 --> 00:51:33.277
LOOKS LIKE YOU
MAKE FRIENDS FAST.


732
00:51:35.313 --> 00:51:36.414
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

733
00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:37.482
- SAS, GO.

734
00:51:37.515 --> 00:51:39.617
- DON'T YOU HAVE A NAME?

735
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.353
- MAYBE SHE CAN'T SPEAK.

736
00:51:42.386 --> 00:51:43.621
CAN WE SPEED UP
WITH YOUR TOUCHY-FEELY STUFF.


737
00:51:43.654 --> 00:51:45.556
TAKING THE INSTITUTE'S
OUR PRIORITY,


738
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.291
AND, IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,


739
00:51:47.325 --> 00:51:48.593
WE JUST LOST OUR RIDE HOME.

740
00:51:48.626 --> 00:51:50.428
- LET'S NOT RUSH INTO THINGS.

741
00:51:50.461 --> 00:51:52.530
ANYBODY WHO SURVIVED HERE
FOR THREE YEARS


742
00:51:52.563 --> 00:51:54.599
KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THE CITY THAN WE DO


743
00:51:54.632 --> 00:51:56.367
AND PROBABLY
ABOUT OUR ATTACKERS.


744
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.436
AND WHAT IF THEY ARE
THE ATTACKERS?


745
00:51:58.469 --> 00:52:00.571
SIR, I THINK OUR PRIORITY'S A...

746
00:52:00.605 --> 00:52:03.441
I'M PERFECTLY WELL AWARE
OF OUR PRIORITIES, HENLEY...


747
00:52:03.474 --> 00:52:05.443
AND ALSO OF
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.


748
00:52:05.476 --> 00:52:08.379
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE?


749
00:52:09.981 --> 00:52:12.383
HEY, DON'T WORRY.

750
00:52:12.416 --> 00:52:14.685
WE WON'T HURT YOU,
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP.


751
00:52:14.719 --> 00:52:17.588
HENLEY, GIVE ME ONE
OF YOUR ENERGY BARS.


752
00:52:17.622 --> 00:52:19.423
WHAT AM I?
THE SALVATION ARMY?


753
00:52:19.457 --> 00:52:21.526
- JUST DO IT.

754
00:52:30.568 --> 00:52:32.503
- YOU HUNGRY?

755
00:52:32.537 --> 00:52:34.572
HERE.

756
00:52:36.641 --> 00:52:38.276
YEAH.

757
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:41.512
LISTEN, WE REALLY NEED
TO SPEAK TO THE OTHER PEOPLE.


758
00:52:41.546 --> 00:52:43.514
CAN YOU TAKE US TO THEM?

759
00:52:46.484 --> 00:52:47.618
OKAY, GREAT.

760
00:53:15.546 --> 00:53:20.051
ALL THIS TIME,
WE THOUGHT NOBODY SURVIVED.


761
00:53:20.084 --> 00:53:21.586
- IT'S AMAZING.

762
00:53:34.565 --> 00:53:36.601
- WHERE DO YOU FIGURE WE ARE?

763
00:53:36.634 --> 00:53:41.472
UNLESS I'M COMPLETELY OFF, THIS
IS THE U2-LINE SERVICE STATION.


764
00:54:17.041 --> 00:54:18.542
- EXCUSE US.

765
00:54:18.576 --> 00:54:20.611
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
STRANGERS HERE SINCE...


766
00:54:20.645 --> 00:54:24.081
WELL, IT'S BEEN YEARS.

767
00:54:25.016 --> 00:54:26.684
WE WERE SENT HERE
BY THE GOVERNMENT


768
00:54:26.717 --> 00:54:28.419
OF THE PROVISIONAL
NORTHERN STATES.


769
00:54:28.452 --> 00:54:29.987
- FOR US?
- NO.


770
00:54:30.021 --> 00:54:31.355
- EXCUSE ME.

771
00:54:31.389 --> 00:54:33.891
HAVE YOU...

772
00:54:33.924 --> 00:54:38.496
SEEN...THESE...PEOPLE?

773
00:54:38.529 --> 00:54:40.431
NO?

774
00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:44.602
- NO, WE'RE HERE ON A MISSION.

775
00:54:44.635 --> 00:54:48.506
WE HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE ARE
STILL PEOPLE HERE.


776
00:54:48.539 --> 00:54:49.974
DID YOU TRY TO LEAVE?

777
00:54:50.007 --> 00:54:52.109
- THINGS GOT VERY BAD VERY FAST.

778
00:54:52.143 --> 00:54:54.879
NO PLACES WERE LEFT...
THE STREETS WERE BLOCKED.


779
00:54:54.912 --> 00:54:59.116
THE GROUND FROZE, SO WE COULDN'T
EVEN BURY THE DEAD.


780
00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:02.019
EVENTUALLY, A LOT OF US
WENT UNDERGROUND.


781
00:55:02.053 --> 00:55:03.154
- WHO'S YOUR LEADER?

782
00:55:03.187 --> 00:55:04.722
- LEADER?

783
00:55:04.755 --> 00:55:08.025
WELL, SOMEONE MUST BE
ORGANIZING ALL THIS.


784
00:55:08.059 --> 00:55:10.127
WELL, HE'S NOT
SO MUCH OF A LEADER,


785
00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:13.097
BUT THE DOCTOR HAS HELPED US
TO GET THINGS ORGANIZED.


786
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:14.432
- CAN WE TALK TO HIM?

787
00:55:14.465 --> 00:55:16.067
- HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

788
00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.635
HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF.

789
00:55:17.668 --> 00:55:20.638
HE'S NOT VERY WELL
ON HIS FEET THESE DAYS.


790
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:22.807
HE USUALLY IS IN THE REICHTAG.

791
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.742
- AND HOW DO WE GET THERE?

792
00:55:24.775 --> 00:55:29.046
OH, GO DOWN THE OTHER TUNNEL
ABOUT 500 METERS.


793
00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.916
YOU'LL SEE A BREAK...
YOU SEE, WE BROKE THROUGH A WALL


794
00:55:31.949 --> 00:55:33.484
TO GET A DIRECT ACCESS TO IT.

795
00:55:33.517 --> 00:55:34.852
- THANK YOU.

796
00:55:42.026 --> 00:55:43.561
- TOM?

797
00:55:43.594 --> 00:55:45.930
TOM, ARE YOU COMING?

798
00:55:51.669 --> 00:55:54.205
IS THIS LITTLE GIRL
PART OF YOUR GROUP?


799
00:55:54.238 --> 00:55:58.008
HER PARENTS WERE KILLED
IN AN ACCIDENT A FEW YEARS BACK.


800
00:55:58.042 --> 00:56:02.012
WE OFFERED HER A PLACE TO LIVE,
BUT SHE LIKES TO COME AND GO.


801
00:56:27.638 --> 00:56:29.874
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- SOMETHING DOESN'T ADD UP.


802
00:56:29.907 --> 00:56:31.842
I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN THINGS DON'T ADD UP.


803
00:56:31.876 --> 00:56:33.711
HEY, LOOK, I THINK
WE CAN SAFELY SAY


804
00:56:33.744 --> 00:56:36.647
THAT THESE PEOPLE
DIDN'T ATTACK US.


805
00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.150
HAD ANYONE SEEN YOUR FAMILY?
- NO.


806
00:56:50.094 --> 00:56:52.196
- TOBIN, SECURE THE POSITION.

807
00:57:34.205 --> 00:57:36.707
SOMEBODY'S GOT
A REAL GREEN THUMB.


808
00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.709
- YEAH, I GUESS I DID SEE LIGHTS.

809
00:57:38.742 --> 00:57:41.212
LET'S SPREAD OUT
AND FIND THIS DOCTOR.


810
00:57:41.245 --> 00:57:43.180
ELLISON, SECURE THIS POSITION.

811
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:48.118
- SAS, WAIT.

812
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:36.700
FINSCHEN, WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO, MY LITTLE GIRL?


813
00:58:37.868 --> 00:58:40.037
- DADDY?

814
00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:42.039
- ANNA.

815
00:58:42.072 --> 00:58:44.208
- DADDY.

816
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:47.878
- DADDY.
- ANNA.


817
00:58:54.084 --> 00:58:56.153
- DADDY?

818
00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:04.094
DADDY, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU?

819
00:59:04.128 --> 00:59:07.264
WHEN I DECIDED TO STAY, I KNEW
THERE'D BE A PRICE TO PAY.


820
00:59:07.298 --> 00:59:10.868
I COULDN'T LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME.


821
00:59:10.901 --> 00:59:13.203
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?

822
00:59:13.237 --> 00:59:18.142
OH, DADDY, I FORGAVE YOU
A LONG TIME AGO.


823
00:59:18.175 --> 00:59:21.145
YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT
WAS RIGHT.


824
00:59:21.178 --> 00:59:25.282
- SO, I GUESS YOU'
RE THE DOCTOR.

825
00:59:25.316 --> 00:59:27.084
- OH, REALLY?

826
00:59:27.117 --> 00:59:31.255
THAT'S...WHAT PEOPLE CALL ME
BECAUSE I HELP THEM TO GET BY.


827
00:59:31.288 --> 00:59:33.257
- DAD, THIS IS TOM PARKER.

828
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.391
REMEMBER HIM?

829
00:59:34.425 --> 00:59:37.027
HE WAS THE HEAD OF SECURITY

830
00:59:37.061 --> 00:59:39.663
AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSY
IN BERLIN...


831
00:59:39.697 --> 00:59:41.065
THE NIGHT WE DISCOVERED

832
00:59:41.098 --> 00:59:42.733
BAY-LEDER 7 HAD
CHANGED COURSE...


833
00:59:42.766 --> 00:59:46.036
- I'VE FORGOTTEN SO MANY THINGS.

834
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:51.175
WELL, MR. PARKER, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU COULDN'T STAY AWAY, EITHER.


835
00:59:51.208 --> 00:59:52.276
- YES, SIR.

836
00:59:55.079 --> 00:59:56.380
- CUCURBITA LAGENARIA.

837
00:59:56.413 --> 00:59:59.249
THE ORDINARY CUCUMBER.

838
00:59:59.283 --> 01:00:01.919
- DAD, WHO BUILT THIS?

839
01:00:01.952 --> 01:00:03.754
- WE ALL PULLED TOGETHER...

840
01:00:03.787 --> 01:00:06.190
PLENTY OF TIME,
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.


841
01:00:06.223 --> 01:00:09.126
- SO, YOU GROW ALL THE FOOD HERE?

842
01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:10.928
- ONLY A LITTLE.

843
01:00:10.961 --> 01:00:15.232
THREE YEARS AGO, STARVATION WAS
AS MUCH AS A KILLER AS THE COLD.


844
01:00:15.265 --> 01:00:17.001
THE COLD FINALLY WON.

845
01:00:17.034 --> 01:00:19.069
SO MANY DIED
THAT THOSE WHO SURVIVED


846
01:00:19.103 --> 01:00:21.338
COULD EASILY LIVE
FROM THE FOOD THEY FOUND


847
01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:23.741
FROZEN IN THE STORE
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.


848
01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:26.477
- SO, THEN WHY BUILD ALL THIS?

849
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:30.080
PEOPLE SHOULD
ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE


850
01:00:30.114 --> 01:00:34.184
WHERE THEY CAN FEEL
THE LIGHT, MR. PARKER.


851
01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:38.188
HE WILL BE TRYING TO SELL US
A TIMESHARE NEXT.


852
01:00:38.222 --> 01:00:40.124
- WHO IS THIS?

853
01:00:40.157 --> 01:00:42.026
WE CAME HERE WITH COLONEL
WATERS AND A FEW SOLDIERS.


854
01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:44.061
WHY HAVE YOU
BROUGHT IN SOLDIERS?


855
01:00:44.094 --> 01:00:47.031
- IT'S SECURITY MEASURE, MR. STARNDORF.
- SECURITY MEASURE?


856
01:00:47.064 --> 01:00:49.733
THE ONLY PEOPLE STILL CARRYING
GUNS ARE THE DISTRIBUTORS...


857
01:00:49.767 --> 01:00:51.101
MY SECURITY FORCE.

858
01:00:51.135 --> 01:00:53.137
AND WHY EXACTLY DO YOU NEED
A SECURITY FORCE?


859
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.305
AFTER THE STORMS,
PEOPLE CAME IN FROM THE NORTH.


860
01:00:55.339 --> 01:00:57.374
WHEN THEY THREATENED
OUR EXISTENCE, WE...


861
01:00:57.408 --> 01:01:02.046
SO DISTRIBUTORS WERE FORMED
TO PROTECT YOU FROM LOOTERS.


862
01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:04.048
- WE HELPED AS MANY AS WE COULD.

863
01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:06.016
AND WHAT EXACTLY
ARE THEY DOING NOW?


864
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.385
AS THE WORD IMPLIES,
THEY ARE DISTRIBUTING


865
01:01:08.419 --> 01:01:11.422
FOOD AND MATERIALS IN THE REGION
AND SETTLE CONFLICTS.


866
01:01:18.062 --> 01:01:19.430
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE STILL ALIVE IN BERLIN?


867
01:01:19.463 --> 01:01:23.400
- LET ME GUESS... 603?

868
01:01:23.434 --> 01:01:25.102
WE HAVE 11 BABIES.

869
01:01:25.135 --> 01:01:28.105
WHO EXACTLY IS IN CONTROL OF
N.L.O.S.I. AT THIS TIME?


870
01:01:28.138 --> 01:01:30.174
- OH, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

871
01:01:30.207 --> 01:01:31.809
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DAD?

872
01:01:31.842 --> 01:01:33.310
- THE REACTIVATION OF SolStar-2.

873
01:01:33.343 --> 01:01:35.179
THE USE OF SolStar-2 AS
A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION.


874
01:01:35.212 --> 01:01:37.114
IT HAS BEEN DEEMED
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.


875
01:01:37.147 --> 01:01:38.248
- THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
- CONSIDER YOURSELF UNDER ARREST


876
01:01:38.282 --> 01:01:41.185
AND SURRENDER CONTROL OF
THE SATELLITE TO US IMMEDIATELY.


877
01:01:41.218 --> 01:01:44.154
WHO EXACTLY IS IN CONTROL
OF SolStar-2 RIGHT NOW?


878
01:01:44.188 --> 01:01:45.789
- AFTER I DESIGNED THE PLAN,

879
01:01:45.823 --> 01:01:48.192
WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BEST
THAT HINTZE SHOULD RUN IT.


880
01:01:48.225 --> 01:01:50.094
- KLAUS HINTZE?

881
01:01:50.127 --> 01:01:52.129
OF COURSE. CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?


882
01:01:52.162 --> 01:01:54.064
- WHAT EXACTLY WAS YOUR PLAN?

883
01:01:54.098 --> 01:01:59.069
MY PLAN WAS... MY PLAN IS
TO WIDEN THE FOCUS OF THE BEAM


884
01:01:59.103 --> 01:02:01.538
TO TARGET AN AREA
NEARLY 1,000 KILOMETERS WIDE.


885
01:02:01.572 --> 01:02:03.440
THE BEAM WOULD HAVE
HARDLY ANY EFFECT.


886
01:02:03.474 --> 01:02:05.175
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT HINTZE THOUGHT,


887
01:02:05.209 --> 01:02:07.144
BUT I COULD PROVE TO HIM,

888
01:02:07.177 --> 01:02:08.545
SINCE THE WEATHER HAD
VIRTUALLY COME TO A STANDSTILL,


889
01:02:08.579 --> 01:02:10.080
IT WOULD ACCUMULATE THE EFFECTS.

890
01:02:10.114 --> 01:02:11.582
YEAH, BY BOMBARDING
THE COLD LAYER


891
01:02:11.615 --> 01:02:13.317
WITH A LOW-INTENSITY
MICROWAVE BEAM,


892
01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:15.018
YOU COULD CREATE
AN ARTIFICIAL WARM FRONT.


893
01:02:15.052 --> 01:02:16.220
- RESULTING IN WHAT?

894
01:02:16.253 --> 01:02:19.256
- CLIMATE KICK START.

895
01:02:24.595 --> 01:02:27.097
AT THIS MOMENT,
SolStar-2 IS POWERED UP


896
01:02:27.131 --> 01:02:29.399
AND AIMED AT CITIES
IN NORTHERN AFRICA.


897
01:02:29.433 --> 01:02:31.502
TAKE ME TO
THE INSTITUTE RIGHT NOW.


898
01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:40.110
- DOCTOR, NOT IN YOUR CONDITION.

899
01:02:40.144 --> 01:02:43.213
ANY HAND TOUCHES METAL,
YOU'RE DEAD.


900
01:02:43.247 --> 01:02:44.515
DOWN.

901
01:02:51.255 --> 01:02:53.290
- SO, YOU HAVE BETRAYED ME.

902
01:02:53.323 --> 01:02:55.225
- DOCTOR, BE FAIR.

903
01:02:55.259 --> 01:02:58.428
HAVEN'T WE BEEN HELPING
ALL THE TIME?


904
01:02:58.462 --> 01:03:03.066
TAKING MY TECHNOLOGY AND USING
IT FOR... COMMIT A MASS MURDER.


905
01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.169
- IT'S A WAR ABOUT SURVIVAL,

906
01:03:05.202 --> 01:03:08.438
AND WE JUST GOT OURSELVES
A WEAPON THAT CAN WIN IT.


907
01:03:08.472 --> 01:03:10.340
- SO, WHAT?

908
01:03:10.374 --> 01:03:12.509
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?

909
01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:15.212
- THE QUESTION IS, DOCTOR,

910
01:03:15.245 --> 01:03:19.116
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO?


911
01:03:23.086 --> 01:03:25.122
- NO, I DO NOT.

912
01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:21.044
- IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

913
01:04:21.078 --> 01:04:22.279
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.
- I'M GOOD.


914
01:04:26.483 --> 01:04:29.019
- ANNA?

915
01:04:29.052 --> 01:04:32.189
ANNA.

916
01:04:32.222 --> 01:04:35.592
PLEASE,
DADDY, DON'T...


917
01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:38.262
- DON'T CRY, MY LOVE.

918
01:04:40.197 --> 01:04:43.367
I'VE GOT MORE
THAN I EVER HOPED FOR.


919
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.335
I GOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

920
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:48.205
YES, I'M... I'M HERE.

921
01:04:48.238 --> 01:04:52.109
MR. STARNDORF, WE NEED THE
MASTER CODES AT THE INSTITUTE...


922
01:04:52.142 --> 01:04:54.211
- LEAVE US ALONE!

923
01:04:57.447 --> 01:05:03.053
REMEMBER...
IT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAID.


924
01:05:03.086 --> 01:05:05.222
- REMEMBER WHAT?

925
01:05:05.255 --> 01:05:09.259
- YOU ALWAYS TOLD ME TO REMEMBER.

926
01:05:09.293 --> 01:05:12.229
- REMEMBER WHAT, DADDY?

927
01:05:12.262 --> 01:05:16.433
NO.

928
01:05:19.202 --> 01:05:21.271
SIR, CAN I SUGGEST
THAT WE PUSH ON TO THE INSTITUTE


929
01:05:21.305 --> 01:05:24.141
AND TAKE CONTROL BEFORE HINTZE
FINDS OUT HIS TEAM FAILED?


930
01:05:24.174 --> 01:05:26.376
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.


931
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.345
MS. STARNDORF,
PLEASE COME WITH US.


932
01:05:28.378 --> 01:05:31.114
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS THE FACILITY.


933
01:05:34.351 --> 01:05:36.253
BUT I CAN'T
LEAVE HIM LIKE THIS.


934
01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:41.625
ANNA, HE WOULD HAVE
WANTED YOU TO STOP HINTZE.


935
01:06:14.524 --> 01:06:17.527
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

936
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:21.198
HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN.

937
01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:23.300
I KNOW, BUT FATHER
CARED TOO MUCH FOR OTHER PEOPLE


938
01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:25.469
AND TOO LITTLE FOR HIMSELF.

939
01:06:25.502 --> 01:06:28.372
THAT'S WHY MY MOTHER LEFT HIM.

940
01:06:28.405 --> 01:06:30.374
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE HE DID
A LOT OF GOOD


941
01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:32.275
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE.

942
01:06:34.578 --> 01:06:37.080
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

943
01:06:37.114 --> 01:06:39.182
WHAT MADE YOU GO LOOKING
FOR YOUR FAMILY AGAIN?


944
01:06:39.216 --> 01:06:42.452
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
ALL YOU WANTED.


945
01:06:42.486 --> 01:06:45.455
WE HAVE TO FINISH WHAT WE'RE
DOING HERE FIRST...


946
01:06:45.489 --> 01:06:48.592
THEN I'LL FIND MY FAMILY.

947
01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:50.494
IT LOOKS WE'RE BOTH
MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE


948
01:06:50.527 --> 01:06:52.863
THAN WE CARE TO ADMIT.

949
01:06:52.896 --> 01:06:54.598
- YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

950
01:06:57.501 --> 01:06:59.569
- YEP, I'M GONNA PUKE.

951
01:07:06.443 --> 01:07:08.178
- DON'T MOVE!

952
01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:13.350
- WHERE'S THE DOCTOR?

953
01:07:13.383 --> 01:07:16.219
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HIM?

954
01:07:20.857 --> 01:07:22.392
- HE'S DEAD.

955
01:07:22.426 --> 01:07:23.827
- SEE, HERR HINTZE WAS RIGHT.

956
01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.496
OKAY, H-HOLD ON,
WE DIDN'T KILL HIM.


957
01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:28.632
- WAIT. THE GIRL WAS WITH THEM.

958
01:07:28.665 --> 01:07:30.367
SHE MUST HAVE SEEN
WHAT HAPPENED.


959
01:07:31.601 --> 01:07:34.304
DID THEY KILL THE DOCTOR?

960
01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:39.876
- THEN WHO DID?

961
01:07:41.545 --> 01:07:43.380
- NOW, JUST A SECOND!

962
01:07:49.453 --> 01:07:51.588
THE REAR ENTRANCE TUNNEL LEADS
RIGHT TO THE MAIN LINE.


963
01:07:51.621 --> 01:07:52.923
- GUARDED?
- ONE GUARD.


964
01:07:52.956 --> 01:07:54.224
- HOW MANY PEOPLE INSIDE?

965
01:07:54.257 --> 01:07:55.559
FIVE, MAYBE SIX
IN THE INSTITUTE,


966
01:07:55.592 --> 01:07:57.461
AND TWO MORE
PATROLLING THE MAIN TUNNEL.


967
01:07:57.494 --> 01:08:00.163
OKAY, SO, WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO CREATE A DIVERSION


968
01:08:00.197 --> 01:08:02.199
IN THE MAIN TUNNEL
TO DRAW THE GUARDS AWAY.


969
01:08:02.232 --> 01:08:03.333
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

970
01:08:03.366 --> 01:08:04.534
- YES.
- OKAY! LET'S GO!


971
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:08.371
- WAIT, HOLD ON.

972
01:08:08.405 --> 01:08:09.606
- WE STAY.

973
01:08:09.639 --> 01:08:11.441
I NEED YOU TO STAY HERE, OKAY?

974
01:08:11.475 --> 01:08:14.311
MY DOG, SAS... HE HATES
TO BE ALONE, OKAY?


975
01:08:14.344 --> 01:08:15.445
SO, SAS.

976
01:08:15.479 --> 01:08:17.948
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAY
WITH HIM UNTIL I COME BACK?


977
01:08:17.981 --> 01:08:21.551
YES? OKAY? SAS, STAY.
STAY, SAS.


978
01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:54.818
ARE YOU SURE
THIS WILL WORK, HENLEY?


979
01:08:54.851 --> 01:08:56.586
- NEVER FAILS.

980
01:09:15.272 --> 01:09:16.506
- HOW DID IT GO?

981
01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.908
- PERFECTLY.

982
01:09:17.941 --> 01:09:21.511
OH, YEAH, AND I DO
HAVE A NICE ASS.


983
01:09:26.583 --> 01:09:28.251
- OKAY, WE SPLIT UP.

984
01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:29.352
YOU'RE WITH ME.

985
01:09:29.386 --> 01:09:30.620
COME ON, LET'S GO.

986
01:11:25.101 --> 01:11:26.836
GOOD WORK. NO ALARMS.

987
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:29.472
TILL WE'RE THROUGH THAT DOOR,
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE IN TANGIERS.


988
01:11:29.506 --> 01:11:32.108
YEAH, WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.


989
01:11:35.512 --> 01:11:37.614
- HE DOESN'T LOOK WELL.

990
01:11:44.754 --> 01:11:46.523
HE'S LOOKING AT A MONITOR.

991
01:11:46.556 --> 01:11:48.458
CHECKING THE FLIGHT PATH
OF SolStar-2.


992
01:11:48.491 --> 01:11:49.893
- NO, NO, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S...

993
01:11:51.027 --> 01:11:52.595
- A SECURITY
-CAMERA MONITOR?

994
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:55.131
HEY, GUYS, HOW YOU DOING?
WELCOME TO BERLIN!


995
01:11:55.165 --> 01:11:57.133
BEEN A FEW CHANGES
SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST,


996
01:11:57.167 --> 01:11:58.635
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU NOTICED THAT.

997
01:11:58.668 --> 01:11:59.903
HI, ANNA.

998
01:12:01.104 --> 01:12:03.673
DID YOU MISS ME?
I MISSED YOU.


999
01:12:03.707 --> 01:12:05.608
"WHY, SURE, KLAUS. HOW YOU BEEN?
WHAT'S GOING ON?"


1000
01:12:05.642 --> 01:12:07.877
OH, YOU KNOW, NOT A LOT... JUST
CHILLING OUT.


1001
01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:10.480
DO YOU GUYS LIKE MY NEW
SECURITY MODIFICATIONS?


1002
01:12:12.849 --> 01:12:15.618
MNH! NICE SHOT, SOLDIER.

1003
01:12:15.652 --> 01:12:20.890
WELL, WELL, WELL, COLONEL,
UH...WALKER, ISN'T IT?


1004
01:12:20.924 --> 01:12:22.859
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, HINTZE?

1005
01:12:22.892 --> 01:12:25.061
- NOTHING YOU CAN GIVE ME...SIR.

1006
01:12:25.095 --> 01:12:26.930
SIR, YES, SIR!

1007
01:12:26.963 --> 01:12:29.833
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?


1008
01:12:29.866 --> 01:12:32.836
HM, OKAY, UM,
I'D LIKE TO TRAVEL THE WORLD,


1009
01:12:32.869 --> 01:12:35.038
HELP CHILDREN,
AND OPEN A BOUTIQUE.


1010
01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.975
NO, I'D
ACTUALLY LIKE MY LIFE BACK.


1011
01:12:39.008 --> 01:12:40.643
YOU KNOW, THE FUTURE
I WAS GONNA HAVE...


1012
01:12:40.677 --> 01:12:42.445
THE WIFE, THE KIDS,
THE HOUSE, THE BARBECUE,


1013
01:12:42.479 --> 01:12:43.913
THE DISTINGUISHED
ACADEMIC CAREER.


1014
01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:45.815
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
THAT ON YOU, COLONEL, DO YA?


1015
01:12:45.849 --> 01:12:47.617
I DIDN'T THINK YOU DID.
TRAVELING LIGHT?


1016
01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:49.152
AND WHAT'S THAT?
A PLACE IN THE SUN?


1017
01:12:49.185 --> 01:12:51.020
LIFETIME SUPPLY OF PLAYMATES?

1018
01:12:51.054 --> 01:12:53.156
24/7 HAPPY HOUR
AT THE LOCAL BAR?


1019
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:56.059
WELL, THAT'S VERY TEMPTING...
SUN, WOMEN, AND LIQUOR.


1020
01:12:56.092 --> 01:12:57.927
MNAH!

1021
01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:00.697
GODDAMN IT, COLONEL, THROW IN
A BACK RUB AND YOU GOT A DEAL!


1022
01:13:02.232 --> 01:13:03.833
DO YOU THINK THAT ANYTHING
THAT YOU COULD OFFER ME


1023
01:13:03.867 --> 01:13:06.603
COULD COMPENSATE
FOR THESE THREE YEARS IN HELL?


1024
01:13:06.636 --> 01:13:08.138
- HE'S CRAZY.

1025
01:13:08.171 --> 01:13:11.207
NOW, THAT'S A CHEAP SHOT,
COLONEL, AND I RESENT IT.


1026
01:13:11.241 --> 01:13:12.475
I REALLY DO.

1027
01:13:12.509 --> 01:13:14.144
"CRAZY"!

1028
01:13:14.177 --> 01:13:16.946
WELL, EVEN IF I WAS, IT DOESN'T
AUTOMATICALLY MAKE ME DEAF,


1029
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.014
SO BE POLITE.

1030
01:13:18.047 --> 01:13:20.150
SHOW SOME RESPECT, YOU BASTARD!

1031
01:13:20.183 --> 01:13:22.085
- KLAUS, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

1032
01:13:22.118 --> 01:13:24.621
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
TO MY FATHER?


1033
01:13:24.654 --> 01:13:27.857
- ANNA, I LOVE YOUR FATHER.

1034
01:13:27.891 --> 01:13:29.592
WELL, I LOVED HIM
UNTIL I FIND OUT


1035
01:13:29.626 --> 01:13:31.127
THAT THE HYPOCRITICAL BASTARD
HAD GONE AND BETRAYED ME.


1036
01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:33.963
HE STABBED ME IN THE HEART,
AND THAT REALLY HURT.


1037
01:13:33.997 --> 01:13:37.567
HE TOLD ME SolStar-2
WAS ALL ABOUT PEACE...


1038
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.236
"BRINGING PEACE
TO AN ENERGY-STARVED WORLD"...


1039
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:42.672
AND THEN NEGOTIATED
WITH THE MILITARY


1040
01:13:42.705 --> 01:13:46.976
TO FUND IT BEHIND MY BACK...
HIS CHIEF ENGINEER, SEVEN YEARS!


1041
01:13:49.312 --> 01:13:52.182
BET YOU ALL KNOW
ALL ABOUT THAT, COLONEL.


1042
01:13:52.215 --> 01:13:53.950
- KLAUS, IT WAS ABOUT FUNDING.

1043
01:13:53.983 --> 01:13:55.819
THE WORLD ISN'T BLACK AND WHITE.

1044
01:13:55.852 --> 01:13:58.054
OH, IT IS. WELL,
IT'S WHITE, ANYWAY. IT'S WHITE.


1045
01:13:58.087 --> 01:13:59.823
IT'S WHITE, WHITE, WHITE, WHITE!

1046
01:13:59.856 --> 01:14:02.225
BUT YOUR BASTARD FATHER...
HE SAID TO ME,


1047
01:14:02.258 --> 01:14:04.027
"KLAUS, WE MUST STAY HERE

1048
01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.862
AND HELP THE OTHERS
UNTIL THE RESCUERS COME."


1049
01:14:05.895 --> 01:14:08.798
ARE YOU THE RESCUERS? YOU DON'T
LOOK LIKE THE RESCUERS.


1050
01:14:08.832 --> 01:14:10.967
THEY DIDN'T COME! BUT ME
AND MY BOYS... WE GOT ORGANIZED.


1051
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.101
WE KNOW THE DEAL.

1052
01:14:12.135 --> 01:14:14.003
BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

1053
01:14:14.037 --> 01:14:17.540
WE'RE PRETTY PISSED OFF
ABOUT BEING LEFT BEHIND,


1054
01:14:17.574 --> 01:14:20.710
SO WE DECIDED
TO GIVE YOU GUYS A WAKE-UP CALL


1055
01:14:20.743 --> 01:14:22.846
AND, UH, WRITE SOME HISTORY
AT THE SAME TIME.


1056
01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:24.047
YES, SIR.

1057
01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.849
- IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

1058
01:14:25.882 --> 01:14:27.817
I HATE TO
CONTRADICT YOU, DARLING,


1059
01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:29.152
BUT I HAVE THE BIGGEST GUN,

1060
01:14:29.185 --> 01:14:31.654
WHICH MEANS IT'S
WHOSEVER FAULT I SAY IT IS.


1061
01:14:31.688 --> 01:14:33.189
YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF READING


1062
01:14:33.223 --> 01:14:34.591
WHILE I'VE BEEN HERE...
DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ELSE TO DO.


1063
01:14:34.624 --> 01:14:35.992
SHAKESPEARE...
YOU KNOW THAT GUY?


1064
01:14:36.025 --> 01:14:37.861
HE'S REALLY GOOD,
GOT A LOT OF GOOD SOUND BITES.


1065
01:14:37.894 --> 01:14:39.696
YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING?
HOW ABOUT THIS...


1066
01:14:39.729 --> 01:14:42.232
"AS FLIES,
ARE WE, TO THE WANTON GODS.


1067
01:14:42.265 --> 01:14:44.767
THEY KILL US FOR THEIR SPORT."

1068
01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:47.103
WHICH MAKES YOU
AND EVERYBODY ELSE THE FLIES.


1069
01:14:47.136 --> 01:14:49.339
AND ME... BAH, WELL,
YOU GET THE PICTURE.


1070
01:14:49.372 --> 01:14:52.175
IF I TRY AND BREAK THIS LOCK,
IT WILL SELF-DESTRUCT


1071
01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:54.244
AND THE PASSWORD
IS 512-BIT ENCODED.


1072
01:14:54.277 --> 01:14:57.580
WELL, WE'VE GOT LESS THAN
TWO HOURS BEFORE THAT NUTBAR


1073
01:14:57.614 --> 01:14:59.148
HAS ENOUGH POWER
TO BLOW UP TANGIERS, HERE.


1074
01:14:59.182 --> 01:15:01.084
- ANNA. ANNA.

1075
01:15:01.117 --> 01:15:02.719
WE NEED YOUR FATHER'S PASSWORD.

1076
01:15:02.752 --> 01:15:04.120
- I DON'T KNOW IT.

1077
01:15:04.153 --> 01:15:07.590
HE TOLD YOU THAT...
TO REMEMBER, OKAY?


1078
01:15:07.624 --> 01:15:08.958
SO IT JUST MEANS YOU KNEW IT
AT ONE POINT IN TIME, RIGHT?


1079
01:15:08.992 --> 01:15:10.193
SO, JUST THINK.

1080
01:15:15.732 --> 01:15:18.234
WELL, THAT'S
SEVEN POINTS FOR TRYING.


1081
01:15:18.268 --> 01:15:20.169
COME ON, GUYS! 
YOU CAN GET IT.

1082
01:15:20.203 --> 01:15:23.006
ONLY 7 TRILLION
POSSIBILITIES TO GO.


1083
01:15:23.039 --> 01:15:25.642
I KIND OF HOPE YOU GET IT.

1084
01:15:28.044 --> 01:15:30.747
I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU GUYS
SINCE WE'RE GETTING ON SO WELL,


1085
01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.649
BUT I GOT MY DUTY.
I GOT A JOB TO DO.


1086
01:15:32.682 --> 01:15:34.217
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
COLONEL.


1087
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:36.953
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
I GOT A CITY TO DESTROY.


1088
01:15:36.986 --> 01:15:39.188
YOU CAN STAY AND WATCH
IF YOU WANT.


1089
01:15:39.222 --> 01:15:40.757
- WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU, HINTZE?

1090
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:42.892
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A VERY
INTERESTING QUESTION.


1091
01:15:42.926 --> 01:15:45.028
AS A DELAY TACTIC,
IT'S ALSO NOT SO BAD.


1092
01:15:45.061 --> 01:15:46.062
IT'S... IT'S HARD TO ANSWER.

1093
01:15:46.095 --> 01:15:47.730
IT'S A LOT OF THINGS, YOU KNOW.

1094
01:15:47.764 --> 01:15:49.966
IT'S BETRAYAL, JUSTICE, REVENGE,
WHICH IS VERY SWEET.


1095
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.368
I'M REALLY BEYOND ALL THAT.

1096
01:15:52.402 --> 01:15:53.970
LET'S JUST STAY
WITH THE INSANE THEORY, HUH?


1097
01:15:54.003 --> 01:15:55.605
KEEP IT SIMPLE. THAT'S MY MOTTO.

1098
01:15:56.372 --> 01:15:58.341
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING
VERY CLOSE,


1099
01:15:58.374 --> 01:16:01.311
AND, UH, YOU CAN STAY AND WATCH,
BUT YOU GOT TO BE QUIET, OKAY?


1100
01:16:01.344 --> 01:16:03.980
I LIKE TO WORK TO MUSIC,
SO EXCUSE ME.


1101
01:16:12.288 --> 01:16:13.990
- I DON'T KNOW HIS PASSWORD.

1102
01:16:14.023 --> 01:16:15.959
COME ON, ANNA.
HE TOLD YOU TO REMEMBER.


1103
01:16:15.992 --> 01:16:17.026
REMEMBER WHAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?


1104
01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.227
REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT?

1105
01:16:18.261 --> 01:16:20.763
- WHAT ABOUT HIS FAVORITE COLOR?

1106
01:16:20.797 --> 01:16:22.699
HE'D COME UP WITH THESE
COMPLICATED PASSWORDS


1107
01:16:22.732 --> 01:16:24.067
THAT HE'D ALWAYS FORGET.

1108
01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.902
WE HAD TO ANALOG HIS NOTEBOOK
EVERY WEEK.


1109
01:16:25.935 --> 01:16:28.171
I ALWAYS TOLD HIM
THAT THE ONLY GOOD PASSWORD


1110
01:16:28.204 --> 01:16:30.340
IS ONE YOU CAN REMEMBER.

1111
01:16:30.373 --> 01:16:31.407
- THE NAME OF HIS MISTRESS?

1112
01:16:38.114 --> 01:16:40.350
- WHAT A SECOND. I'VE GOT IT.

1113
01:16:40.383 --> 01:16:42.085
IT'S "REMEMBER."

1114
01:16:42.118 --> 01:16:44.420
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WAIT. WAIT.


1115
01:16:44.454 --> 01:16:46.990
HE'LL HEAR THE SYSTEM DISENGAGE.

1116
01:16:47.023 --> 01:16:49.158
LET'S GET READY.

1117
01:17:01.104 --> 01:17:03.473
OKAY.

1118
01:17:03.506 --> 01:17:05.274
AND...GO!

1119
01:17:10.179 --> 01:17:11.314
- YOU REMEMBERED.

1120
01:17:11.347 --> 01:17:13.416
BUT YOU'RE TOO LATE!

1121
01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:24.494
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!


1122
01:17:24.527 --> 01:17:26.095
HE WAS NO THREAT.

1123
01:17:26.129 --> 01:17:28.064
I DIDN'T SEE IT
LIKE THAT, COLONEL.


1124
01:17:28.097 --> 01:17:31.000
I HAVE TO TRY
TO OVERRIDE THE PROGRAM.


1125
01:17:31.034 --> 01:17:33.503
DO IT. WE'RE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.


1126
01:17:35.104 --> 01:17:35.972
OH, MY GOD.

1127
01:17:36.005 --> 01:17:38.107
THE BASTARD SAW US COMING
THE WHOLE WAY.


1128
01:17:38.141 --> 01:17:41.044
HE'S GOT SECURITY CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE.


1129
01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:50.053
- I USED TO LIVE RIGHT THERE.

1130
01:17:50.086 --> 01:17:55.024
MY DAUGHTER USED TO PLAY
IN THE PARK ACROSS THE STREET.


1131
01:17:56.392 --> 01:17:58.995
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

1132
01:17:59.028 --> 01:18:00.296
- FOR WHAT?

1133
01:18:00.329 --> 01:18:02.031
- BEFORE.

1134
01:18:02.065 --> 01:18:02.999
YOUR FAMILY.

1135
01:18:03.032 --> 01:18:05.168
ORDERING YOU TO LEAVE.

1136
01:18:05.201 --> 01:18:07.170
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO FORGIVE AND FORGET, COLONEL,


1137
01:18:07.203 --> 01:18:09.205
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

1138
01:18:09.238 --> 01:18:12.475
NOT A SINGLE DAY GOES BY WHERE
I DON'T REGRET THAT DECISION


1139
01:18:12.508 --> 01:18:15.078
TO FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS
AND GET ON THAT PLANE.


1140
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:18.347
SO, WHY DON'T YOU GO FIND OUT
WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO FIND OUT?


1141
01:18:18.381 --> 01:18:20.183
- SHIT.

1142
01:18:20.216 --> 01:18:21.451
- WHAT IS IT, HENLEY?

1143
01:18:21.484 --> 01:18:24.420
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
FOLLOWED US HERE.


1144
01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:27.523
- IT'S NOT SAFE HERE.

1145
01:18:27.557 --> 01:18:29.759
- I'LL GO GET HER.

1146
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.229
- GOOD IDEA, PARKER.

1147
01:18:42.038 --> 01:18:44.307
SO, HAVE YOU GOT CONTROL
OF THE SATELLITE YET?


1148
01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.476
- ALMOST, YEAH.
- JUST RELAX, HENLEY.


1149
01:18:46.509 --> 01:18:49.078
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN, COLONEL.


1150
01:18:49.112 --> 01:18:50.480
I'M VERY RELAXED.

1151
01:18:53.116 --> 01:18:55.384
SIT DOWN!

1152
01:18:55.418 --> 01:18:59.055
NOW, SHUT THE DOOR
AND CHANGE THE PASSWORD.


1153
01:18:59.088 --> 01:19:02.291
WE DON'T WANT TO LET PARKER
INTERRUPT US, NOW, DO WE?


1154
01:19:19.442 --> 01:19:23.513
I SUPPOSE YOU'VE
PROBABLY GOT SOME QUESTIONS.


1155
01:19:23.546 --> 01:19:25.081
- YES.

1156
01:19:25.114 --> 01:19:27.517
JUST AS WELL.
I'VE GOT THE ANSWERS, THEN.


1157
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:29.385
SEE, WHEN THE MILITARY FOUND OUT

1158
01:19:29.418 --> 01:19:30.987
THAT THE SATELLITE
WAS STILL FUNCTIONING,


1159
01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.355
SOME OF US WEREN'T TOO HAPPY

1160
01:19:32.388 --> 01:19:35.491
WITH THE IDEA OF DESTROYING
A PERFECTLY GOOD WEAPON.


1161
01:19:35.525 --> 01:19:39.028
UNFORTUNATELY, PRESIDENT
HARRISON DIDN'T QUITE AGREE.


1162
01:19:39.061 --> 01:19:41.364
SO, YOU SEE,
I WAS PLANTED ON THIS MISSION


1163
01:19:41.397 --> 01:19:44.267
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WEAPON
WASN'T DESTROYED.


1164
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.535
WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH IT?


1165
01:19:45.568 --> 01:19:47.270
- I WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

1166
01:19:47.303 --> 01:19:49.071
CHANGE THE WORLD.

1167
01:19:49.105 --> 01:19:51.474
ANNA, THE ARABS HAVE
RAISED THE PRICE OF GAS


1168
01:19:51.507 --> 01:19:53.276
TO NEARLY $100 A GALLON.

1169
01:19:53.309 --> 01:19:55.111
THEY'RE SQUEEZING US
BECAUSE THEY KNOW


1170
01:19:55.144 --> 01:19:58.214
2/3 OF THE WORLD IS HIDDEN
UNDER ICE AND NEEDS THE ENERGY.


1171
01:19:58.247 --> 01:20:01.017
NOW, IF, SAY,
SOME ROGUE MILITANT GROUP


1172
01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:03.219
HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THE ICE
TURNS THE SATELLITE ON,


1173
01:20:03.252 --> 01:20:04.987
SAY, UH, MECCA,

1174
01:20:05.021 --> 01:20:08.057
I THINK IT COULD BE A VERY
DIFFERENT STORY, DON'T YOU?


1175
01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:09.425
YOU DO THIS
AND YOU COULD START A WAR.


1176
01:20:11.294 --> 01:20:13.963
THERE'S GONNA BE A WAR
SOONER OR LATER ANYWAY.


1177
01:20:13.996 --> 01:20:15.665
SOME OF US ARE SICK
OF BEING GUESTS


1178
01:20:15.698 --> 01:20:16.966
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S COUNTRIES.

1179
01:20:16.999 --> 01:20:18.935
NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE BE A DEAR

1180
01:20:18.968 --> 01:20:22.371
AND REDIRECT SolStar-2
ACCORDING TO THESE COORDINATES?


1181
01:20:37.653 --> 01:20:38.654
- HEY.

1182
01:20:38.688 --> 01:20:41.123
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY.

1183
01:20:42.592 --> 01:20:45.995
THAT'S IT? A SHRUG?

1184
01:20:46.028 --> 01:20:47.697
A NOD. OKAY.

1185
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:51.634
NOW, A NOD'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

1186
01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:53.402
SAS, YOU KNOW BETTER.

1187
01:20:53.436 --> 01:20:56.072
COME ON.

1188
01:20:56.105 --> 01:20:57.039
SHH.

1189
01:20:59.141 --> 01:21:00.977
SAS.

1190
01:21:11.988 --> 01:21:14.724
Do you know what happens
if I lose my patience?


1191
01:21:14.757 --> 01:21:16.058
- You'll shoot me?

1192
01:21:16.092 --> 01:21:17.526
- Very good.

1193
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:23.499
AND IN YOUR CASE,
I'LL ACTUALLY ENJOY IT.


1194
01:21:42.184 --> 01:21:43.753
- But then you won't have anyone

1195
01:21:43.786 --> 01:21:45.721
to control
the satellite for you.


1196
01:21:45.755 --> 01:21:48.124
- OH, YOU SEE, HERE'S THE THING.

1197
01:21:48.157 --> 01:21:52.461
IF I KILL YOU AND THERE'S NO ONE
LEFT TO CONTROL THE SATELLITE,


1198
01:21:52.495 --> 01:21:54.063
I'LL JUST GO HOME.

1199
01:21:54.096 --> 01:21:56.699
I'LL HAVE SAVED THE WORLD,
SO I'LL BE A HERO.


1200
01:21:56.732 --> 01:21:58.668
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO GET HOME?


1201
01:21:58.701 --> 01:22:00.269
THE TRUCKS ARE GONE.

1202
01:22:00.303 --> 01:22:02.571
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.


1203
01:22:02.605 --> 01:22:04.707
On the other hand,
if you help me fry the Arabs


1204
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.742
then the people
that sent me on this mission,


1205
01:22:06.776 --> 01:22:08.444
they're gonna
pay me $10 million.


1206
01:22:08.477 --> 01:22:09.679
I THINK THAT SHOULD
JUST ABOUT BE ENOUGH


1207
01:22:09.712 --> 01:22:11.380
TO BUY MYSELF
A PLACE IN THE SUN.


1208
01:22:14.116 --> 01:22:16.319
- SHIT.

1209
01:22:28.631 --> 01:22:30.399
- I need the manual.

1210
01:22:30.433 --> 01:22:31.634
- WHAT DO YOU THE MANUAL FOR?

1211
01:22:31.667 --> 01:22:33.436
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
HOW THIS WORKED.


1212
01:22:33.469 --> 01:22:35.571
I HAVEN'T USED THIS PROGRAM
FOR THREE YEARS.


1213
01:22:35.604 --> 01:22:37.406
HINTZE DID
SOME MODIFICATIONS, OKAY?


1214
01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.276
NO, NO, NO. SIT DOWN.
I'LL GET IT. WHERE IS IT?


1215
01:22:40.309 --> 01:22:41.610
- OVER THERE.

1216
01:22:45.414 --> 01:22:47.149
- KEEP WORKING.

1217
01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:15.211
- ANNA, YOU ALL RIGHT?

1218
01:23:15.244 --> 01:23:16.579
- OH, SHE'S JUST FINE, PARKER.

1219
01:23:16.612 --> 01:23:18.481
NOW, DROP YOUR GUN
AND SHE WON'T GET HURT.


1220
01:23:18.514 --> 01:23:21.417
HENLEY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?


1221
01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:23.085
AAH!

1222
01:23:23.119 --> 01:23:25.087
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

1223
01:23:26.322 --> 01:23:29.225
THAT WAS JUST A FLESH WOUND.
THE NEXT ONE WON'T BE.


1224
01:23:29.258 --> 01:23:33.262
NOW, REDIRECT MY SATELLITE,
OTHERWISE I'LL SHOOT HIM!


1225
01:23:34.563 --> 01:23:35.631
GET RID OF THE GUN.

1226
01:23:38.634 --> 01:23:42.204
JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE,
OTHERWISE I'LL SHOOT HER.


1227
01:23:43.572 --> 01:23:45.541
YOU KNOW, THOUGH,
TWO AGAINST ONE


1228
01:23:45.574 --> 01:23:47.777
KIND OF STILL
SEEMS UNFAIR, DOESN'T IT?


1229
01:23:51.213 --> 01:23:53.182
I ONLY FUCKED YOU
TO SCREW WITH YOUR HEAD.


1230
01:23:53.215 --> 01:23:55.217
BUT ACTUALLY, IT TURNED OUT
TO BE QUITE ENJOYABLE.


1231
01:23:59.255 --> 01:24:00.556
NOW, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS,


1232
01:24:00.589 --> 01:24:01.757
BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

1233
01:24:01.791 --> 01:24:04.493
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO DO.


1234
01:24:13.369 --> 01:24:15.404
STOP!

1235
01:24:16.705 --> 01:24:18.374
AAH!

1236
01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.757
OH, TOM,
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.


1237
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:36.759
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO END UP
LOSING ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL,


1238
01:24:36.792 --> 01:24:38.594
NOW, WOULD YOU?

1239
01:24:56.779 --> 01:24:59.548
- AAAAAAAAH!

1240
01:25:26.242 --> 01:25:28.577
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

1241
01:25:28.611 --> 01:25:30.746
IT LOOKS LIKE WE WEREN'T
THE ONLY ONES


1242
01:25:30.779 --> 01:25:32.915
TRYING TO GET
CONTROL OF SolStar-2.


1243
01:25:32.948 --> 01:25:34.283
- YEAH, NO KIDDING.

1244
01:25:37.286 --> 01:25:41.524
LET'S KILL THIS SATELLITE
AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.


1245
01:25:41.557 --> 01:25:42.791
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

1246
01:25:43.993 --> 01:25:46.662
WHAT'S THAT?
- MY FATHER'S IDEA.


1247
01:25:46.695 --> 01:25:49.865
INCIDENTAL CALCULATIONS.
IT COULD WORK.


1248
01:25:49.899 --> 01:25:52.935
SolStar-2 CAN
KICKSTART THE WEATHER.


1249
01:25:52.968 --> 01:25:55.771
- HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE?

1250
01:25:55.804 --> 01:25:58.674
- ALL CALCULATIONS ARE DONE.

1251
01:25:58.707 --> 01:26:01.277
WE JUST HAVE TO TRY IT.

1252
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:02.978
- OKAY. GOOD. LET'S DO IT.

1253
01:26:03.012 --> 01:26:05.614
WHAT ABOUT THE ORDER
THAT WE HAVE


1254
01:26:05.648 --> 01:26:07.983
TO DESTROY SolStar-2
AT ANY COST?


1255
01:26:08.017 --> 01:26:10.886
- I TRUST YOU.

1256
01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.021
- OKAY.

1257
01:26:22.364 --> 01:26:24.767
OH, SHIT.

1258
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.669
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1259
01:26:26.702 --> 01:26:29.605
THE DISH ON THE ROOF
IS DISCONNECTED.


1260
01:26:29.638 --> 01:26:30.673
- ALL RIGHT.

1261
01:26:30.706 --> 01:26:32.575
I'LL GO CONNECT THE DISH.

1262
01:26:32.608 --> 01:26:34.944
YOU KEEP DOING YOUR THING.
- ARE YOU SURE?


1263
01:26:34.977 --> 01:26:36.912
YEAH, YOU HAVE TO
PROGRAM THE SATELLITE.


1264
01:26:36.946 --> 01:26:38.948
- OKAY.

1265
01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:16.685
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THAT EASY, YEAH?


1266
01:27:29.698 --> 01:27:31.767
BYE, PARKER.

1267
01:28:06.101 --> 01:28:09.638
SO, YOU'RE MAKING A HABIT
OF SAVING MY LIFE.


1268
01:28:09.672 --> 01:28:11.874
I GUESS YOU OWE ME.

1269
01:28:11.907 --> 01:28:14.677
LET ME KNOW
HOW I CAN REPAY YOU.


1270
01:28:14.710 --> 01:28:17.846
- LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

1271
01:30:17.933 --> 01:30:20.903
"I DON'T KNOW
IF ANYONE IS GETTING THROUGH,


1272
01:30:20.936 --> 01:30:22.571
"BUT THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE.

1273
01:30:22.604 --> 01:30:23.672
"THE SUN IS SETTING,

1274
01:30:23.705 --> 01:30:26.875
"AND I'M GOING TO JOIN
OUR LITTLE PRINCESS IN BED.


1275
01:30:26.909 --> 01:30:29.878
"THE NIGHTS ARE BITTERLY COLD
AND GETTING COLDER.


1276
01:30:29.912 --> 01:30:33.916
"HOLDING HER IN MY ARMS BRINGS
US BOTH WARMTH AND COMFORT.


1277
01:30:33.949 --> 01:30:34.983
"I LOVE YOU.

1278
01:30:35.017 --> 01:30:37.019
MORE LATER. SANDRA."

1279
01:32:18.921 --> 01:32:20.923
- I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

1280
01:32:23.425 --> 01:32:25.627
NOW IT'S REAL.

1281
01:32:28.096 --> 01:32:32.935
IF THIS WORKS OUT, THERE WILL
BE A LOT TO DO AROUND HERE.


1282
01:32:52.721 --> 01:32:55.891
LOOKS LIKE
YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE IT.


1283
01:32:55.924 --> 01:32:57.125
- LET'S HOPE.

1284
01:32:59.995 --> 01:33:03.398
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

1285
01:33:03.432 --> 01:33:06.034
THAT'S THE SUN.
