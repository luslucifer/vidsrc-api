Oh. Fuck.

7
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.337
Sir, you were driving erratically back there.

8
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.380
I'm gonna be honest with you, okay.
I kind of got swept up in the music and...


9
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.141
You know, I got swept up.
I was swept. I got swept up.


10
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.335
Sir, step out of the car.

11
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.412
Have you ever performed a field sobriety test?

12
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.651
What?

13
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.858
- Just put one foot in front of the other.
- Yeah.


14
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.251
Heel-to-toe, for nine steps.

15
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.696
One foot and extend
your arms to the side.

16
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.374
Can you do that?

17
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.933
I'm sober! I can't do it!

18
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.375
No shaking.

19
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.491
Look, this is not easy.
You can do it 'cause you've practiced.


20
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.652
- Come with me.
- What?


21
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.340
Sir, you are clearly intoxicated.

22
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.174
I'm not! I wasn't drinking. 
I was just happy.

23
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.457
Is that the penalty for being happy?

24
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.375
The head, the head, the precious head.

25
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.015
Don't hurt the head.

26
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.659
- Hey, Nathan.
- Hey, Ben.


27
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.777
How are you, man?

28
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.774
What a fucked up morning I had.

29
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.619
- Today? This morning?
- Yeah, this morning.


30
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.976
Unbelievable.

31
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.098
Hey, did you hear
Haney's gonna use one of my ideas


32
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.251
in the big presentation today.

33
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.820
- Is that right?
- Yeah, how about that, huh?


34
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.494
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.


35
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.772
Your mother must be so proud of you.

36
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.138
- Well...
- "Ben got something in the presentation.


37
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.577
- "We're so proud of him."
- It's... (CHUCKLES) Yeah.


38
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.493
- "Did you hear?"
- I hope Haney likes it.


39
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.095
Did you see? His son
is in the office today.

40
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.456
- Is that right?
- Yeah, Howard.


41
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.694
He named his son after Howard Roark
from Ayn Rand's <i>The Fountainhead.</i>


42
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.932
- Howard Roark.
- I never read it.


43
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.819
As far as I'm concerned,
he's probably the biggest asshole


44
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.858
in the history of literature,
and then you name your kid...


45
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.580
- Why would you do that?
- Oh, Jesus.


46
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.130
- Are you all right down there?
- This just drives me crazy.


47
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.177
What?

48
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.140
I'm sick of these
outlets always on the floor.

49
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.258
Every time I try and plug something in,

50
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.618
I have to move furniture,
and I strain my back.

51
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.852
Why can't outlets be up here?

52
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.217
- At eye level.
- Eye level?


53
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.134
What are they, like genitals?
We have to hide them?


54
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.780
Why are we hiding outlets?

55
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.693
- Think about it.
- Yeah. It's a...


56
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.260
- See you later.
- Okay.


57
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.695
Good to see you, boss. 
Good luck today.

58
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.295
Hey. Ben, how are you? 
Where you been?

59
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.380
(CHUCKLES) I had a little problem
this morning.


60
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.851
- It's... Crazy.
- Big day today.


61
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.500
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

62
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.254
Okay.

63
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.300
Is that new?

64
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.295
No. I've had it for a while.

65
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.016
That's a Plepler, he paints shopping carts.

66
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.014
As a kid, I
was fascinated by shopping carts

67
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.013
because you get to drive them
in the supermarket.


68
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.570
It's quite beautiful.
I can't believe I never noticed that before.


69
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.381
Something about the shopping cart
I find mesmerizing.


70
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.940
Hey, look who's here!

71
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.900
Hi, buddy. How ya doing?
How are you doing?


72
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.460
You wanna meet Mr. Flomm?

73
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.055
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.


74
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.859
Nathan, this is my son, Howard.

75
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.819
- Hello.
- This is our nanny, Marina.


76
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.130
- Marina, this is Nathan Flomm.
- Marina?


77
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.621
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.


78
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.456
I like that, that swirl
you got on your hair there.


79
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.975
Thank you. It takes a few hours.

80
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.939
- Huh? It takes a few hours.
- It takes a few hours.


81
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.978
What do you do about the shampooing?

82
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.253
(SIGHS) Once a week.

83
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.617
- You shampoo once a week.
- Once a week when I do it.


84
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.534
You may wanna consider
going twice, you know.


85
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.011
That's a long time to go without shampooing.

86
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.251
But this takes two hours.

87
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.014
Try a second shampoo.

88
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.013
Take a little tip, little tip.

89
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.091
He's a full-time job.

90
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.252
She's a very valuable member of our family.

91
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.094
Wonderful caregiver.

92
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.219
Will you do me a favor and take Howard out
to the front desk and wait for me there.


93
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.655
You need to get in there.

94
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.970
I wanna say goodbye
before he goes to school.


95
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.939
I'm... Every day.

96
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.739
Okay, buddy. Will you
wait for me out there?

97
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.936
- Okay.
- All right.


98
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.774
- Bye. Nice to meet you.
- Love you.


99
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.261
Isn't he cute?

100
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.936
She's shampooing once a week,
are you kidding me?


101
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.092
- (APPLAUSE)
- WILL: Congratulations to Andy Matsin.


102
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.419
Good job.
Also to Mark and his aerodynamics team


103
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.221
for perfecting the exterior profile of the car

104
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.454
and reducing the drag coefficient
to a very slippery 0.23.


105
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.419
- (APPLAUSE)
- Very good job, Mark.


106
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.414
So I've answered
all the tough questions about the car.


107
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.857
Is it safer? Is it more efficient?

108
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.456
Can it travel further on a single charge

109
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.534
than any other production
electric vehicle out there?


110
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.779
Yes, yes, and yes.

111
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.137
So there's probably one more question
that you all have.


112
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.374
What's the name?

113
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.417
What are we gonna
call this bold new vision?

114
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.812
It's a name that instantly defines our product.

115
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.574
Ladies and gentlemen...

116
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.652
The Howard.

117
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.098
(APPLAUSE)

118
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.331
Brilliant.

119
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.139
- Are you kidding?
- WILL: Thank you very much.


120
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.380
- The Howard? Honestly?
- WILL: The Howard. Yes.


121
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.498
- That's what we're calling this?
- Yes.


122
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.733
I'm sorry.
I got a real problem with this name, man.


123
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.212
- BEN: Oh, God, Nathan.
- Howard? You can't...


124
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.736
You can't call a car Howard.

125
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.017
Come on. Seriously.

126
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.900
I tell you what.
Everybody, let's reconvene in 15.


127
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.859
Nathan and I are gonna
have a quick discussion


128
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.695
about the marketing of this.
Let's move forward.


129
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.898
NATHAN: Do you like this name?
MAN: It's a great name, man.


130
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.291
WILL: Grab that door
on your way out. Hey.

131
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.371
(DOOR CLOSES)

132
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.259
All right. Let me just say this, okay.

133
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.061
You brought me into this company
for my marketing expertise, correct?


134
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.859
- Yes.
- Okay.


135
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.701
I hate to toot my own horn,
but you know I was the brains


136
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.215
behind the Edible Arrangements.

137
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.011
1,030% growth in three fiscal quarters.

138
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.660
- I'm aware.
- I'm not making that up.


139
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.181
Call Patrick Lyons, he'll tell you...

140
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.378
Nathan, I'm aware of your success.

141
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.293
It's why we hired you.

142
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.295
Okay. You're making it impossible
for me to market this car. I can't do it.


143
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.213
Nobody's gonna buy a car named Howard.

144
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.292
It's like naming a restaurant Hepatitis.

145
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.775
- It's a name.
- It's not a good name.


146
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.932
Call it a Dewey. 
That's a good name.

147
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.058
A Duncan. Call it Duncan.

148
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.371
Nathan, your job
is to come up with the marketing.


149
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.896
Marketers market. 
Inventors invent.

150
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.210
It's a slam-dunk.

151
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.577
- By the way, what happened to the pee flap?
- The pee flap...


152
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.496
Nathan, are you still
on this horrible idea, the pee flap?


153
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.574
- I thought you were into it?
- It's an insane idea.


154
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.132
- Everybody wants to pee in their car.
- Nobody wants to pee in their car.


155
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.417
- I wanna pee in my car.
- You'd get pee all over yourself.


156
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.937
No, the tube comes up high enough
that it will catch everything.


157
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.775
Nathan, everybody's different.
How big is the tube?


158
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.660
You put your balls and your penis in the tube
and that's that.


159
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.734
And you have different size pee tubes
if you happen to have big genitals.


160
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.096
What about the liability?

161
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.379
What happens if you hit a bump
with your dick and balls in a tube


162
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.293
and you... It chops it off?

163
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.896
So people sign a little waiver or something.
Big deal.


164
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.654
Nathan, it's a... 
What do women do?

165
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.494
What do women do? 
Half of our market?

166
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.819
All right. So women
don't have to use it.

167
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.894
You can't turn the interior of a car
into a urinal.


168
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.661
Bad idea. The car is perfect.

169
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.971
I'm sure I could've
worked something out for women.


170
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.291
Nathan, your job is to sell it,

171
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.021
and if you can't do that job,
we're gonna find somebody else that can.


172
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.731
You are invested in this company.
You have 1 <i>0%</i> of this company.


173
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:22.690
You wanna walk away from that?

174
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.659
Are you offering me my 1 <i>0%</i> back?

175
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.891
I will happily give
you your 1 <i>0%</i> back.

176
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.219
You have a deal.

177
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.814
- You're making a huge mistake.
- I think you're making a mistake.


178
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.972
It's the worst decision
you've ever made in your life.


179
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.621
You made the worst decision. Howard.

180
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.130
How beautiful is this?

181
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.941
I don't think that salmon
was wild, by the way.

182
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.132
- Did you see this?
- MAN: Oh, my God, that's beautiful.


183
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:52.250
We have a rosewater-infused,
white chocolate soufflĂ©,


184
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.458
with an almond chutney.

185
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.654
And here we have the raspberry
and chocolate mousse


186
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.570
with a kola nut
and cocoa mousse in the center.


187
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.178
- Kola nut?
- Yes, kola nut. Enjoy.


188
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.254
I was... I was walking down Castro Street,

189
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.573
and this fat woman is coming toward me

190
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.371
and she bumps me with her stomach
and knocks me off the curb.


191
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.134
It was hilarious.

192
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.939
What is... What did you do to her?

193
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.375
- NATHAN: Out of the clear blue sky...
- Are you okay?


194
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.861
NATHAN: Yeah, of course, I'm okay.
It was funny.


195
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.137
There was a cop, saw the whole thing,
he was laughing.


196
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.292
This city, what's happening is disgusting.

197
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.101
These homeless people,
the hospitals are releasing them...


198
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.695
- It's so sad.
- MAN: They're in Mountain View now.


199
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.341
It's not sad. It's a funny story.

200
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.220
- I just don't understand...
- NATHAN: You don't think that's funny?


201
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.019
A fat woman just
hits me off the road...

202
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.378
- If you say fat again...
- NATHAN: Oh, you can't say fat.


203
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.214
You can't say fat.

204
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.213
What is going on with Electron Motors?

205
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.054
I'm very excited
about the electric car coming out.


206
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.053
Oh, my gosh. You have no idea.

207
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.939
They doubled that battery life.
Did you know that?


208
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.536
- They have doubled that battery life.
- What?


209
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.533
- You're sitting on a fortune.
- That thing is gonna be huge.


210
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.534
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, well, there's a problem.


211
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.574
GINA: With the car?

212
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.374
- I'm out of the company.
- What?


213
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.496
Yeah. There was a presentation today

214
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.451
and he revealed
that the name of the car is Howard,


215
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.419
and I had a big problem with that.

216
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.300
And he said, "If you don't like it,
you can sell back your shares, " and I did.


217
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.214
- No, you didn't. Please tell me you're joking.
- No. I'm not joking.


218
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.894
Because he named his car Howard?
This is a joke?


219
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.940
You can't name a car Howard.
It's just not a name of a car.


220
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.810
Honey, enough about the name.
Let's get back to the shares, okay?


221
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.179
You have to go back
and get your shares back.


222
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.214
I actually love the name Howard.

223
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.816
I do. I was thinking
about the name last night.

224
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.655
Howard's a solid name. 
Howard's a good guy.

225
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.700
There's a lot of good Howards.
They're average.


226
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.535
They're an average guy doing average things.

227
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.740
And this is the campaign.

228
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.576
Solid, dependable, trustworthy,
that's our Howard.


229
00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.418
The name that yesterday you had nothing
but disparaging comments about.


230
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.892
I'm really sorry. I am. I'm sorry.

231
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.292
Yeah. Sounds to me like
you're sorry you fucked up,


232
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.021
but not, you know,

233
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.774
not for what's underneath it.

234
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.501
I apologized. That's what's important.

235
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.221
It doesn't matter if you apologize
if it's not sincere.


236
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.492
Apologies don't have to be sincere.

237
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.857
It's just the act of the apology itself.

238
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.139
It's only...
All that matters is if you're acting sincere.


239
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.174
That is literally the only thing
an apology has to be,


240
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.331
is sincere.

241
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.855
Oh, God, Will, 
I completely...

242
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.501
- Otherwise, it's just words.
- I'm acting sincere.


243
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.220
Of course, I don't believe it.

244
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.931
Here at this company, we believe in sincerity.

245
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.496
You had the opportunity
to meet my son yesterday,


246
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.698
the one thing in the world
that I happen to care about


247
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:45.857
more than this company.

248
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.171
What did you do? 
Do you remember?

249
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.016
You talked about his nanny's hair
and how much it might stink.


250
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.219
Nope. Never said the nanny's hair stunk.

251
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.338
I never said that. 
I never said it stunk.

252
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.531
You know what you didn't say?

253
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.021
- What?
- "Cute kid."


254
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.660
- I was gonna get to that.
- "What a nice son.


255
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.939
"What a great job you did raising your son
as a single parent.


256
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.490
"What a nice job,
seems like a good kid."

257
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.335
You know what, you don't get to that.
You lead with it.


258
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.653
How could you lead with it
if somebody's shampooing once a week?


259
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.858
Janine has your severance package
at the front desk.


260

Your things have been packed up.

261
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.061
You can tell the delivery company
to take them wherever you need them to be.


262
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.858
I'm sorry it had to be like this.

263
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.532
Are you sorry? 
Are you really sorry?

264
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.292
- No.
- You see?


265
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.974
You did the exact same thing I did.

266
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.972
You apologized, but you didn't mean it.

267
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.813
Janine has your things.
The delivery guys need an address.


268
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.296
You know, I was an early investor
in this company.


269
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.772
I believe in this car.
I thought we were good friends.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:04.697
CONAN: <i>You think you had a bad day?</i>
<i>This guy lost a billion dollars.</i>


304
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.894
<i>He lost a billion,
but don't worry about him.</i>

305
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.814
<i>What little money he had left,
he invested in Enron.</i>


306
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:11.891
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

307
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.417
(GRUNTS)

308
00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.776
Thank you, Rolly.

309
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.412
And I got you a little pickle.

310
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.251
A pickle.

311
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.334
Half sweet, half sour. 
Just like you.

312
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.339
I don't eat pickles.

313
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.937
You've been working for me nine years.
You should know that, Rolly.


314
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.660
- You drive me crazy.
- (LAUGHS) I drive you crazy?


315
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.256
- I just wanna eat in peace.
- What do you think you're doing to me?


316
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.014
Here. You don't want the pickle?

317
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.774
- I'll take the pickle. Okay?
- Please.


318
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.535
Yeah, get it out of my sight.
And don't eat it in front of me.


319
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.459
- Oh, my God.
- It makes me sick.


320
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.532
I'm gonna tell you something, it's fantastic.

321
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.135
I hope you choke on it.

322
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.333
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

323
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.777
<i>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah</i>

324
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.661
No. Oh, dear...

325
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.257
Oh, gee.

326
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.697
- Just for you.
- Oh, gosh.


327
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:48.976
That was quite awful.

328
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.540
It's your birthday.

329
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.580
I'm really looking forward to getting wasted
with somebody who's turning 90.


330
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.937
- That's gonna be a first for me.
- That's really sweet of you.


331
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.331
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna watch <i>Cocoon?</i>


332
00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.696
- Okay. That's good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.


333
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.772
- Yeah.
- Let's go. Come on.


334
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.659
- Nathan Flomm, marketing.
- What?


335
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.973
- Who's that?
- Oh, uh... Yeah, a guy.


336
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.570
The old owner must have left it
in the closet or something.


337
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.096
I don't know. What's the plan?
North Oak Tavern?


338
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.537
That's the plan. Beer's on me.

339
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.741
What do you think?

340
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.659
- A Howard?
- Yup.


341
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.420
Half the people on the island drive this.

342
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.174
Why should I be the only
asshole paying for gas.


343
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.331
(CHUCKLES)

344
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.333
Let's take my car.

345
00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.741
Why would we take your car?
I got a brand-new car.


346
00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.778
I wanna drive you
in it tonight. Come on.

347
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.659
I'd really rather we take my car.

348
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.255
Come on. Get in. We're going.
I'm gonna show it to you.


349
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.616
Do you see how the doors open up?

350
00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.852
I know how they open
up, it was my idea.

351
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.170
What do you mean, it was your idea?

352
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.056
Well, I mean, you know,
I had that idea a long time ago.


353
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.531
Well, then you should sue the company.

354
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.454
- Watch this.
- COMPUTERIZED VOICE: <i>Hi, Frank.</i>


355
00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.371
I'm ready, ready for a
nice big meal on you.

356
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.259
- Oh, on me?
- Absolutely.


357
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.981
I said one drink.
I didn't say drinking for the whole night.


358
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.291
What? Are you kidding? 
It's my birthday.

359
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.974
You have to pay for my... Come on.

360
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:11.654
ALL: Surprise!

361
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.731
(GROANS)

362
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.652
JASPAR: My fucking nose!

363
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.852
- I'm so sorry.
- WOMAN: Oh, Rolly...


364
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.500
Who is this guy?

365
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.618
- ROLLY: Look, you know...
- You got me.


366
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.739
I'm really sorry.
Honestly, I just got frightened, I guess.


367
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.019
I saw a face and I lashed out.

368
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.854
You're frightened of a black man. Just say...

369
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.295
- (SPEAKING GIBBERISH)
- I don't think so.


370
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.179
I don't think I was frightened
of the black man. No.


371
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.695
It could've been any black
person standing there.


372
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.694
It could've been a black old lady
saying, "Hey, surprise."


373
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:38.931
Are you gonna punch her
in the fucking nose?


374
00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.341
- I don't...
- A little kid?


375
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.492
A dwarf, a black dwarf?
Have you ever seen a black dwarf?


376
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:45.460
Yeah. I would've punched
a white dwarf, too, and a white old lady.


377
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.691
You wouldn't have punched a white dwarf.

378
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.260
No one punches white dwarfs.
They play around.


379
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.651
They pick them up.
You never punch a white dwarf in the face.


380
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.779
- What, I have dwarf racism?
- Of course, there's always dwarf racism.


381
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.614
So you mean the white dwarf
is cuddly and cute...


382
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.977
- White people are afraid of black dwarfs.
- I don't know.


383
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.496
I would find a black dwarf
just as cuddly as the white dwarf.


384
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.856
I think you're way off base there.

385
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.773
You'd pick them up
and punch them in the fucking face.


386
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.571
I'm really sorry, and I beg your forgiveness.

387
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.936
We're good?

388
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.820
Very nice.

389
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.176
Honestly, you guys are great.

390
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.174
ALL: Happy birthday, Rolly!
CARL: To my boy Rolly.


391
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.139
Okay. All right. Okay.

392
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.611
- Pretty good party.
- Rolly deserves it.


393
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.977
You know a lot of
people come into my diner,

394
00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.055
I gotta tell you, that Rolly DaVore
is the nicest guy I know.


395
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.459
(LAUGHS) Yeah. 
Happy birthday.

396
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.572
- Thank you.
- Here, it's for you.


397
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.493
Oh, Wendy.

398
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.572
You know, that's one of
the benefits of breaking up,


399
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.493
I didn't have to
spend as much this year.

400
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.937
Looks like you didn't spend anything.

401
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.696
I didn't. Yeah, I just was cleaning out
my drawer at home.


402
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.135
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

403
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.618
How's the job hunt, anything?

404
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.091
(SIGHS) Still looking. 
There's nothing.

405
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.015
I gotta get out of that diner.

406
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.821
I smell like fried clams. 
I can't take it.

407
00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.496
- Well, I'll keep my ears open.
- Thanks, thanks.


408
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.459
Cake, there's gonna be cake, right?

409
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.500
- I guess.
- Okay. Some dancing?


410
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.857
- No.
- Yeah, come on. (GRUNTS)


411
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:08.981
Pussy.

412
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.336
You can't sleep
in the same bed with a woman?


413
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.697
No. I mean, I enjoy the sex part,

414
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.535
but the sleeping part I'm not good at.

415
00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.374
I need the space in the bed,

416
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.176
and I feel like the air is contaminated
from the breathing.


417
00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.093
They're shedding skin cells.

418
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.660
Skin cells?
What are you, a fucking microscope?


419
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.495
I just wanna close my eyes and go to bed.
What else is there to do?


420
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.891
Happy birthday, Rolly.

421
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.335
(LAUGHS)

422
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.050
It's Jennifer.

423
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.700
Are you kidding me?

424
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.057
No, I'm not kidding you. 
I lost a lot of weight.

425
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.019
I just can't get over what I'm seeing.

426
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.661
It's me, it's just
a lot less of me.

427
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.061
That is incredible.

428
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.213
It is incredible. 
It changed my life, Rolly.

429
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.530
Everything good. 
I got a new job.

430
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.897
I got... I'm engaged to be married.

431
00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.696
Really?

432
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.010
I'm engaged to be married, yeah.

433
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.740
I'm surprised.

434
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.016
Why?

435
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.536
You know, you could have
a lot of suitors now.


436
00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.932
Go off and get engaged
to the first guy you meet?


437
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.739
You're in demand.

438
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.294
Did he like you when you were fat?

439
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.372
He never talked to
me when I was fat.

440
00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.294
(SNICKERS) Okay, there you go.
See, he's superficial, just like me.


441
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.418
I wouldn't have dated you
when you were fat either.


442
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.891
- I'm sorry to say.
- What a terrible thing to say.


443
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.331
Yeah, I know, it's terrible but it's true.
It's true.


444
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.576
Who is he?

445
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.061
His name is Jaspar.

446
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.371
He's the guy you... (CLICKS TONGUE)
In the face when you walked in.


447
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.373
He's the guy over there.

448
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.690
(LAUGHING)

449
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.621
- Hey.
- Hey.


450
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.977
- Rolly, how are you?
- Hi, Carl.


451
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.893
Did you get that
birthday e-mail I sent you?

452
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.860
Well, you know, Carl,
generally, I gotta tell you,

the silverware on the table.

- My rags aren't dirty.

But I'm sure you'll recall
that a few years ago,

855
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:05.935
I found your dog, in the woods,
behind my house


856
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.617
and at the risk of my own personal safety,
I brought it back.


857

I fed it and gave
him the rest of my meatloaf.

858
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:15.617
And he had a baked potato.
I didn't know dogs ate baked potatoes.


859
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.421
And then we sat down
and we watched an episode of <i>Law & Order.</i>


860
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.219
And I fell asleep with
that poor dog in my arms.


861
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.621
And he must've had some dog dream

862
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.136
because I woke up
and he was twitching and going like that.

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:02.818
Oh! It was a great show.
They put on a great show.


907
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:03.937
- Really?
- Yeah.


908
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:08.060
And did you, by any chance,
blow them afterwards?


909
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.856
MCKENZIE: Yeah, let's really
get cracking on this wall, guys.


910
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.581
I wanna see you fitting,
and I wanna see you chipping,


911
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.220
I wanna see you on the machine.

912
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.339
I wanna see some real work
done on that wall today...


913
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:46.893
So, so sorry. Gentlemen, so sorry I'm late.

914
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.060
Trying to take a shower,
hot water didn't come on.


915
00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.571
Waiting, waiting.
You know what I'm talking about?


916
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.254
Feeling, testing, feeling, testing.

917
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.818
The hot water, it takes
a year to get hot.

918
00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.099
I think you better put this on
while you're out here, okay?


919
00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:05.854
- Okay, you guys, let's go.
- Really? Look at this. Huh?


920
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.171
- Okay, guys, let's get to work.
- Come on, get to work.


921
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:09.490
Take a walk with me, will you?

922
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.015
Remember Lee J. 
Cobb, <i>On the Waterfront?</i>

923
00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:14.014
"Get to work! You get to work!"

924
00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.615
Never saw it.

925
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.534
Look, I think I
got a job for you.

926
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:18.896
- Yeah.
- It's not easy.


927
00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:21.814
I want you to finish assembling
this swing set, all right?


928
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.973
First thing you gotta do,
dig some holes, put some concrete in there,


929
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.620
then put your four-by-four in there.

930
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.375
- Nothing to it. Add water to that...
- (MUTTERING) That...


931
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.691
Yeah, yeah.
And then just put it in the hole, okay?


932
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.260
- Okay.
- Okay.


933
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.094
I'll check in on you later.

934
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.581
- No need.
- No, no.


935
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.698
- No need, I'm good. No need.
- No. I'll check back.


936
00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.534
Don't come back!

937
00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:47.815

938
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:01.855
Hey!

939
00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.655
McKenzie!

940
00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:05.257
Wee!

941
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.371
(GRUNTS)

942
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.100
Oh, fuck!

943
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.060
Excuse me. Where's the bathroom?

944
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.661
Mr. Cesspool.

945
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.211
(TOILET FLUSHING)

946
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:30.652
Excuse me. Sorry. 
Are you the heating guy?

947
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:35.734
I'm not the heating guy
per se, but I do heat.

948
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.580
So you can look at my system.

949
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:38.976
- Sure. Yeah.
- Great.


950
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:40.461
Thank you so much.

951
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.618
I've been having real issues with it...

952
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.419
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Watch the cord here


953
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.540
because I can't seem to get behind the couch
for the outlet.


954
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.055
You got an outlet behind the couch?

955
00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:52.258
They're always behind the furniture.

956
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:53.735
- Not in my house.
- Really?


957
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.893
In my house, my outlets are eye level.

958
00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.294
There's no bending down.
There's no moving furniture.


959
00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:02.099
There's no injuring backs.

960
00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.537
Okay. That's a great idea.

961
00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.055
I'm gonna talk to McKenzie about that.

962
00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.701
- You don't... You don't need to talk to him.
- Yeah, no, I think I should.


963
00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.977
- You know what? I'll mention it to him.
- Okay, great.


964
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.018
- Yeah, don't talk to him...
- Okay, please do.


965
00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:16.537
- So listen, this is what happens here.
- Uh-huh.


966
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:17.936
Yeah.

967
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:20.331
See that.
That's the temperature it stays at all the time,


968
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.254
- so whether it's cool or whether it's hot.
- Uh-huh.


969
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:28.021
So it just stays there.
It doesn't matter if it's on 68 or 78,


970
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:29.660
it just is always that temperature.

971
00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.859
And I have no idea why... 
There's an asterisk,

972
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:33.977
I don't know why...

973
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.859
The asterisk, it's a sort of a warning.

974
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.696
It's saying, "We're coming on.
Get ready, we're gonna be warm soon."


975
00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.250
Or "We're gonna be cooler, " you know.

976
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.855
Can we just fix it?

977
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.812
I'm on it. On it.

978
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:49.534
- WILL: Rhonda!
- Yeah?


979
00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:51.260
- I'm sorry. Hold on.
- Rhonda!


980
00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:54.652
Hey, have you seen my gray jacket,
the new one that I just got with a black liner?


981
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.250
No. But why don't
you put on the seersucker.

982
00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:58.855
I got it for
your birthday, it looks so...

983
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.216
I would put the seersucker jacket on,

984
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.452
but my barbershop quartet
license just expired.


985
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.493
Well, you don't need to take
that kind of attitude.


986
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.174
- Rhonda!
- RHONDA: You know I don't like that.


987
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.981
I don't like it either.
I've had it with this whole thing.


988
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:10.575
- Don't you talk like that...
- We're done!


989
00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.301
- Will, open the door.
- No, no!


990
00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:15.930
Will, you've got to stop doing this.

991
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:18.099
(ARGUING CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

992
00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.575
I was coming out of the bathroom
and she asked me if I was the heating guy


993
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:31.981
and now I'm in the house.

994
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.132
- That's great.
- Well done, newcomer.


995
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.371
Thank you, Stumpo.

996
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.134
- I'm proud of you.
- Stumpo's proud of me.


997
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.657
He's never proud of people.
He doesn't dole out compliments.


998
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.256
I don't like anybody.
Go ahead with your story, though.


999
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:44.741
It's not really a story.

1000
00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.574
I'm just saying I'm in the house.

1001
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:48.573
- Yeah.
- That's the end of the story.


1002
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:50.812
It's not a story. 
I didn't say it was a story.

1003
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.496
- It's kind of a story.
- It's a nice story.


1004
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:55.971
Anyway, this is perfect.

1005
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.098
She's complained about the heating system.

1006
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.656
We'll make it look like a gas explosion.

1007
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:02.858
We already have an alibi.

1008
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:06.651
Hey, by the way,
did you ever hear a rumor about Wendy


1009
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.376
blowing Chicago 20 years ago
when they were here?


1010
00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.293
Oh, yeah, she did.

1011
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.372
Yep. That's a fact.

1012
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.861
How do you know this?

1013
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.020
My sister was there, saw it happen.
She blew them, too.


1014
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.741
How is Roberta doing?

1015
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.574
- She's doing good.
- That's great.


1016
00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:24.739
Yeah. Now, you're gonna need a detonator.

1017
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.737
- I have to get the detonator?
- You gotta get a detonator.


1018
00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.812
- I'm not involved in this.
- Yeah.


1019
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:32.621
I made the introductions,
but I was under the impression


1020
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.091
that you guys were taking care
of all that kind of shit.


1021
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.820
Well, you're under the wrong impression.

1022
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.494
How much is a detonator?

1023
00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:40.140
Not much.
(SNIFFS)


1024
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.179
What's not much?

1025
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.491
I don't know, just
not a lot of money.

1026
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.533
What's not a lot of money?

1027
00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.130
I don't know. What do you think?
What's a detonator gonna run?


1028
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.655
- Not much.
- Yeah.


1029
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:52.494
Okay. So you guys don't know
what a detonator costs, do you?


1030
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.060
- No, no...
- You have no idea.


1031
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:57.293
- We know what a detonator costs.
- You have no idea...


1032
00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:59.293
We've been around detonators,
trust us, we know.


1033
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.054
We know exactly how much it costs,
it costs nothing.


1034
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.132
It's not very important. 
You're fixated on this.

1035
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.860
Don't worry, it's nothing.

1036
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:06.455
Where is he supposed to get a detonator?

1037
00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.572
I know a guy.

1038
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:12.291
ROLLY: That Haney's such a jerk.
You should see how he treats his wife.


1039
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:14.577
Does he ever see you around the house?

1040
00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:17.138
Yeah. Yeah. He thinks I'm the heating guy.

1041
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:18.974
He doesn't have any idea who you are?

1042
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.336
Wait.

1043
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.341
- Is this him?
- There he is.


1044
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:28.570
ROLLY: My God, he's got a Howard?

1045
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.732
FRANK: Oh, he went with the orange one.

1046
00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.380
Should I get out?

1047
00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:47.940
I'm Rolly.

1048
00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.854
(WITH ACCENT) I'm Tibor.

1049
00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:51.614
Nice to meet you.

1050
00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:53.934
You want detonator?

1051
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:56.010
What's that accent?

1052
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:57.780
I'm from Chechnya.

1053
00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:01.013
- Ah, Chechnya.
- You have been to Chechnya?


1054
00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:02.694
Tibor, I haven't been to Chechnya,

1055
00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:05.501
and may I be perfectly honest,
I mean no disrespect,


1056
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.221
I never had any desire to go.

1057
00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.460
- You bring money?
- How much is a detonator?


1058
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.493
$1,000.

1059
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.780
Really? $1,000 seems a tad pricey.

1060
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:20.540
You have bought detonator before?

1061
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.897
- No.
- So how do you know price of detonator?


1062
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:27.214
It's like if you go on <i>The Price Is Right</i>
and they bring out a television.


1063
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.418
You have to guess what this thing cost.

1064
00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.572
Some people are off by thousands of dollars.

1065
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.812
You guess 1,000 and it's 6,000.

1066
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.619
If I'm on <i>The Price is Right,</i>

1067
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:40.093
and they bring out the detonator,
I'm saying $600,


1068
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.821
- $500...
- Shut the fuck up!


1069
00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:45.813
All right. Okay.

1070
00:51:50.170 --> 00:51:51.854
You know, when you get older,

1071
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.058
it's not so easy
to go through the bills anymore.


1072
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.940
That's why you see old people,
you know, they always go like this.


1073
00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:58.819
I'm starting to go like this now.

1074
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.531
This all the time, you know, like Fagin.

1075
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:02.691
I'm doing this.

1076
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:05.340
There you go.

1077
00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:09.015
This is detonator.

1078
00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:11.616
- Okay, this is it, huh?
- Good luck.


1079
00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.500
COMPUTERIZED VOICE: <i>Hi, Tibor.</i>

1080
00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:25.535
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?


1081
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.731
What the fuck? 
What the fuck?

1082
00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.858
You waved me to go
and then you hit me.

1083
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.621
No. No, I didn't wave you to go.
I waved goodbye.


1084
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:39.771
That's goodbye.

1085
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.540
It was not goodbye. 
It was not this.

1086
00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.453
It was like this,
like go. You said go.

1087
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.498
- No, I didn't say go.
- I went and you hit me.


1088
00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:48.460
No, Tibor, I did not say go! 
I said goodbye.

1089
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.295
Go, if I said go, 
I would have gone go, go, go.

1090
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.816
This is goodbye.
How do you misinterpret that?


1091
00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:55.972
Why would you wave goodbye to me?

1092
00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.256
I don't fucking know you.

1093
00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:58.934
What do you mean
why would I wave goodbye?


1094
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:02.412
It's polite. We had an encounter, we talked.

1095
00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:05.812
I will get estimate, okay, for Howard.

1096
00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:10.018
I will find you and you will pay.

1097
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:15.820
Hey, Rolly.

1098
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:17.858
Hey. You wanted to see me?

1099
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:19.301
Yeah.

1100
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:24.331
It was a little chilly last night,
and I just wanted to know how it's going.


1101
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.937
Well, first of all, I'm really sorry about that,
but I gotta tell you something.


1102
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:29.250
I'm working overtime on this thing.

1103
00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:30.491
I'm sure.

1104
00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.176
The problem is the, um,

1105
00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:36.777
ecto-plexmatic tubes
are not connected properly.

Come with me, because it's...

1109
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:47.420
I left my hammer in the gym,

1110
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.254
and I'll explain the whole thing to you.

1111
00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:50.695
But you've got a hammer on your belt.

1112
00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:52.454
No, my lucky hammer.

1113
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.100
Can I ask you a question?

1114
00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:58.855
Do you know anything
about this fair on Saturday?


1115
00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:00.580
Oh! Are you kidding?

1116
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:02.254
- The fair, of course.
- Yeah?


1117
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:05.015
They have it once a year,
and everybody on the island goes.


1118
00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:06.819
It's fun. You know, there's rides

1119
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:08.858
and there's a dunking booth,
you ever see one of those?


1120
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:10.261
I love the dunking booth.

1121
00:54:10.330 --> 00:54:12.571
The dunking booth,
and they got, like, Best Pig.


1122
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:14.977
- Okay.
- And Best Danish.

My husband's leaving this weekend.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:25.180
I think that's what I'm gonna do.

1128
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.015
I'm gonna go to the fair on Saturday.
I'm gonna do it.

at the fair all day Saturday.

the place on Saturday then.

Okay, see you.

- I'm gonna follow her from the gate...
- JOE: Right.

...over to the fair.

1147
00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.097
If I see that she's heading back,
I'm gonna text you.

That should give you plenty
of time to get out.

(SIGHS)

1152
00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:22.821
See, they should have pee flaps in cars.

1153
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:26.178
Pee flaps. A little flap, a cylindrical tube.

1154
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:28.332
You pee right into the tube.

1155
00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:29.650
Wouldn't that be a great idea?

1156
00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:33.131
- Where does it go?
- Yeah, where would it go?


1157
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.577
- Can't just let it out.
- Yeah. The same set-up as an airplane.


1158
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:37.818
I don't think you thought this through.
I'm just gonna be honest.

There'll be piss all over the roads.

1160

No. That one astronaut tried
to kill that other astronaut

- and she drove cross-country in a diaper.
- Oh, yeah.

That's a good idea, a car diaper.

1164
00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:51.855
You do a car diaper,
that makes more sense than a pee flap.


1165
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:54.501
A car diaper? That's the worst idea ever.

1166
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:55.651
You sell them at gas stations...

Well, well, well. 
What a surprise, Rolly.

Hey. Fancy meeting you here.

1172
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:29.176
- Meeting you, yeah.
- Yeah.


1173
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:31.617
You know that swing set
I asked you to put together?


1174
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:32.930
- Yeah.
- It collapsed.


1175
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:34.580
I know. I know all about that.

1176
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:36.971
Yeah. Did you know there
were a lot of kids on it?


1177
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:39.496
Did you know two of them
are in the hospital right now?


1178
00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:41.572
I followed all the instructions.

1179
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.095
You're fired.

1180
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.298
- What?
- That's right, you're fired.


1181
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:47.259
Turn in your helmet.

McKenzie, it's gonna be you.

1184
00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.579
and done wonders on your shoddy work.

1185

"Ecto" what? I'm sorry...

1186
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.261
The flagellator...
We can't even find the flagellator.


1187
00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:03.732
- The "flaga" what?
- And the exo-plagmatic tube.


1188
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:07.053
The heat has not been working
since I arrived in this house, McKenzie.


1189
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:08.655
I will take care of it.

1190
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.220
If you're gonna fire anybody,

1191
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:12.452
you're gonna come to me first
and you're gonna ask me.


1192
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.897
- I'll take care of everything.
- Well, you better get on it.


1193
00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.450
- That's why I hired you.
- Nice to see you, Mrs. Haney.


1194
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:18.941
Yeah, nice to see you too.

1195
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:20.500
- Enjoy the fair.
- RHONDA: I'm sorry.


1196
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.937
I'm so sorry about that, Rolly.

1197
00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:25.497
Blaming me for the swings?

1198
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.732
Those poor kids. 
I felt so horrible.

1199
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:29.619
I feel so much guilt about that.

1200
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:31.658
I'm gonna visit those kids
in the hospital tomorrow.


1201
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:33.175
- You are?
- I am.


1202
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:34.979
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.


1203
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.337
By the way, this is very fortuitous...

1204
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:38.411

and Martha is his grandmother,
maybe his daughter.

That she wants her space.

No, no. She's saying she wants her space.

be near a black void?

Enjoy the fair, Rolly.

1357
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.858
So what is this Cuban coffee?

1358
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:52.936
ROLLY: Oh, look at this.

1359
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:54.455
RHONDA: It's funny, isn't it?

1360
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.020
What a great picture.

1361
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:58.740
So I'm gonna head home.

1362
01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.097
What? No. You can't do that.

1363
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.855
- Really?
- May I ask a question?


1364
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:05.932
Sure, Rolly.

1365
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:08.456
When was the last time
you were on a Ferris wheel?


1366
01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:10.339
- Really?
- Yes. Here.


1367
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:11.821
- All right. All right.
- Come on.


1368
01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:15.372
Ferris wheel and there's piglets to see, too.

1369
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:17.339
- There are piglets?
- There's little piglets.


1370
01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:18.377
Okay.

1371
01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:20.418
(CHUCKLES) Let's do it.

1372
01:04:23.810 --> 01:04:25.812
JOE: Give me a measurement,
right here, of the duct.


1373
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:29.258
- (PHONE CHIMES)
- Here, hold on. It's from Rolly.


1374
01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:32.018
"I can't hold her much longer!"

1375
01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:35.060
All right. Come on. 
Let's hustle it up.

1376
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:39.731
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

1377
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:43.532
RHONDA: Yes!
ROLLY: Huh?


1378
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:45.419
- Huh? What did I tell you?
- (LAUGHS)


1379
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:47.692
RHONDA: That was so much fun.
ROLLY: That was excellent.


1380
01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:49.898
I haven't done that in so long.

1381
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.211
ROLLY: What? Because of the silverware?

1382
01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.331
(LAUGHS)

1383
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:06.861
- No. That is not...
- But it's neon, it's cute.


1384
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.381
It's not you.
You know what you're lighting up?


1385
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:10.373
- "I'm an asshole."
- (LAUGHS)


1386
01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:13.021
White's a good color. I like white.

1387
01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:15.900
A little fur with those little tie things.

1388
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:17.176
I don't know...

1389
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.617
Hey, you know what? 
Let's get outta here.

1390
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:21.858
Wait, wait. I wanna get a hat.

1391
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:25.975
- I don't think so.
- No? Nothing?


1392
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:27.575
- No.
- Okay. Well...


1393
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:30.733
I'm not a hat person?
He doesn't like me in hats.


1394
01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:33.780
Well, if she really wanted to buy it,
she would have bought it.


1395
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.615
She's blaming it on me.
I had nothing to do with this.


1396
01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:39.375
You know, except for the rides

1397
01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:41.737
and the food, it was actually pretty good.

1398
01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:44.336
- I can't believe the junk you ate.
- Made me so happy.


1399
01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.333
- It's unbelievable.
- (LAUGHS)


1400
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:48.260
How are my teeth?

1401
01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:50.501
Good?

1402
01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:52.254
I think you're okay.

1403
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:54.059
Let me see your teeth, let me see.

1404
01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:56.941
- Hmm. You're good.
- Yeah?


1405
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:59.012
You have a... Hold on... 
A little smudge.

1406
01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.021
There.

1407
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.370
(SIGHS) All right.

1408
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:07.454
This was the best day, excellent.

1409
01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:11.454
So, good night. 
I'll see you at the house.

1410
01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:13.100
- Okay.
- Okay.


1411
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.541
New plan.

1412
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:39.019
Instead of blowing up the house,

1413
01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:41.741
I'm gonna steal Haney's wife,

1414
01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:45.019
marry her and take half his money.

1415
01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:47.172
- FRANK: You gotta be...
- Oh, fuck that. What!


1416
01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.696
- Is this a joke?
- It's not a joke. No.


1417
01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:51.659
- It's not a joke? It's stupid.
- No.


1418
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:54.051
You think she's gonna leave
her young, handsome,


1419
01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:56.098
- billionaire husband...
- Oh, yes.


1420
01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:57.774
...for a broke, bald old dude?

1421
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:01.093
I know when I have a connection
with somebody, okay?


1422
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.979
This woman likes me.

1423
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.176
Really?

1424
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.298
Oh, it's there. It's there.

1425
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:12.213
I love you so much.

1426
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:16.132
I have to tell you something.

1427
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:19.301
I spoke to the doctor,

1428
01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:26.099
and I've decided to stop the treatments.

1429
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:27.615
(CRYING) Oh, no.

1430
01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:29.296
No, no, no.

1431
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:31.259
No! No!

1432
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:33.740
I took her to the fair yesterday.

1433
01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:35.414
She asked me for a tooth check.

1434
01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:37.174
A tooth check, come on.

1435
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:39.059
- It means nothing.
- Who the fuck cares? That means nothing.


1436
01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.370
Rags will give me a tooth check.

1437
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:41.690
All the time.

1438
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.613
- Right...
- You guys do tooth checks?


1439
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:44.976
- Sure.
- RAGS: Constantly.


1440
01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:47.052
I might have kale in there or something.

1441
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.172
She wiped some smudge off my cheek

1442
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:50.411
when I said goodbye to her.

1443
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:51.935
It was probably annoying her.

1444
01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:53.176
ROLLY: No!

1445
01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:54.536
Yeah. She's like, "Get
that shit off your face."

1446
01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:56.692
What about our plan? 
What about me?

1447
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.376
Where does that leave me?
Where does that leave the fellas?


1448
01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:02.260
That's a very legitimate question, Stumpo.

1449
01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:04.856
Once I marry her
and get half her money,

1450
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:08.013
it's gonna leave you
with a million fucking dollars


1451
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:09.694
for each of you!

1452
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:10.931
(SHOUTING AND LAUGHING)

1453
01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:13.900
And after I move in,
we invite everybody on the island


1454
01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:16.337
to come watch us blow up the house.

1455
01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:18.179
- We blow up the house?
- We blow up the house!


1456
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.856
And it's all legal. I own it.

1457
01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:23.335
(LAUGHING)

1458
01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:26.252
How's my plan now?

1459
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.779
You're so brave.

1460
01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:36.059
I just hope the house is ready in time
for the first busload of kids


1461
01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:38.053
that are going through.

1462
01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:39.336
(SIGHS)

1463
01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:44.371
- This is for them.
- Yeah.


1464
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:47.181
They should have a beautiful place to come

1465
01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:50.140
with their family to fight off this

1466
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.380
terrible disease.

1467
01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:54.259
(SIGHS) I love you so much.

1468
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.900
I love you.

1469
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.420
Good morning.

1470
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:24.141
- Rolly.
- Hey, Rhonda!


1471
01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:26.372
Good morning, Ray.

1472
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:29.011
- How you doing?
- RHONDA: Good morning.


1473
01:09:30.570 --> 01:09:32.174
Got a little surprise for you.

1474
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:35.134
They call it vanilla latte.

1475
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:36.416
You're the best.

1476
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:39.500
I observed you the other day,
I saw what you ordered.


1477
01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:41.015
I took a little note, you know.

1478
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:42.376
And you in the seersucker.

1479
01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.418
- What do you think?
- Wow.


1480
01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:46.299
I mean, it takes a
lot to pull that off.

1481
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:48.532
What? Are you kidding?
I was raised on seersucker.


1482
01:09:48.610 --> 01:09:49.975
Got bar mitzvahed in seersucker.

1483
01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:51.461
I got a closet full of these.

1484
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:52.861
- Well...
- It's all I wear.


1485
01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:55.410
- You wanna come inside?
- Love to.


1486
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:58.015
- Hey, asshole.
- WORKER: What?


1487
01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:59.421
What the hell are you looking at?

1488
01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:00.651
- Get the fuck over here.
- WORKER: Yes, sir.


1489
01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:03.051
Throw those bags in... God damn it!

1490
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:06.612
You know what?
That lid, that sippy lid with the hole in it.


1491
01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:07.976
- Yeah?
- I invented that.


1492
01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:09.620
Really? You know what else you invented?

1493
01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:11.175
What?

1494
01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:15.014
- Oh, my God.
- They look so great. I really love them.


1495
01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:17.536
I hope it really catches on.
I gotta tell you something.


1496
01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:19.294
Because I would love to be remembered

1497
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:21.941
as the guy who invented the eye-level outlet.

1498
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:23.296
What a legacy that would be.

1499
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:24.741
Yeah. It would be amazing.

1500
01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.972
And then you could get into
designing the plates...


1501
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:28.017
- Hey.
- Hey.


1502
01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.421
You have coffee. 
You need coffee?

1503
01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:30.537
Oh, no thanks.

1504
01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:32.260
Yeah. Rolly got me a vanilla latte.

1505
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:33.616
She likes lattes.

1506
01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:35.055
Look at the jacket.

1507
01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.650
- Yeah, it's seersucker.
- Yeah. Sharp.


1508
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:39.220
I never could get my head around seersucker.

1509
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:41.531
Really? It's a nice look.

Let's go water-skiing.
We gotta take out the new boat.


1513

I'm happy to take you water-skiing.


1515

You want me to...

1516

My friend Frank can drive the boat.

1517

Take it out. It's there to be enjoyed.

- Howard, this is Rolly.
- Rolly.


1524

He's helping us out around
the house a little bit.

- Hello, Howard.
- Run upstairs, grab a shower,


1526
01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:15.860
- we'll go get something to eat.
- All right. Sounds good.

Man, oh, man. What charisma.

1533
01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.652
He lights up a room, this kid.

1534
01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:33.976
- He does.
- He lights it up.

- Can I say something crazy?
- Yeah.


1536
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:37.091
I think this kid could be president.

1537
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:39.696
I'm not kidding. 
He's got that aura.

1538
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:41.101
Or at least a senator.

1539
01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:43.696
- The girls are all over him.
- A councilman, a city council.


1540
01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:46.091
- A councilman?
- That kid could be in the city council.

You're very sweet, thank you so much.

1542

FRANK: I fucking doubted you,
but you were right.

I know I made
fun of the bowling alley.

To tell you the truth,
between you and me, I love to bowl.

I've checked with my friends

around the country in law enforcement.

Okay. You'll take a ball.

Yes, a ball.

1604

I see. Very nice of
you not to take two.

1605
01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:16.260
You could be taking two.

This is a testament to your character, Tibor.

1607

You could be taking two balls,
you're only taking one.

1662
01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:17.252
Rolly, I've been driving this road every day.

1663
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.651
Rhonda, I've been here 10 years.

1664
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:21.812
I know every clearance on the island.

1665
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:24.814
You need to back up. 
Why should I back up?

1666
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.301
You got a little tiny car.

1667
01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:28.293
I'm sorry. I can't even believe
we're having this conversation!


1668
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:29.656
I don't believe it either!

1669
01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:31.494
Your clearance is right behind you.

1670
01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:32.901
ROLLY: You want to
bet some money on that?

1671
01:17:32.970 --> 01:17:34.335
RHONDA: Yeah, I wanna bet a lot of money
on that!


1672
01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:35.935
ROLLY: And you have the
money to put on it!

1673
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:38.291
- Move your car. Rolly!
- What?


1674
01:17:38.370 --> 01:17:40.498
- Back up your car.
- No, back up your car.


1675
01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:43.016
Oh, my God. Are
you out of your mind?

1676
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:45.218
- I'm out of my mind? What?
- Are you kidding me?


1677
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.621
RHONDA: It's not that hard!

1678
01:17:46.690 --> 01:17:48.977
- It's not that hard to do!
- You don't know about Vineyard etiquette.


1679
01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:51.530
Vineyard etiquette dictates
that the person closest to the clearance...


1680
01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:53.140
- Vineyard etiquette?
- ...moves back.


1681
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:55.816
- No, you back up your car.
- What, you have a Howard,


1682
01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:57.813
you're entitled to do
anything you want, is that it?


1683
01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:01.019
I didn't say that my Howard entitled me
to not move backwards.


1684
01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:03.297
- Back up your car.
- No, you back up your car.


1685
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:06.300
- No, you back up.
- No, you back up.


1686
01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:12.411
(GRUNTING)

1687
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:15.090
(SPITS AND SPUTTERS)

1688
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.094
Are you crazy?

1689
01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:22.140
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1690
01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.336
No good?

1691
01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:25.617
Crazy old man!

1692
01:18:25.690 --> 01:18:29.581
I love my husband. "No good, " Rolly.

1693
01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:32.019
I thought there was a little...

1694
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:35.412
Yeah. Get in your car and back the fuck up!
Back up!


1695
01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:39.140
The smudge... You gave me a smudge thing.

1696
01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:41.133
A smudge?

1697
01:18:41.210 --> 01:18:43.656
Yeah. A tooth check.

1698
01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:46.620
- Get in your car!
- I'll get in the car.


1699
01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:48.055
- A smudge?
- Sorry.


1700
01:18:48.130 --> 01:18:50.098
What are you, in fucking middle school?

1701
01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:52.093
A misunderstanding.

1702
01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:01.413
I don't know what I was thinking.
I don't know.


1703
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:03.697
No, you placed too much emphasis
on a tooth check,


1704
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:05.056
I can tell you that right now.

1705
01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:07.656
Tooth checks don't mean
what they used to mean, you know.


1706
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:10.051
So what now, what do we do now?

1707
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:11.541
Back to Plan A.

1708
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:13.533
This is exactly what we should
have done in the first place.


1709
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.772
Now we're right back, full circle, it's on.

1710
01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:19.616
Am I right? Come on.
Let's go blow that fucking house up.


1711
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:21.980
Am I right?

1712
01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:26.415
Okay.

1713
01:19:26.490 --> 01:19:29.619
Good news. Hot dog! 
What's the plan?

1714
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:32.332
Well, next week's the Chicago concert.

1715
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:34.412
I know the Haneys are going,
nobody's gonna be home.


1716
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:37.414
All right.
The day of the Chicago concert, that's it.


1717
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:40.172
This is great. 
This is great.

1718
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:42.537
- Do me a favor, will you?
- Sure.


1719
01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:45.099
There's a painting of mine in that house.

1720
01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:46.410
- Okay.
- It's a Plepler.


1721
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:48.492
He stole it from me.

1722
01:19:49.210 --> 01:19:51.099
It's a painting of a shopping cart.

1723
01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.452
- It's a painting of a shopping cart...
- Shopping cart.


1724
01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:56.101
Is a Plepler a type of shopping cart
or is that who painted it?


1725
01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:57.456
JOE: What is the matter with you?

1726
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:59.976
We're in. The day of the Chicago concert,

1727
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:02.212
all hands in.

1728
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:03.891
Hands in.

1729
01:20:03.970 --> 01:20:06.098
I'm not involved, 
I'm just a liaison.

1730
01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:09.253
Come on, fellas. Put our hands in.
Go on in there.


1731
01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:11.134
Put your hand in there. Nice work.

1732
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:16.293
I'm gonna fix that bald-headed motherfucker.

1733
01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.454
Wait until you hear this bullshit.

1734
01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:37.974
Hey, you better hold on to these.

1735
01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:39.461
I plan on getting fucked up.

1736
01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:41.294
All right. I'm gonna meet you
in the lobby in a few minutes.


1737
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:44.579
- I gotta do something.
- Whoo! Fucking Chicago!


1738
01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:46.654
- Do you have a pass?
- No.


1739
01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:48.778
I can't let you in
without a pass, my man.

1740
01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:50.739
I'm gonna level with you, okay?

1741
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:52.858
- Okay, level with me.
- Here's what happened.


1742
01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:55.137
My ex-girlfriend,
who I lived with for three years,


1743
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:58.379
I found out now that
it's possible that she had

1744
01:20:58.450 --> 01:21:01.977
some kind of oral activity
with them 20 years ago


1745
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.501
after they played here.

1746
01:21:03.570 --> 01:21:05.572
So it's kind of... 
It's bugging me

1747
01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:08.460
and I need... I just want
to find out if it's true.

1748
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:10.379
I understand you might wanna know,

1749
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:13.215
but I just can't let you back here
without a pass.


1750
01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:14.780
Okay. Yeah, you did a good job.

1751
01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.852
- You're doing your job.
- That's what it is.


1752
01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:19.774
Where do they want us for this photo shoot?
Excuse me...


1753
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:22.137
ROLLY: I'm not a nut.
I just have one quick question.


1754
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.531
- I'm sorry. One question.
- Yeah. Sure.


1755
01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:28.535
When you guys were here 20 years ago,

1756
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:31.420
do you remember getting blown
by a woman named Wendy?


1757
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:33.413
- (ALL LAUGHING)
- What?


1758
01:21:33.490 --> 01:21:35.538
- You're serious?
- Sorry to be so blunt.


1759
01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:36.975
Twenty years ago?

1760
01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:38.654
And this is what she looked like.

1761
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:41.051
- That's a long time.
- Yeah. I do remember her.


1762
01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:42.740
- I don't know.
- You do? Really?


1763
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:44.016
- Yes.
- I don't know.


1764
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:47.532
Yeah, that was me. Yes. 
I remember her.

1765
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:49.021
She was a lot of fun, wasn't she?

1766
01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:50.740
- Yeah, she was.
- I think that was you.


1767
01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:52.494
- You and you?
- Yeah.


1768
01:21:52.570 --> 01:21:54.379
- Two?
- Definitely. Yeah.


1769
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:55.690
Wendy.

1770
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:58.530
Okay.

1771
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:59.896
I was with another chick.

1772
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:01.415
Roberta Stumpo?

1773
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:03.492
- Yeah.
- Roberta Stumpo.


1774
01:22:03.610 --> 01:22:06.261
Thanks for clearing that up. 
Appreciate it.

1775
01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:07.900
- Whatever.
- Roberta Stumpo...


1776
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:09.131
Can't believe how good that show was.

1777
01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:30.451
Hey, that's Nathan Flomm!

1778
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:32.658
That's the guy that lost a billion dollars.

1779
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:34.334
That's him.

1780
01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:37.860
Hey, Rolly, what's the deal?
Are all these rumors true?


1781
01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:40.661
Are you Nathan Flomm? 
Just be honest.

1782
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:50.854
- Everybody knows.
- Yeah. I know. Jaspar.


1783
01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:54.455
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- Go home?


1784
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:55.861
I can't stay here, this is horrible.

1785
01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:57.170
No, it's...

1786
01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.615
It's embarrassing. 
I don't wanna be here.

1787
01:22:58.690 --> 01:23:00.613
Who cares if it's embarrassing?
This is your alibi, remember?


1788
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:02.215
Right.

1789
01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:05.851
How dare you, Nathan Flomm,
come to the Chicago concert!


1790
01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:08.891
That's good.

1791
01:23:08.970 --> 01:23:12.099
How dare you!
Get the fuck out of here, Nathan Flomm!


1792
01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:14.491
- MAN 1: That's him, Flomm.
- Jerk.


1793
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:15.617
MAN 2: That billion-dollar guy?

1794
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:24.056
I would like to speak with please,

1795
01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:27.976
Mr. Robert Lamm
or members of Chicago band.


1796
01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:29.700
Do you have a pass?

1797
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:31.135
I have problem.

1798
01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:35.056
My friend, they say she has had

1799
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:39.258
oral intimacies with the... 
With the band.

1800
01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:42.340
And I want to know
for me is this true.

1801
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:43.935
Is her name Wendy?

1802
01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:45.899
- No.
- Roberta?


1803
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:48.252
No. Her name is Jennifer.

1804
01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.778
Jennifer? All right. 
I'll be right back.

1805
01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:02.859
You got a tissue?

1806
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:04.694
Why would I carry a tissue around?

1807
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:07.011
Why wouldn't you have a tissue?
It's not inconceivable.


1808
01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:10.333
I would leave my house
and take tissues before I leave,


1809
01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:11.696
just put them in my pocket?

1810
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:13.181

01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:22.540
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.


1963
01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:24.620
On one condition.

1964
01:34:24.690 --> 01:34:26.692
You take a shave.

1965
01:34:27.650 --> 01:34:29.493
- You got a deal.
- Got a deal?


1966
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:30.901
For you.

1967
01:34:33.490 --> 01:34:35.015
I can't wait.

1968
01:34:35.490 --> 01:34:36.730
Me either.

1969
01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:39.251
(LOUD LAUGHTER)

1970
01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:40.735
FRANK: Unbelievable!

1971
01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:42.619
Is your cousin Stinky still working on cars?

1972
01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:44.101
- Nah, he sucks.
- MIKE: Oh, man.


1973
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:45.695
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1974
01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:47.977
ROLLY: All right.
Come on, let's play some cards.


1975
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:49.939
(CHEERING)

1976
01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:54.774
- Wow!
- All right.


1977
01:34:54.850 --> 01:34:58.138
- This is awesome, man.
- Good to see you, brother.


1978
01:34:58.210 --> 01:35:00.372
- Good to see you.
- Pull up a chair.


1979
01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:03.499
Oh, look. I got my old spot back.

1980
01:35:03.570 --> 01:35:04.810
You got all cleaned up.

1981
01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:07.171
I was prepping these dudes
for the homeless wizard look.


1982
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.490
Yeah. I got a
little shave and a haircut.

1983
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:10.493
I didn't want to scare anybody, you know.

1984
01:35:10.570 --> 01:35:13.938
Hey, what do we call you?
Rolly? Nathan? What...


1985
01:35:14.010 --> 01:35:15.455
Rolly.

1986
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:17.259
- Rolly it is.
- ROLLY: Yeah. Rolly.


1987
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:19.332
- MIKE: Welcome home.
- Thank you very much.


1988
01:35:19.410 --> 01:35:22.254
So, Rolly, am I the first woman you've seen
since you've been out?


1989
01:35:22.330 --> 01:35:23.820
Dottie, you're the first.

1990
01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:25.176
You and me, come on,
let's go. Let's do it.

1991
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:27.378
You're the first, Dottie.

1992
01:35:27.450 --> 01:35:28.611
(ALL LAUGHING)

1993
01:35:28.690 --> 01:35:30.101
ROLLY: What's the game?

1994
01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:32.537
Five-card draw.
I think that's your favorite, isn't it?


1995
01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:35.534
Same shit-game that he always plays,
nothing's changed.


1996
01:35:35.610 --> 01:35:36.691
(ALL LAUGHING)

1997
01:35:36.770 --> 01:35:38.260
MAN: Ante up, you guys.

1998
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:41.334
Well, whether you know it or not, Rolly,

1999
01:35:41.410 --> 01:35:44.334
you have become a bit
of a hero in these parts.


2000
01:35:44.410 --> 01:35:49.211
A lot of people were happy to see
that monstrosity of a house hit the dust.


2001
01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:50.530
- Local hero.
- You're the guy.


2002
01:35:50.610 --> 01:35:52.374
Ballsy move.

2003
01:35:52.450 --> 01:35:55.215
Your three years in prison
was worth getting rid of that house.


2004
01:35:55.290 --> 01:35:57.861
- Absolutely.
- Hey, what happened to Money Bags?


2005
01:35:57.930 --> 01:35:59.500
They got him on some treatment.
He's in remission.


2006
01:35:59.610 --> 01:36:01.214
- They went back to California.
- ROLLY: No kidding?


2007
01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:02.940
Are they ever coming back to the island?

2008
01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:06.696
I don't think they should,
knowing that Rolly's back in town.


2009
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:09.774
- Oh, yeah. What am I thinking?
- That wouldn't be the smartest thing for them.


2010
01:36:09.850 --> 01:36:11.215
All right, ante in.

2011
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:15.574
My only regret, Rolly, is that you missed
the Chicago concert that night.


2012
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:18.176
My God! Best show I've ever seen.

2013
01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.740
The entire island was there.

2014
01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:21.414
- They were great.
- Yeah. All three encores.


2015
01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:23.492
Everybody had a great time,
especially the band.


2016
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:24.901
ROLLY: Why is that?

2017
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:26.660
Jennifer blew them in the parking lot.

2018
01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:29.256
- I forgot about that.
- Jennifer? The whole band?


2019
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:32.174
- Lee Loughnane, for sure.
- MIKE: Definitely Jimmy Pankow.


2020
01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:34.935
FRANK: No. No. Not Pankow.
It was Loughnane and Robert Lamm.


2021
01:36:35.010 --> 01:36:37.741
- DOTTIE: No. It was all three.
