1
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.420
SWITCHBACK

2
00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:58.779
Whoo, there.

3
00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:00.790
Your folks are gonna
be home soon,


4
00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:03.486
and they're gonna get me if
they see you're still up.


5
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.119
Ooh, hold still, hold still.

6
00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:06.629
We got to dry you off.

7
00:01:06.697 --> 00:01:07.664
There you go.

8
00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:13.529
Let me get your head in there.

9
00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:16.095
Oh. Is somebody at the door?

10
00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:17.141
I don't care.

11
00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:18.869
Who can it be?

12
00:01:24.382 --> 00:01:25.974
Now, you play with your train.

13
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.574
I'll be right back, ok?

14
00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:28.584
Yeah. Hurry back.

15
00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:29.585
All right.

16
00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:41.826
Evening, ma'am.

17
00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.491
Is Frank or Jean home?

18
00:01:43.568 --> 00:01:46.662
No, they're not. They'll
be back real soon.


19
00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:48.329
You must be Missy.

20
00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:50.874
Forgive me for not
introducing myself, Missy.


21
00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:54.469
I'm Tom Bellingham, an old
friend of Jean's from Denver.


22
00:01:54.545 --> 00:01:56.740
I told her last week I'd
stop in and say hello.


23
00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:59.578
When did you say they'd be back?

24
00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:07.891
Maybe 30 minutes.

25
00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.053
Darn. I'm gonna miss them.

26
00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:13.062
My plane leaves in an hour.

27
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.064
Would you tell them
that I just dropped by


28
00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:16.861
to steal a peek at little Andy?

29
00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:19.835
My wife would kill me if I
came all the way from Denver


30
00:02:19.904 --> 00:02:21.599
and didn't say hello.

31
00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:24.869
I'm sorry, Mr. Bellingham.
They'll be home real soon.


32
00:02:24.942 --> 00:02:26.534
I understand.

33
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:29.307
Don't you worry.

34
00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:02.803
Andy?

35
00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.404
"Jack McGinnis for sheriff.

36
00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:23.708
It is time for a change."

37
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.011
My God, that boy can smile.

38
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:35.651
Morning, sheriff.

39
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.231
Coroner's been on scene
about 20, 25 minutes.


40
00:06:47.304 --> 00:06:49.033
Is the sheriff there yet?

41
00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:51.266
That's a 10-4. The
sheriff's here now.


42
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:54.606
All right. I'll release
a couple of units then.


43
00:06:54.678 --> 00:06:56.578
Coming on the election eve,

44
00:06:56.646 --> 00:06:58.011
Amarillo residents
will certainly..


45
00:06:58.081 --> 00:06:59.013
Morning, boys.

46
00:06:59.082 --> 00:07:00.014
Morning, sheriff.

47
00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:01.414
Morning, sir.

48
00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:02.883
Thanks, Charlie.

49
00:07:07.858 --> 00:07:09.223
Hey, sheriff.

50
00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:10.657
Hey, Bud. How's your daddy?

51
00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:14.026
He's doing better. I'll
tell him you asked.


52
00:07:14.097 --> 00:07:15.792
Tell him to stay off that leg.

53
00:07:15.866 --> 00:07:16.798
Hey.

54
00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:17.799
Sheriff.

55
00:07:17.868 --> 00:07:18.892
Buck.

56
00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:20.732
Sim.

57
00:07:20.804 --> 00:07:23.068
You want to tell me about it?

58
00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:24.470
Aw, ain't so bad.

59
00:07:26.943 --> 00:07:30.709
Male had a severed femoral
artery in the groin area.


60
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.304
Female had her throat cut.

61
00:07:32.382 --> 00:07:35.283
Both wounds, single incisions,
almost surgical cuts.


62
00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:37.445
Whoever done this knew
what they were doing.


63
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.919
Nothing tentative about it.

64
00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:41.753
I can give you more when
we get them out of here.


65
00:07:44.494 --> 00:07:46.860
How are you holding up?

66
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.263
When have you ever known me
to worry about an election?


67
00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:53.666
Never. Then again, I've never known
anybody who could beat you before.


68
00:07:53.737 --> 00:07:55.898
You still don't.

69
00:07:57.173 --> 00:08:00.336
Nate. Tell me about it.

70
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.641
This fella registered as,
uh, Bill Sutherland.


71
00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:07.205
Home, Fort Worth. Checked
in alone, but paid for 2.


72
00:08:07.284 --> 00:08:11.152
The owner said that he paid from a thick
wad of bills like to choke a horse.


73
00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:14.190
Now, we have no money,
have no wallet.


74
00:08:14.257 --> 00:08:17.488
Keys, car are gone. We're gonna get an I.D.
on the car any minute.


75
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.858
What about the girl?

76
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.263
She was a maid
here at the motel.


77
00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:25.927
It's a family place.

78
00:08:26.002 --> 00:08:28.061
Here it is..

79
00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:30.072
Now, he's in the bathroom.

80
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.539
He's finished with Sutherland.

81
00:08:31.608 --> 00:08:33.405
She knocks on the door.

82
00:08:33.476 --> 00:08:34.568
There's no answer.

83
00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:36.043
She comes in.

84
00:08:36.112 --> 00:08:38.478
He grabs her, cuts her,

85
00:08:38.548 --> 00:08:40.516
stops the blood with the towel,

86
00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:43.484
and then carries her
into the bathroom.


87
00:08:43.553 --> 00:08:45.544
Why?

88
00:08:45.622 --> 00:08:47.783
Go figure.

89
00:08:53.396 --> 00:08:54.988
What about the other guy?

90
00:08:55.065 --> 00:08:57.693
No, no one saw another person.

91
00:08:57.767 --> 00:08:59.428
Both beds have been slept in.

92
00:08:59.502 --> 00:09:02.062
We found hair samples in this
bed matches Sutherland's.


93
00:09:02.138 --> 00:09:05.369
Now, this bed's been slept
in, but it's clean.


94
00:09:05.442 --> 00:09:06.409
Clean?

95
00:09:06.476 --> 00:09:08.307
Is that a fact?

96
00:09:12.682 --> 00:09:14.547
We will check it again.

97
00:09:19.756 --> 00:09:23.453
We're pulling the 4 hours surrounding
the time of the murders.


98
00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:35.303
Buck, we don't know if
he even came in here..


99
00:09:35.372 --> 00:09:38.205
or who we're looking for.

100
00:09:38.274 --> 00:09:41.732
Soon as you can, Nate,
bring in the waitresses.


101
00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:44.939
Find out who they know..

102
00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:46.607
Regular customers first,

103
00:09:46.683 --> 00:09:48.583
then work back from there.

104
00:09:50.653 --> 00:09:51.642
Your sister gonna vote for me?

105
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:54.189
Well, she sure likes
your billboards.


106
00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:58.526
Aw, jeez. McGinnis.

107
00:10:01.364 --> 00:10:03.457
Hey, Jack, how you doin'?

108
00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:05.558
Looks like a bad one, Buck.

109
00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:07.728
Thought I'd come by to see
if you needed any help.


110
00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:09.738
Well, that's mighty nice
of you to offer, Jack.


111
00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:14.300
Maybe you and your boys can
handle traffic out on the street.


112
00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:18.579
A lot of people are gonna
be concerned about this one


113
00:10:18.648 --> 00:10:20.081
when they hear about it, Buck.

114
00:10:21.851 --> 00:10:25.480
If this killer turns
up in my jurisdiction,


115
00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:28.149
don't expect a courtesy call.

116
00:10:28.224 --> 00:10:30.192
If he's in your
jurisdiction, Jack,


117
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.127
he's safe as a church-mouse.

118
00:10:36.966 --> 00:10:39.332
So what about this missing car?

119
00:10:39.402 --> 00:10:42.769
1996 Ford Explorer,
red, Texas plates.


120
00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:45.239
State Patrol's got
the word out on it.


121
00:10:45.308 --> 00:10:46.502
Find it.

122
00:10:50.947 --> 00:10:53.973
Comin' up on our turnoff.

123
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.884
Sure you won't come
up, stay the night?


124
00:10:57.954 --> 00:11:02.482
Thanks. Uh, I need to get a little
further up the road before dark.


125
00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:06.655
Well, just don't get stuck
out here if this storm hits.


126
00:12:25.575 --> 00:12:27.202
Thanks for stopping.

127
00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:30.680
There's a girl with a heart

128
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.614
There's a girl with a heart

129
00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:35.014
As big as the sky

130
00:12:35.084 --> 00:12:36.517
Well, get in, boy.

131
00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:39.520
I can't heat this car and the
whole New Mexico desert, too.


132
00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:49.892
All for the love of sunshine

133
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:56.233
All for the love of sunshine

134
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.579
Always drive with my doors
locked, seat belts on.


135
00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:07.616
Habit.

136
00:13:07.683 --> 00:13:09.583
I'm a creature of habit.

137
00:13:14.757 --> 00:13:16.691
Some collection, eh?

138
00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:18.727
Yeah.

139
00:13:18.794 --> 00:13:21.729
You should have
seen my first one.


140
00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:23.094
'82 Seville.

141
00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:25.690
Had my girls all lacquered
on with liquid sealer.


142
00:13:25.768 --> 00:13:27.326
Man, it was a beaut.

143
00:13:27.403 --> 00:13:29.997
But after a while, you
know, your tastes change,


144
00:13:30.072 --> 00:13:33.235
you get tired of looking at
the same old faces and all.


145
00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:37.541
When I ran out of room to put
up new ones, I had to sell her.


146
00:13:37.613 --> 00:13:41.674
Man, I had a heck of a time
trying to get rid of her.


147
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:43.048
I bet.

148
00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:44.711
This honey here,

149
00:13:44.787 --> 00:13:47.381
this baby's the
state of the art.


150
00:13:47.456 --> 00:13:50.084
Now if get tired of
one of my sugars,


151
00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:53.128
I just slip her out..

152
00:13:56.198 --> 00:13:59.497
toss her.. and put
me up a new one.


153
00:14:05.808 --> 00:14:09.039
Don't worry, Trudy, honey.

154
00:14:09.111 --> 00:14:11.875
I wasn't going to
throw you away..yet.


155
00:14:13.983 --> 00:14:17.510
Yeah.. hell of a lot cheaper
than buying a new car.


156
00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:18.644
Yeah.

157
00:14:18.721 --> 00:14:22.782
I'm pulling your leg.
Ain't my car.


158
00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:25.486
It's a friend's. I'm just
returning it to him.


159
00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:28.223
Had you going, didn't I?

160
00:14:28.297 --> 00:14:32.256
Name's Goodall. Bob Goodall.

161
00:14:32.334 --> 00:14:34.234
Lane Dixon.

162
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.132
Where you heading, Lane?

163
00:14:37.206 --> 00:14:38.400
Utah.

164
00:14:38.474 --> 00:14:40.965
Big place, Utah.

165
00:14:41.043 --> 00:14:42.305
Salt Lake City.

166
00:14:42.378 --> 00:14:45.108
Me, too. Now, how's
that for luck?


167
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:47.308
First I save you from
freezing to death,


168
00:14:47.383 --> 00:14:49.817
now you got a free
ride to Mormon land.


169
00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:51.512
Must be my lucky day.

170
00:14:51.587 --> 00:14:52.679
Must be.

171
00:14:52.755 --> 00:14:54.188
I almost didn't stop.

172
00:14:54.256 --> 00:14:55.518
In the old days,

173
00:14:55.591 --> 00:14:58.185
I'd never think twice
about picking up a rider.


174
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.922
These days, you can't be too
careful who you let in your car.


175
00:15:00.996 --> 00:15:03.692
You know, if you'd just let me out
at this place we're coming up on,


176
00:15:03.766 --> 00:15:04.755
that'd be great.

177
00:15:04.834 --> 00:15:06.961
I don't think so.
There's another place


178
00:15:07.036 --> 00:15:08.765
about 20 miles up the road.

179
00:15:08.838 --> 00:15:10.328
Look, I said I want out here.

180
00:15:10.406 --> 00:15:12.772
Sorry, friend. This
is mining country.


181
00:15:12.842 --> 00:15:14.503
I can take care of myself.

182
00:15:14.577 --> 00:15:19.014
I believe you just might
be fool enough to try.


183
00:15:25.855 --> 00:15:27.914
Thanks for the lift.

184
00:15:33.028 --> 00:15:36.987
Hell, lettin' a bunch of naked
women scare you off. Heh heh.


185
00:15:44.306 --> 00:15:46.069
How you doin'?

186
00:15:46.141 --> 00:15:47.403
I'll have a beer.

187
00:15:53.515 --> 00:15:54.709
Don't have beer.

188
00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:01.420
Ok, uh..

189
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.084
I'll have whatever's in
one of those bottles.


190
00:16:08.097 --> 00:16:11.999
I was hoping I might catch
a ride over to Raton.


191
00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:14.035
Well..

192
00:16:14.103 --> 00:16:17.368
you might be waiting
here a long time, then.


193
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:21.676
Well, I'll take a ride
anywhere in that direction.


194
00:16:24.246 --> 00:16:25.713
I bet you would.

195
00:16:30.152 --> 00:16:32.177
You got a problem
with something?


196
00:16:32.254 --> 00:16:34.449
You say this is the guy, Ben?

197
00:16:34.523 --> 00:16:36.753
He's one of them, all right.

198
00:16:36.825 --> 00:16:39.157
My friend Ben here

199
00:16:39.228 --> 00:16:41.719
was in Raton last Friday night.

200
00:16:41.797 --> 00:16:46.860
Claims you and some of
your friends jumped him.


201
00:16:46.936 --> 00:16:49.336
Well, he's mistaken.

202
00:16:49.405 --> 00:16:52.636
And you're a goddamn liar.

203
00:16:55.811 --> 00:16:57.711
Uh-uh.

204
00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.907
They aren't going
in your direction.


205
00:16:59.982 --> 00:17:01.847
Course right now,

206
00:17:01.917 --> 00:17:05.614
I figure you'd probably take
a lift in any direction.


207
00:17:05.688 --> 00:17:09.590
Look, I'm not calling your
friend or anyone else a liar.


208
00:17:09.658 --> 00:17:12.889
All I'm saying is I wouldn't
have done that to anybody.


209
00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.431
On your feet, boy!

210
00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:22.402
You made a bad mistake
comin' in here.


211
00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:28.132
Now, seein' that Ben can't
do this to you himself,


212
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.110
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

213
00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:32.306
Hey, Rick. Do it again.

214
00:17:32.381 --> 00:17:33.575
Come on!

215
00:17:33.649 --> 00:17:34.980
Your memory becoming clearer?

216
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.518
I never saw him before.

217
00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:38.610
No?

218
00:17:46.428 --> 00:17:47.759
Son of a bitch!

219
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.263
Get his goddamn legs.

220
00:17:55.404 --> 00:17:57.031
Want another piece of him?

221
00:17:57.106 --> 00:17:59.404
No, I got to take a leak.

222
00:18:01.577 --> 00:18:02.509
Luke!

223
00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:07.610
You keep him warmed up
till I get back, huh?


224
00:18:07.683 --> 00:18:09.617
Huh?

225
00:18:17.826 --> 00:18:19.555
- Uhh!

226
00:18:19.628 --> 00:18:22.358
Hey, Luke! I said don't
kill the bastard!


227
00:18:22.431 --> 00:18:26.162
I'll be right back! Ha ha ha ha.

228
00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:28.169
Hoo hoo ha ha ha.

229
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.475
Try it, and it's history.

230
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.452
Luke! He's got a knife on me!

231
00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:48.422
Bring the guy in
here, alone, man.


232
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.928
Let him go.

233
00:19:03.005 --> 00:19:06.236
I'll blow your
friend's head off.


234
00:19:06.308 --> 00:19:08.640
Some friends you got.

235
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.443
I didn't come to negotiate, Bud.

236
00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:21.419
Aah! Don't bargain with him,
you asshole! He'll cut my dick off!


237
00:19:27.796 --> 00:19:29.991
Now slide the piece over here.

238
00:19:41.777 --> 00:19:43.267
And let him go.

239
00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:48.674
You ok?

240
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.911
Yeah.

241
00:19:50.986 --> 00:19:52.817
Pick up the gun

242
00:19:52.888 --> 00:19:56.449
and get the keys
out of my pocket.


243
00:19:57.759 --> 00:19:59.624
Pull the car out front,

244
00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:02.186
and when you're ready, honk.

245
00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:04.964
What about you?

246
00:20:06.368 --> 00:20:08.563
I'll be out directly.

247
00:20:16.778 --> 00:20:19.474
Hey.. hey, man, he..
he let the guy go.


248
00:20:19.548 --> 00:20:21.675
W-W-Why don't you
do likewise, huh?


249
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.275
I mean, that..
that was the deal.


250
00:20:24.353 --> 00:20:26.378
Deal?

251
00:20:26.455 --> 00:20:29.390
Who said anything about a deal?

252
00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:31.050
What?

253
00:20:31.126 --> 00:20:35.722
Wha.. W-What are
you going to do?


254
00:20:35.797 --> 00:20:37.662
Oh, no, no, no, no.

255
00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:39.792
No, no, please. Aah!

256
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.065
Oh! Oh, thank God.

257
00:20:47.142 --> 00:20:48.609
Oh, thank you.

258
00:20:48.677 --> 00:20:50.269
Still itching for a fight, Bud?

259
00:20:53.048 --> 00:20:55.175
Come on and get some of this.

260
00:20:58.954 --> 00:21:00.717
It's ok, Bob!

261
00:21:06.328 --> 00:21:07.659
Yee-haw!

262
00:21:07.729 --> 00:21:10.027
Ha ha ha! Goddamn!

263
00:21:10.098 --> 00:21:12.794
Nothin' like a little excitement
to get the old blood a-pumpin'!


264
00:21:12.868 --> 00:21:16.395
Hey, what you looking for?

265
00:21:16.471 --> 00:21:17.460
Looking for them.

266
00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:19.131
Someone following us?

267
00:21:19.208 --> 00:21:20.732
Not yet.

268
00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:24.575
Yeah, that's because it takes
time to change a flat tire.


269
00:21:24.646 --> 00:21:26.136
Did you slash their tires?

270
00:21:26.215 --> 00:21:27.409
Yeah..

271
00:21:27.482 --> 00:21:29.347
Hell, no.

272
00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:31.318
I'd have been there all night.

273
00:21:32.487 --> 00:21:33.613
How you feelin'?

274
00:21:35.224 --> 00:21:37.590
Must've got worked
over pretty good.


275
00:21:37.659 --> 00:21:39.820
I'll live.

276
00:21:41.163 --> 00:21:42.892
Thanks.

277
00:21:42.965 --> 00:21:45.365
Yeah, feeling's mutual, partner.

278
00:21:45.434 --> 00:21:47.595
Hey..

279
00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:03.616
I heard you were in early.

280
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.183
Forensics did find a
hair in that second bed.


281
00:22:08.257 --> 00:22:09.724
They're pushing it through.

282
00:22:09.792 --> 00:22:12.955
And we isolated 20 unknowns
in the videotapes.


283
00:22:21.437 --> 00:22:24.338
I ran into Billy
Coogan last night.


284
00:22:24.406 --> 00:22:29.309
He said we're leading
McGinnis 2 to 1 out his way.


285
00:22:29.378 --> 00:22:34.008
Did you end up calling in the Fed
boys on those motel killings?


286
00:22:34.083 --> 00:22:35.209
No. Why?

287
00:22:39.254 --> 00:22:41.814
'Cause it looks like
we've got company.


288
00:23:09.818 --> 00:23:12.343
You ever see anything
like that before?


289
00:23:15.557 --> 00:23:16.751
Yes.

290
00:23:18.327 --> 00:23:20.261
I'll see ya, Buck. Good
luck out there today.


291
00:23:20.329 --> 00:23:21.626
Have a good day, Jim.

292
00:23:21.697 --> 00:23:24.257
Make sure you stop by the polls.

293
00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:29.169
Sheriff Olmstead.

294
00:23:29.238 --> 00:23:30.262
Sally.

295
00:23:30.339 --> 00:23:32.671
Sally: It's coming, sheriff.

296
00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:36.701
Care for some breakfast,
Mr. Lacrosse?


297
00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:39.407
Oh, no, thank you.

298
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:40.778
So..

299
00:23:40.849 --> 00:23:43.875
what can we do for
the FBI today?


300
00:23:43.952 --> 00:23:46.182
You have 2 bodies in the morgue.

301
00:23:46.255 --> 00:23:48.689
I need the car that was
taken from the motel.


302
00:23:48.757 --> 00:23:50.486
Take a number.

303
00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:53.027
Time is critical, sheriff.

304
00:23:53.095 --> 00:23:57.054
Time is always critical,
Mr. Lacrosse.


305
00:23:58.734 --> 00:24:01.897
What makes you so sure that we're
talkin' about the same killer here?


306
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.029
Excuse me.

307
00:24:05.774 --> 00:24:07.207
Severed femoral artery,

308
00:24:07.276 --> 00:24:09.744
single incisions, 5
to 7 inches long,


309
00:24:09.812 --> 00:24:11.177
inch, inch and a half deep.

310
00:24:11.246 --> 00:24:13.180
You've seen the bodies.

311
00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:15.876
No prints, no weapon,
no witnesses.


312
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:17.748
I know this killer, sheriff,

313
00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.048
and when he kills,
he moves fast,


314
00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:20.782
and the only chance you
have of catching him


315
00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:22.153
is to find out what he's driving

316
00:24:22.224 --> 00:24:23.691
or to be incredibly lucky.

317
00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:26.922
Do you mind if I call you
by your first name, Frank?


318
00:24:26.995 --> 00:24:29.759
Now, you say you
know this killer.


319
00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:31.424
You got a physical description?

320
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.799
Height? Weight? Hair color?

321
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.997
Male between the
ages of 20 to 50,


322
00:24:37.072 --> 00:24:39.802
medium to large build,
from a western state.


323
00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:43.276
Probably spent a lot
of time in the east.


324
00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:47.008
Well, that really narrows the
field down, doesn't it, Frank?


325
00:24:47.082 --> 00:24:49.073
He's a serial killer, sheriff.

326
00:24:49.151 --> 00:24:51.881
Well, the serial killers
we've dealt with


327
00:24:51.954 --> 00:24:55.048
didn't seem to want to
have their victims found.


328
00:24:55.124 --> 00:24:56.819
This one does.

329
00:24:59.762 --> 00:25:02.925
Sally, bring me a
cup to go, please.


330
00:25:02.998 --> 00:25:04.898
Right up, Buck.

331
00:25:06.168 --> 00:25:08.602
Well, who knows, Frank?

332
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.695
Maybe we'll both
get lucky today.


333
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:22.917
Hey, Oscar.

334
00:25:22.985 --> 00:25:24.543
Hey, Buck.

335
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.487
Well, the city police spotted
the car about 4 a.m.


336
00:25:27.556 --> 00:25:31.219
The officers tailed it here, and
then instead of waiting for backup,


337
00:25:31.293 --> 00:25:33.454
one of the cops
followed him inside..


338
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:36.828
Course, that's when the
suspect started shooting.


339
00:25:36.899 --> 00:25:38.059
Just beautiful.

340
00:25:38.133 --> 00:25:40.533
Yeah, well, he's holed
up in back someplace.


341
00:25:40.602 --> 00:25:42.900
Of course, McGinnis has got
his whole swat team here now,


342
00:25:42.971 --> 00:25:45.269
and he won't let any of our
deputies near the place.


343
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.140
Course not. Hell, the TV trucks
might show up any minute.


344
00:25:49.211 --> 00:25:50.872
Speak of the devil.

345
00:26:08.063 --> 00:26:09.997
Could I have your
flashlight, please?


346
00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:12.599
Damn.

347
00:26:12.668 --> 00:26:13.862
All dressed up.

348
00:26:15.571 --> 00:26:20.133
Well, Buck, come to see how
a real operation is done?


349
00:26:20.209 --> 00:26:21.676
I declare, Jack,

350
00:26:21.743 --> 00:26:25.679
you must have calluses from patting
yourself on the back so much.


351
00:26:25.747 --> 00:26:28.341
Why don't you just give
me the facts here?


352
00:26:33.222 --> 00:26:34.314
Hold this, please.

353
00:26:34.389 --> 00:26:35.515
Yes, sir.

354
00:26:55.911 --> 00:26:58.004
Oh, my God.

355
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.742
What the hell's going
on over there?


356
00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.176
Bill!

357
00:27:03.252 --> 00:27:05.482
Christ. Allen's down.
We can't reach him.


358
00:27:05.554 --> 00:27:06.680
We're falling back.

359
00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:08.484
Bill. Bill!

360
00:27:08.557 --> 00:27:10.252
Allen's hit. He's in the room.

361
00:27:10.325 --> 00:27:12.225
I need instructions. Over.

362
00:27:16.331 --> 00:27:18.128
Get him out of there, Jack.

363
00:27:19.668 --> 00:27:20.726
Is he alone?

364
00:27:21.837 --> 00:27:22.861
Who the hell's this?

365
00:27:22.938 --> 00:27:26.533
Jack, this is Frank
Lacrosse, FBI.


366
00:27:26.608 --> 00:27:27.734
Ask him.

367
00:27:27.809 --> 00:27:28.935
Listen, mister, I
got a man down..


368
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:30.205
Ask him!

369
00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:32.270
Bill, is he alone?

370
00:27:32.347 --> 00:27:34.281
Can't tell.

371
00:27:34.349 --> 00:27:37.045
He says he's holding a
knife on one of them.


372
00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:38.609
Bill, where are you in
relation to the room?


373
00:27:38.687 --> 00:27:41.087
We're down the hall,
northwest stairwell.


374
00:27:41.156 --> 00:27:42.817
Hey! Hey!

375
00:27:44.693 --> 00:27:47.025
Bill, you're about to have some company.
Stop him!


376
00:27:50.499 --> 00:27:52.626
Man: I got a family in here!

377
00:27:52.701 --> 00:27:54.726
Give me a 2-way in
here right now!


378
00:27:54.803 --> 00:27:56.703
I want a radio!

379
00:27:58.607 --> 00:27:59.574
Only one down?

380
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:00.505
Yeah.

381
00:28:00.575 --> 00:28:02.600
Sir, Chief McGinnis said that..

382
00:28:02.678 --> 00:28:04.839
Shit. He's going into the room.

383
00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:06.608
Shut that door!

384
00:28:06.682 --> 00:28:08.240
If he gets one of
my men killed..


385
00:28:08.317 --> 00:28:11.912
Well, that'd make you look
real bad, wouldn't it, Jack?


386
00:28:11.987 --> 00:28:15.548
All this TV coverage,
you in charge.


387
00:28:20.762 --> 00:28:23.959
What's going on out there?

388
00:28:24.032 --> 00:28:26.830
I swear to God, I'll
start cutting in here!


389
00:28:28.236 --> 00:28:30.170
Who the fuck are you?

390
00:28:30.238 --> 00:28:35.574
I said I negotiate
only by radio.


391
00:28:35.644 --> 00:28:37.805
Answer me!

392
00:28:37.879 --> 00:28:40.746
Are you blind, man?
I got a knife!


393
00:28:40.816 --> 00:28:42.215
I see it.

394
00:28:45.854 --> 00:28:49.085
Uh-uh. They don't go
anywhere, or I cut him.


395
00:28:49.157 --> 00:28:51.648
They don't have a choice.

396
00:28:53.762 --> 00:28:56.128
Man, I don't know who you are,

397
00:28:56.198 --> 00:28:58.166
but I'm gonna make you pay.

398
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.694
Before you do..

399
00:29:06.174 --> 00:29:08.608
I just want to ask
you one question.


400
00:29:08.677 --> 00:29:09.871
Question?

401
00:29:09.945 --> 00:29:11.139
You're crazy.

402
00:29:11.213 --> 00:29:12.805
Where'd you get the car?

403
00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:16.282
I ain't answerin' any
of your fuck.. aah!


404
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:17.375
Who fired that shot?

405
00:29:17.452 --> 00:29:19.113
It came from inside
the apartment.


406
00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:26.655
Now.. where did you get the car?

407
00:29:26.728 --> 00:29:28.787
Car..

408
00:29:28.864 --> 00:29:31.526
The car..

409
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.397
from the motel.

410
00:29:33.468 --> 00:29:35.060
Get in there. Now.

411
00:29:35.137 --> 00:29:37.697
I don't know nothin'
about a motel.


412
00:29:37.773 --> 00:29:40.571
I boosted it a couple hours ago.

413
00:29:40.642 --> 00:29:41.973
Where?

414
00:29:42.044 --> 00:29:43.238
Where?!

415
00:29:56.258 --> 00:29:58.089
Sutherland's.

416
00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.684
Where'd this come from?

417
00:29:59.761 --> 00:30:01.251
In the car.

418
00:30:01.329 --> 00:30:03.160
Along with a body.

419
00:30:04.766 --> 00:30:07.462
Well, thanks a lot, Frank.

420
00:30:07.536 --> 00:30:11.097
32 years of dedicated
public service,


421
00:30:11.173 --> 00:30:15.269
and you just wiped the slate clean
with one quick, easy stroke.


422
00:30:15.343 --> 00:30:17.334
What are you talking about?

423
00:30:19.381 --> 00:30:22.077
Oh, hell. Never mind.

424
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.277
I'm glad you caught the killer.

425
00:30:25.921 --> 00:30:27.411
He's not the killer.

426
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.932
Good morning. Ha ha ha.

427
00:31:27.248 --> 00:31:29.307
God.. damn!

428
00:31:30.785 --> 00:31:33.549
Your 7 a.m. wake-up call.

429
00:31:33.621 --> 00:31:36.681
You know, you could have
just given me a shake.


430
00:31:36.758 --> 00:31:38.316
I wake easily.

431
00:31:46.734 --> 00:31:48.258
My God.

432
00:31:59.347 --> 00:32:00.678
Hungry?

433
00:32:06.454 --> 00:32:09.218
Hector Saldez..

434
00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.123
8 priors. 2 assaults
with a knife,


435
00:32:12.193 --> 00:32:16.220
armed robbery, conviction of
second-degree murder in Oklahoma,


436
00:32:16.297 --> 00:32:20.290
and now caught in possession of a
murder victim's wallet and car.


437
00:32:20.368 --> 00:32:23.132
All you've got on him is
possession of a stolen vehicle.


438
00:32:23.204 --> 00:32:26.696
He didn't know about the wallet
till I showed it to him.


439
00:32:26.774 --> 00:32:28.765
I bet he didn't even know
there was a body in the car.


440
00:32:28.843 --> 00:32:31.403
Says you. Ballistics have
already matched the gun


441
00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:35.506
he used on my men as the one used
to cap that John Doe in the car.


442
00:32:36.751 --> 00:32:38.719
Any more theories?

443
00:32:38.786 --> 00:32:41.880
Jack, I think all Frank's
trying to say here


444
00:32:41.956 --> 00:32:44.720
is we need to keep
our options open.


445
00:32:44.792 --> 00:32:46.054
There's no "we" in this, Buck.

446
00:32:49.964 --> 00:32:51.898
I have the suspect in custody,

447
00:32:51.966 --> 00:32:54.434
and as soon as I get the
green light from the D.A.,


448
00:32:54.502 --> 00:32:56.436
I'm going to announce that
Saldez is being charged


449
00:32:56.504 --> 00:32:58.301
with the murders
of those 3 people.


450
00:32:58.373 --> 00:32:59.635
Don't do that.

451
00:32:59.707 --> 00:33:01.470
He's setting you up.

452
00:33:01.542 --> 00:33:04.238
You make that announcement, he'll
kill again just to embarrass you.


453
00:33:04.312 --> 00:33:05.643
Embarrass me?

454
00:33:05.713 --> 00:33:08.648
I suppose you've had that happen
to you before, Mr. Lacrosse?


455
00:33:08.716 --> 00:33:10.411
Yes.

456
00:33:14.756 --> 00:33:17.350
Oh, I get it.

457
00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:19.416
Well, you would like me to
delay that announcement


458
00:33:19.494 --> 00:33:22.463
till after the election,
wouldn't you, Buck?


459
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.259
That was a nice try.

460
00:33:24.332 --> 00:33:25.993
Who the hell is this guy anyway?

461
00:33:26.067 --> 00:33:29.764
I mean, how many times you seen
an FBI agent work a case alone?


462
00:33:29.837 --> 00:33:32.169
We can find out.

463
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.971
Don't have much use for us state
and local boys, do you, Frank?


464
00:33:36.043 --> 00:33:37.977
It's a prejudice
I have, sheriff.


465
00:33:38.045 --> 00:33:39.535
No one's proved me wrong yet.

466
00:33:39.614 --> 00:33:42.515
Well, I have my problems
with Jack myself,


467
00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:45.711
but, you know, there
for a brief moment,


468
00:33:45.787 --> 00:33:49.518
I found myself thinking he was
making a lot more sense than you.


469
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.956
I don't care what
you think, sheriff.


470
00:33:52.026 --> 00:33:53.789
Maybe not,

471
00:33:53.861 --> 00:33:55.328
but you need me,

472
00:33:55.396 --> 00:33:58.263
or you'd be long gone by now.

473
00:33:58.332 --> 00:33:59.731
Why believe me and not him?

474
00:33:59.801 --> 00:34:04.704
First of all, I've seen a hell of
a lot more murders than he has,


475
00:34:04.772 --> 00:34:08.538
and these just don't seem to fit
that man he's got in lockup.


476
00:34:08.609 --> 00:34:09.906
Secondly..

477
00:34:09.977 --> 00:34:12.309
maybe you haven't noticed,
but Chief McGinnis and I


478
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.749
are engaged in an election battle for
my office which he desperately wants,


479
00:34:16.818 --> 00:34:21.619
and which l.. I'm sad to say..
am desperate to defend.


480
00:34:23.057 --> 00:34:24.081
Him?

481
00:34:24.158 --> 00:34:27.821
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.


482
00:34:27.895 --> 00:34:31.695
But the fact remains he has a
suspect in custody and I don't.


483
00:34:31.766 --> 00:34:35.566
But I'm here to tell you, Frank,

484
00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:38.469
I'm not going to be worth a damn
to you in this investigation


485
00:34:38.539 --> 00:34:40.769
unless I know what you
know about this killer.


486
00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:49.880
Ok.

487
00:34:53.287 --> 00:34:56.347
When I turned around and saw
that 30.30 staring down at me,


488
00:34:56.424 --> 00:35:00.485
I thought, wow, this is it.

489
00:35:00.561 --> 00:35:02.529
No joining the birds this time.

490
00:35:02.597 --> 00:35:04.224
Joining the what?

491
00:35:04.298 --> 00:35:07.495
Old railroaders used to say
that if you were on a train


492
00:35:07.568 --> 00:35:11.402
that was about to crash and
you had a chance to jump,


493
00:35:11.472 --> 00:35:12.734
you were joining the birds.

494
00:35:12.807 --> 00:35:14.798
You worked on the railroad.

495
00:35:14.876 --> 00:35:16.810
For a while.

496
00:35:16.878 --> 00:35:21.178
Mined a while, cowboy'd a while.

497
00:35:21.249 --> 00:35:23.877
Fact, I did a little bit
of everything up here.


498
00:35:23.951 --> 00:35:25.441
Man: Hey, Fae, is
this ticket right?


499
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.489
How we gonna get through
with the storm?


500
00:35:28.556 --> 00:35:31.184
Ain't gonna affect us much.
It's going north.


501
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:36.887
What about you, Lane Dixon?

502
00:35:36.964 --> 00:35:40.297
What kind of work you do?

503
00:35:40.368 --> 00:35:42.768
I'm between jobs right now.

504
00:35:42.837 --> 00:35:44.327
Before that.

505
00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:47.340
Before that, uh..

506
00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:49.103
I worked in a hospital.

507
00:35:49.176 --> 00:35:50.973
Orderly? Nurse?

508
00:35:51.045 --> 00:35:53.275
Well, I did a little
bit of everything.


509
00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.181
That's what's in Utah, a job?

510
00:35:57.251 --> 00:36:01.551
No. I've just been, uh..
traveling.


511
00:36:03.257 --> 00:36:04.781
It's my first time west.

512
00:36:04.859 --> 00:36:06.656
Cook: Come over from Alamosa?

513
00:36:06.727 --> 00:36:07.989
- Yep.
- How is it up there?


514
00:36:08.062 --> 00:36:10.690
It's not bad. Worst
of it's going north.


515
00:36:10.765 --> 00:36:12.699
Well, we've been watching
it come down here


516
00:36:12.767 --> 00:36:14.359
for the last hour or so.

517
00:36:14.435 --> 00:36:15.595
How'd you know?

518
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.730
My father used to say,

519
00:36:18.806 --> 00:36:20.433
"Weather don't make the rules.

520
00:36:20.508 --> 00:36:22.976
Mountains do."

521
00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:25.945
And I know the mountains.

522
00:36:26.013 --> 00:36:27.105
How y'all doing?

523
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:30.275
We're doing just fine here.

524
00:36:30.351 --> 00:36:31.978
How about you, darlin'?
Get you anything?


525
00:36:32.053 --> 00:36:34.954
I'm ok, thanks.

526
00:36:35.022 --> 00:36:37.718
Your friend's cute, but shy.

527
00:36:37.792 --> 00:36:39.384
I'm gonna get a paper.

528
00:36:43.898 --> 00:36:46.298
Now, did I scare him off?

529
00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:48.665
Tell him I won't bite if
he looks me in the eye.


530
00:37:00.915 --> 00:37:02.348
You all right?

531
00:37:02.416 --> 00:37:03.405
He's chokin'.

532
00:37:03.484 --> 00:37:05.816
He ain't breathing.
Call an ambulance.


533
00:37:08.055 --> 00:37:10.148
God damn it, Fae,
call the ambulance!


534
00:37:10.224 --> 00:37:11.714
Is he gonna die?

535
00:37:11.792 --> 00:37:13.191
Let me look at him.
I'm a doctor.


536
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.557
Get back. Let him look at him.

537
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.401
He's got something
really jammed in there.


538
00:37:25.873 --> 00:37:27.363
God, he's turning blue.

539
00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:29.306
Get in the kitchen, Fae.
God damn it, go on!


540
00:37:30.645 --> 00:37:33.079
Get him on the counter.

541
00:37:38.319 --> 00:37:39.980
I'm going to need
a first-aid kit.


542
00:37:44.558 --> 00:37:46.082
I need some alcohol.

543
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.958
And give me that right there.

544
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.190
Open up his shirt.

545
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:57.801
Ok, open the bottle.

546
00:37:59.407 --> 00:38:00.271
Now pour.

547
00:38:13.721 --> 00:38:14.881
Oh, my God.

548
00:38:14.955 --> 00:38:17.549
God damn it, Fae, get in..

549
00:38:22.163 --> 00:38:25.599
God damn! Dr. Dixon.

550
00:38:25.666 --> 00:38:26.598
Don't call me that.

551
00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:29.101
Hey, I didn't make that up.

552
00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:30.637
You called yourself one.

553
00:38:30.705 --> 00:38:32.104
It clears a path.

554
00:38:32.173 --> 00:38:34.004
Don't give me that bullshit.

555
00:38:34.075 --> 00:38:37.135
What you did in there wasn't something
you picked up out of some book.


556
00:38:37.211 --> 00:38:38.473
You've had training.

557
00:38:38.546 --> 00:38:40.980
Now, maybe you've been in
medical school and dropped out,


558
00:38:41.048 --> 00:38:42.140
or maybe you been in the army,

559
00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:44.810
but you don't lie to me
that you're no doctor


560
00:38:44.885 --> 00:38:47.683
because I was just in the
operating room with you.


561
00:38:47.755 --> 00:38:51.122
I don't want to talk about it.

562
00:38:55.796 --> 00:38:58.094
Dr. Dixon.

563
00:39:03.304 --> 00:39:07.408
He kills for the
sensation of power.


564
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:09.338
He started with the
unconnected victim.


565
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:10.809
No one missed them
when they were alive,


566
00:39:10.878 --> 00:39:13.870
and it was a long time before anyone
realized that they were gone.


567
00:39:13.947 --> 00:39:17.713
He is credited with at
least 18 known deaths.


568
00:39:17.785 --> 00:39:19.776
No way of knowing how many came

569
00:39:19.853 --> 00:39:21.445
before he began telling
me about them.


570
00:39:21.522 --> 00:39:23.786
He tells you about them.

571
00:39:23.857 --> 00:39:24.846
What's he do, call you?

572
00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:28.053
He writes. He sends me these.

573
00:39:30.097 --> 00:39:32.190
Buck: Why you, Frank?

574
00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:35.258
I headed a task force that
tracked him for 15 months.


575
00:39:35.335 --> 00:39:38.634
After the task force
formed, he changed.


576
00:39:38.705 --> 00:39:40.332
He got bolder.

577
00:39:40.407 --> 00:39:43.171
He started taking more risks.

578
00:39:43.243 --> 00:39:46.406
He began to see the murders
as a kind of competition.


579
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.448
He turned it into a
damn game on you.


580
00:39:48.515 --> 00:39:49.539
Yes.

581
00:39:49.616 --> 00:39:52.517
And he took his publicity
very seriously.


582
00:39:52.586 --> 00:39:55.316
But it got harder for him.

583
00:39:55.389 --> 00:39:58.187
He started making mistakes.
We got closer.


584
00:39:58.258 --> 00:40:01.785
Then 3 months ago..

585
00:40:01.862 --> 00:40:03.489
he just stopped.

586
00:40:04.865 --> 00:40:05.797
Why?

587
00:40:05.866 --> 00:40:07.458
I don't know.

588
00:40:09.203 --> 00:40:11.068
He's been quiet ever since.

589
00:40:14.274 --> 00:40:15.764
I need to make a call.

590
00:40:15.843 --> 00:40:19.711
Go ahead on in and use the
phone in my office, Frank.


591
00:40:27.888 --> 00:40:31.415
There ain't no doubt about it.
He knows this killer.


592
00:40:36.663 --> 00:40:38.631
What are you thinking, Nate?

593
00:40:40.467 --> 00:40:42.697
I'm thinkin' it's 8
a.m., polls are open,


594
00:40:42.769 --> 00:40:45.431
and I hope to God we're
hunting the right man.


595
00:40:45.506 --> 00:40:47.030
It's me.

596
00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:50.973
Amarillo.

597
00:40:51.044 --> 00:40:53.103
Since about 4:00 this morning.

598
00:40:56.884 --> 00:40:58.875
No, I was too late again.

599
00:41:03.257 --> 00:41:05.748
They did?

600
00:41:05.826 --> 00:41:07.054
When?

601
00:41:09.897 --> 00:41:11.228
What did you tell them?

602
00:41:15.836 --> 00:41:17.633
Don't cry, honey.

603
00:41:20.641 --> 00:41:23.041
No, I don't think that
they know I'm here yet.


604
00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.216
We'll deal with
that when it comes.


605
00:41:34.855 --> 00:41:36.015
I love you.

606
00:41:39.626 --> 00:41:42.026
You're a strange one, Doc.

607
00:41:42.095 --> 00:41:45.462
You're smart, cool
under pressure.


608
00:41:45.532 --> 00:41:46.829
Yet something's bothering you.

609
00:41:48.835 --> 00:41:50.894
Fine. You don't want
to talk about it,


610
00:41:50.971 --> 00:41:52.165
that's your business.

611
00:41:52.239 --> 00:41:53.206
I quit.

612
00:41:53.273 --> 00:41:57.505
I was a first-year intern.

613
00:41:57.578 --> 00:42:00.672
I was good.

614
00:42:00.747 --> 00:42:04.239
Hell, I was cocky I
thought I was so good.


615
00:42:04.318 --> 00:42:05.546
When it started to get heavy,

616
00:42:05.619 --> 00:42:08.053
I used to watch other
post-graduates wash out,


617
00:42:08.121 --> 00:42:11.716
and I'd think, "That'll
never happen to me."


618
00:42:13.493 --> 00:42:16.326
Well.. here I am.

619
00:42:16.396 --> 00:42:17.829
What happened?

620
00:42:17.898 --> 00:42:19.365
You have a patient die
on you or something?


621
00:42:19.433 --> 00:42:21.424
Yeah.

622
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:23.162
Hell, that's gonna happen.

623
00:42:23.236 --> 00:42:25.830
But you go home, get some sleep,

624
00:42:25.906 --> 00:42:27.703
get up the next day
and try again.


625
00:42:27.774 --> 00:42:29.503
Yeah, I did.

626
00:42:29.576 --> 00:42:31.874
It just, uh..

627
00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:33.469
I couldn't shake it, you know?

628
00:42:33.547 --> 00:42:35.481
Well, you seemed cured today.

629
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:38.985
This time.

630
00:42:39.052 --> 00:42:40.076
But what about the next time?

631
00:42:40.153 --> 00:42:42.417
What do you want, guarantees?

632
00:42:42.489 --> 00:42:43.888
There ain't no guarantees.

633
00:42:52.332 --> 00:42:55.961
What a waste.

634
00:42:56.036 --> 00:42:57.867
Yeah. I've heard that before.

635
00:42:57.938 --> 00:43:00.566
Yeah, bet you have.

636
00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:03.940
And like anyone else in your life,
I got nothing invested in you.


637
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:06.172
My father used to say,

638
00:43:06.246 --> 00:43:09.977
"Nerve succeeds."

639
00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.314
You've got the nerve, Doc,

640
00:43:12.386 --> 00:43:15.355
and I've seen it up close.

641
00:43:15.422 --> 00:43:18.983
If you really were a quitter,

642
00:43:19.059 --> 00:43:21.527
you would have stood around
like the rest of us.


643
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.060
As of 7:30 this morning, we have

644
00:43:29.136 --> 00:43:30.398
3 of those are women..

645
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.234
and 5 homeless who didn't
report to shelters last night.


646
00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:35.297
Rule out the homeless.

647
00:43:35.375 --> 00:43:37.639
He needed transportation.

648
00:43:37.711 --> 00:43:38.769
Sheriff?

649
00:43:38.845 --> 00:43:41.837
Mr. Saldez's attorney,
Mr. Martinez, is here,


650
00:43:41.915 --> 00:43:45.214
and he is breathing fire about
Mr. Lacrosse shooting his client.


651
00:43:45.285 --> 00:43:46.980
Thank you, Becky.

652
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:57.492
We really do need for this guy
to cooperate with us, Frank.


653
00:43:57.564 --> 00:43:58.826
Mmm.

654
00:43:58.899 --> 00:44:01.231
Maybe Nate and I ought
to talk to him alone.


655
00:44:02.803 --> 00:44:05.499
No. I'll talk to him.

656
00:44:08.141 --> 00:44:09.073
Ok.

657
00:44:11.044 --> 00:44:13.205
Mr. Lacrosse? The lab
reports just came back


658
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.942
about that hair they
found in the bed.


659
00:44:16.016 --> 00:44:18.484
It is definitely not Saldez's.

660
00:44:21.922 --> 00:44:23.685
A 36052.

661
00:44:25.225 --> 00:44:26.317
I beg your pardon?

662
00:44:28.762 --> 00:44:31.196
Special agent Frank Lacrosse,

663
00:44:31.264 --> 00:44:32.663
am I glad to see you.

664
00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:34.701
Mr. Martinez, thank
you for coming in.


665
00:44:34.768 --> 00:44:36.201
I wouldn't miss it.

666
00:44:36.269 --> 00:44:37.827
I wanted to thank you personally

667
00:44:37.904 --> 00:44:40.964
for making my job of
defending Hector Saldez


668
00:44:41.041 --> 00:44:42.303
such an easy one.

669
00:44:42.375 --> 00:44:43.501
Really?

670
00:44:43.577 --> 00:44:44.509
How's that?

671
00:44:44.578 --> 00:44:45.977
How's that?

672
00:44:46.046 --> 00:44:50.039
How's violating three of his
constitutional rights for starters?


673
00:44:50.117 --> 00:44:53.018
Torturing him? Illegally
questioning him?


674
00:44:53.086 --> 00:44:55.554
Failure to advise
him of his rights?


675
00:44:55.622 --> 00:44:57.852
Oh, Mr. Lacrosse,
you're a godsend.


676
00:44:57.924 --> 00:45:00.688
Jorge.. may I remind you

677
00:45:00.761 --> 00:45:03.628
that your client was holding
a knife on an innocent man?


678
00:45:03.697 --> 00:45:05.961
You can remind me all
you want to, sheriff.


679
00:45:06.032 --> 00:45:07.624
It ain't going to mean
jack to the jury.


680
00:45:07.701 --> 00:45:09.669
So I take it you don't
wish to cooperate with us?


681
00:45:09.736 --> 00:45:12.398
What, are you kidding?

682
00:45:12.472 --> 00:45:15.066
I came here to thank
you personally


683
00:45:15.142 --> 00:45:18.543
on behalf of my client who I
will also be representing


684
00:45:18.612 --> 00:45:20.876
in civil proceedings
against you and the city.


685
00:45:20.947 --> 00:45:23.916
Good day, gentlemen.

686
00:45:23.984 --> 00:45:25.815
Sit down, Mr. Martinez.

687
00:45:25.886 --> 00:45:27.911
You didn't hear what I said?
I'm not staying.


688
00:45:27.988 --> 00:45:29.387
Oh, yes, you are.

689
00:45:29.456 --> 00:45:31.981
What are you going to
do, special agent?


690
00:45:32.058 --> 00:45:33.389
Are you going to put
a bullet in me, too?


691
00:45:35.095 --> 00:45:38.531
Uh, excuse me, sir. The
lab report just got back.


692
00:45:38.598 --> 00:45:40.930
It was a 36052.

693
00:45:41.001 --> 00:45:42.468
Thank you, Bud.

694
00:45:46.106 --> 00:45:48.233
Bud, what the hell are
you talking about?


695
00:45:51.611 --> 00:45:55.877
I'm sorry, Mr. Martinez.
I've wasted your time.


696
00:45:55.949 --> 00:45:59.248
Um, what do you
mean by that 360..


697
00:45:59.319 --> 00:46:00.650
Oh, that's a lab term.

698
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.950
It's about a hair we
found in the motel.


699
00:46:03.023 --> 00:46:04.388
We'll see you in court.

700
00:46:04.457 --> 00:46:05.947
- Lab term?
- Yeah.


701
00:46:06.026 --> 00:46:07.618
'Cause, look, you wanted to
know about the car, right?


702
00:46:07.694 --> 00:46:09.252
Oh, that's no longer necessary.

703
00:46:11.431 --> 00:46:13.899
'Cause l.. I could tell
you if we made a deal.


704
00:46:13.967 --> 00:46:16.936
Jorge..

705
00:46:17.003 --> 00:46:18.265
Deal..

706
00:46:18.338 --> 00:46:20.704
What kind of deal are
we talking about here?


707
00:46:20.774 --> 00:46:22.366
Drop the murder charges,

708
00:46:22.442 --> 00:46:23.932
and I'll tell you where
he found the Explorer.


709
00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.944
Forget it.

710
00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:31.647
You know you can't
prove anything.


711
00:46:31.718 --> 00:46:33.652
We'll see.

712
00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:37.619
Sometimes you win,

713
00:46:37.691 --> 00:46:39.682
sometimes you lose, amigo.

714
00:46:44.364 --> 00:46:45.991
He boosted the car
at the airport.


715
00:46:46.066 --> 00:46:48.534
Long-term parking, lot "C."

716
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.601
Get that list of stolen cars.

717
00:46:51.671 --> 00:46:53.639
Thank you, Mr. Martinez.

718
00:46:53.707 --> 00:46:55.971
What about the hair?

719
00:46:56.042 --> 00:46:57.031
Oh, yeah.

720
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:59.544
It belonged to a male
in his early 20s.


721
00:46:59.613 --> 00:47:00.978
Brown.

722
00:47:01.047 --> 00:47:03.743
Son of a bitch.

723
00:47:03.817 --> 00:47:05.250
Son of a bitch.

724
00:47:07.921 --> 00:47:09.752
Go back to the waitresses
at the restaurant.


725
00:47:09.823 --> 00:47:11.586
See if that hair color
sparks anything.


726
00:47:11.658 --> 00:47:13.455
You got it, Mr. Lacrosse.

727
00:47:13.526 --> 00:47:16.723
They teach you that
little 36052 maneuver


728
00:47:16.796 --> 00:47:18.764
back at the academy,
did they, Frank?


729
00:47:18.832 --> 00:47:21.460
No. My wife did.

730
00:47:21.534 --> 00:47:24.867
And what is she, a con woman?

731
00:47:24.938 --> 00:47:26.200
Sort of.

732
00:47:26.273 --> 00:47:27.831
She's a lawyer.

733
00:47:27.908 --> 00:47:32.402
Airport security does have videotape
on all the license plates


734
00:47:32.479 --> 00:47:34.572
coming and going from
long-term parking.


735
00:47:34.648 --> 00:47:36.616
We're going to pull
the last 24 hours


736
00:47:36.683 --> 00:47:38.617
and cross-check that
with stolen vehicles.


737
00:47:38.685 --> 00:47:42.883
Well, Frank, it looks like you may
have just gotten your first big break.


738
00:47:45.592 --> 00:47:47.389
I think we ought to make
an announcement, Buck.


739
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.325
Announcement?

740
00:47:49.396 --> 00:47:50.488
We don't know anything yet.

741
00:47:50.563 --> 00:47:53.930
We know it's not Saldez.

742
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.264
We can blow McGinnis' case
clear out of the water.


743
00:47:56.336 --> 00:47:57.428
No.

744
00:47:57.504 --> 00:47:59.062
You do that, you'd be
letting the real killer


745
00:47:59.139 --> 00:48:00.629
know that we're onto him.

746
00:48:02.909 --> 00:48:05.969
I think we'd be making
a big mistake, Buck.


747
00:48:06.046 --> 00:48:08.173
Most of the folks in town
here are going to be voting


748
00:48:08.248 --> 00:48:10.478
on their lunch hour.
We still got time.


749
00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:12.040
Is that what's going on here,

750
00:48:12.118 --> 00:48:14.086
winning an election?

751
00:48:14.154 --> 00:48:16.554
Winning that election is
my goddamn livelihood.


752
00:48:16.623 --> 00:48:18.818
Now, I know you don't give a
tinker's damn about that,


753
00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:21.554
but I've been working hard
in this office for 15 years,


754
00:48:21.628 --> 00:48:23.562
and if Jack McGinnis wins,

755
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.757
Buck Olmstead ain't the only one
who's gonna lose out around here.


756
00:48:25.832 --> 00:48:30.030
The only reason McGinnis has
not made that announcement


757
00:48:30.103 --> 00:48:32.435
is because he doesn't have
enough to charge Saldez.


758
00:48:32.505 --> 00:48:35.633
And until that time comes,

759
00:48:35.709 --> 00:48:37.939
we just stand pat.

760
00:48:38.011 --> 00:48:41.208
Sheriff, telephone.

761
00:48:49.522 --> 00:48:52.082
Sheriff Olmstead.
How can I help you?


762
00:48:52.158 --> 00:48:55.218
Sheriff, Grant Montgomery,
FBI here in Dallas.


763
00:48:55.295 --> 00:48:57.229
I understand Frank Lacrosse
is in your custody.


764
00:48:57.297 --> 00:48:59.424
Well, he's here. He's
not in my custody.


765
00:48:59.499 --> 00:49:02.400
Well, I'll be arriving in a couple
of hours to take him off your hands.


766
00:49:02.468 --> 00:49:05.403
Mr. Montgomery, he's
working on a case here.


767
00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:08.702
Shouldn't be. Should be in
Philadelphia on another assignment,


768
00:49:08.775 --> 00:49:11.972
which he left 24 hours ago
without authorization.


769
00:49:12.045 --> 00:49:14.172
And this isn't the
first time, sheriff.


770
00:49:14.247 --> 00:49:16.681
He's left duty posts 3 times
in the last 2 months.


771
00:49:16.749 --> 00:49:18.546
He's currently on
bureau probation.


772
00:49:18.618 --> 00:49:19.949
You want to tell me
what he did wrong?


773
00:49:20.019 --> 00:49:21.316
Not your problem, sheriff,

774
00:49:21.387 --> 00:49:23.947
but I'd appreciate it if you'd
hold him till we get there.


775
00:49:24.023 --> 00:49:27.083
What about your ongoing
investigation with this killer?


776
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.924
Is that what he told you?

777
00:49:29.996 --> 00:49:34.296
There is no ongoing FBI
investigation, sheriff.


778
00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:36.927
The case has been closed
for nearly 3 months.


779
00:49:37.003 --> 00:49:37.970
That's impossible.

780
00:49:38.037 --> 00:49:38.969
Look, sheriff..

781
00:49:39.038 --> 00:49:40.300
No. You look!

782
00:49:40.373 --> 00:49:43.536
Now, I got 3 people
dead in this town,


783
00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:45.703
and you tell me you're coming
to pick up the only man


784
00:49:45.778 --> 00:49:48.144
that seems to know what
the hell is going on?


785
00:49:48.214 --> 00:49:50.148
Now, I want some answers.

786
00:49:50.216 --> 00:49:52.548
I don't give a shit
what you want.


787
00:49:52.619 --> 00:49:55.019
Right now, the only thing
that you'd better deal with


788
00:49:55.088 --> 00:49:57.989
is keeping that man in your
sight till I get there.


789
00:49:58.057 --> 00:49:59.991
Now, if that's too much to ask
I can have a U.S. Marshal


790
00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:02.050
in your office in 5 minutes

791
00:50:02.128 --> 00:50:03.789
who can handle that
kind of responsibility.


792
00:50:03.863 --> 00:50:05.353
Are we clear, sheriff?

793
00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:15.902
Buck, what's going on?

794
00:50:15.975 --> 00:50:17.533
I don't know.

795
00:50:19.579 --> 00:50:21.308
Lane: What's wrong with it?

796
00:50:21.381 --> 00:50:23.508
It's not tuned for
this elevation.


797
00:50:23.583 --> 00:50:24.845
Did you fix it?

798
00:50:24.917 --> 00:50:27.511
Naw.

799
00:50:27.587 --> 00:50:30.078
Just patched it till we
get to the next town.


800
00:50:30.156 --> 00:50:32.124
And where is that?

801
00:50:32.191 --> 00:50:33.590
Not far.

802
00:50:36.896 --> 00:50:38.386
Find everything ok, Frank?

803
00:50:38.464 --> 00:50:39.897
Yeah. Thanks.

804
00:50:45.805 --> 00:50:48.205
Is this your wife on the horse?

805
00:50:48.274 --> 00:50:49.969
Yep.

806
00:50:50.043 --> 00:50:51.271
Beautiful woman.

807
00:50:51.344 --> 00:50:52.402
Thanks, Frank.

808
00:50:52.478 --> 00:50:56.847
We had 33 wonderful
years together.


809
00:50:56.916 --> 00:50:59.714
She passed on..

810
00:50:59.786 --> 00:51:01.048
2 years ago.

811
00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.088
I'm sorry.

812
00:51:04.957 --> 00:51:06.390
How about you, Frank?

813
00:51:06.459 --> 00:51:08.222
Where'd you meet your wife at?

814
00:51:08.294 --> 00:51:09.420
In law school.

815
00:51:09.495 --> 00:51:12.191
So you're a lawyer, too.

816
00:51:12.265 --> 00:51:13.664
I never took the bar.

817
00:51:13.733 --> 00:51:16.099
I did an internship one
summer with the bureau


818
00:51:16.169 --> 00:51:18.069
and never looked back.

819
00:51:18.137 --> 00:51:19.900
Any children?

820
00:51:21.474 --> 00:51:22.406
One.

821
00:51:24.377 --> 00:51:25.742
And what does your wife think

822
00:51:25.812 --> 00:51:29.373
about you traipsing all over the
countryside chasing banditos?


823
00:51:29.449 --> 00:51:32.714
Oh, actually, she's
very understanding.


824
00:51:32.785 --> 00:51:34.275
That's key.

825
00:51:34.354 --> 00:51:37.380
Sit down and eat.

826
00:51:37.457 --> 00:51:39.425
Plenty more where
that came from.


827
00:51:39.492 --> 00:51:40.550
No, thank you.

828
00:51:40.626 --> 00:51:42.594
Nonsense.

829
00:51:42.662 --> 00:51:47.031
I make the very best BLTs in
this part of the country.


830
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.261
The secret's in the tomato.

831
00:51:49.335 --> 00:51:50.962
Built a greenhouse out back..

832
00:51:51.037 --> 00:51:52.299
He took my son.

833
00:52:08.621 --> 00:52:11.590
You asked me why he
stopped killing.


834
00:52:11.657 --> 00:52:14.524
We were getting close.
We had several breaks.


835
00:52:14.594 --> 00:52:16.755
Outside of Boston, we
had roadblocks set up


836
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:19.320
within 20 minutes
of a murder there,


837
00:52:19.399 --> 00:52:20.798
and he slipped through them.

838
00:52:20.867 --> 00:52:23.563
Everybody felt it was
just a matter of time


839
00:52:23.636 --> 00:52:25.103
before we nailed that guy.

840
00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.669
And then he took my son.

841
00:52:31.043 --> 00:52:32.374
And by doing that, he..

842
00:52:32.445 --> 00:52:35.005
He removed you from the case.

843
00:52:38.918 --> 00:52:43.218
The bureau gave the kidnapping
the highest priority.


844
00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:49.451
2 weeks later, they found this
man at a motel in Wisconsin.


845
00:52:49.529 --> 00:52:54.159
His prints matched those
found on my door,


846
00:52:54.233 --> 00:52:57.031
and with his body, we found
detailed notes about the victims.


847
00:52:57.103 --> 00:53:00.266
Dates, places, things only
the killer would know.


848
00:53:00.339 --> 00:53:02.569
Obviously, you don't
think the guy's dead.


849
00:53:02.642 --> 00:53:06.043
It was too easy.

850
00:53:06.112 --> 00:53:09.445
I tracked this man
for 18 months.


851
00:53:09.515 --> 00:53:10.641
I know him.

852
00:53:10.716 --> 00:53:13.651
He used that guy
to end the chase.


853
00:53:13.719 --> 00:53:17.849
Among the notes..

854
00:53:17.924 --> 00:53:19.221
they found this.

855
00:53:23.162 --> 00:53:25.289
That's my little boy.

856
00:53:28.191 --> 00:53:31.691
2-18.. To find him, you must kill me.
To UNDERSTAND me, you must come
to BELIEVE.


857
00:53:32.038 --> 00:53:33.062
"Believe."

858
00:53:33.139 --> 00:53:35.630
Believe in what?

859
00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:37.573
I don't know.

860
00:53:39.745 --> 00:53:40.905
2-18?

861
00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.472
18 victims, 18th of February..

862
00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:46.245
Day after tomorrow.

863
00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:49.345
I assume your people have
checked all this out?


864
00:53:49.422 --> 00:53:50.389
Yeah.

865
00:53:50.456 --> 00:53:52.321
They found nothing.

866
00:53:55.895 --> 00:53:59.058
What about your son, Frank?

867
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:02.032
Do you really think
he's still alive?


868
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:04.535
I don't have a choice.

869
00:54:04.637 --> 00:54:10.837
Texas plate, 234-4S3.

870
00:54:23.122 --> 00:54:26.023
"James Ruskin."

871
00:54:26.092 --> 00:54:27.457
Ruskin.

872
00:54:27.527 --> 00:54:29.995
James.. That's a hit.

873
00:54:30.062 --> 00:54:32.587
James Ruskin, missing out
of Midland 2 days ago.


874
00:54:32.665 --> 00:54:33.996
What's he driving?

875
00:54:34.066 --> 00:54:36.557
'77 Cadillac Eldorado, white.

876
00:54:36.636 --> 00:54:38.297
We got it. Put the word out.

877
00:54:38.371 --> 00:54:40.498
That fellow and me,

878
00:54:40.573 --> 00:54:43.872
we went to school together,
went to work together,


879
00:54:43.943 --> 00:54:46.503
he was the best man
at my wedding.


880
00:54:46.579 --> 00:54:48.843
I broke my back 2 years ago.

881
00:54:48.915 --> 00:54:51.782
You want to guess who fed my
kids while I was laid up?


882
00:54:51.851 --> 00:54:55.412
Come on, Shorty. Make
me sound like a saint.


883
00:54:55.488 --> 00:54:57.581
That's broken, Bob.

884
00:54:57.657 --> 00:55:00.023
Could you hand me one
of those spark plugs?


885
00:55:02.361 --> 00:55:03.453
There you go.

886
00:55:03.529 --> 00:55:04.757
Thanks.

887
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.492
What kind of work
did you guys do?


888
00:55:07.567 --> 00:55:11.059
We cleared passes
for the Rio Grande.


889
00:55:11.137 --> 00:55:12.536
You know, a storm like this

890
00:55:12.605 --> 00:55:15.802
can drop 1 1/2 to 2
feet in these passes.


891
00:55:15.875 --> 00:55:17.035
Somebody's got to clear 'em up

892
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:18.371
so the freight can get through.

893
00:55:18.444 --> 00:55:19.604
That was our job.

894
00:55:19.679 --> 00:55:21.442
And when did you
start doing this?


895
00:55:21.514 --> 00:55:24.915
Well, I was in the
service for a while,


896
00:55:24.984 --> 00:55:27.282
I got married, had a family.

897
00:55:27.353 --> 00:55:29.446
I guess I figured I'd
better not tempt fate.


898
00:55:32.425 --> 00:55:35.656
You're listening to
the Country King.


899
00:55:35.728 --> 00:55:37.423
620 on your dial.

900
00:55:37.496 --> 00:55:39.896
And now the news.

901
00:55:39.966 --> 00:55:41.490
Amarillo City police
have confirmed..


902
00:55:41.567 --> 00:55:43.159
Hey, Bob, turn
that up, will you?


903
00:55:43.235 --> 00:55:44.998
Suspect in custody in
connection with the shooting


904
00:55:45.071 --> 00:55:47.596
in a local apartment complex
early this morning.


905
00:55:47.673 --> 00:55:49.504
Sources close to
the investigation


906
00:55:49.575 --> 00:55:52.510
say the suspect may
have some connection


907
00:55:52.578 --> 00:55:54.705
with the 2 brutal murders
at a local motel


908
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:57.613
and a third body discovered
at the apartment complex.


909
00:55:57.683 --> 00:56:01.050
You fellas been following those
murders down in Amarillo?


910
00:56:02.421 --> 00:56:04.514
It's a bad business.

911
00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:06.490
The last 2 days, I've
been carrying this.


912
00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:09.756
You be careful with that.

913
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:12.491
Can't be too careful
is what I say.


914
00:56:15.968 --> 00:56:17.162
You goin' somewhere?

915
00:56:17.236 --> 00:56:18.601
Stretch my legs.

916
00:56:18.671 --> 00:56:20.036
How long before we're
outta here, Shorty?


917
00:56:20.106 --> 00:56:21.038
Oh, about 10 minutes,

918
00:56:21.107 --> 00:56:22.597
but you ain't goin' anywhere.

919
00:56:22.675 --> 00:56:24.438
You're staying with us tonight.

920
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:25.442
Next time.

921
00:56:30.116 --> 00:56:31.549
Sweet tooth.

922
00:56:31.617 --> 00:56:33.084
What?

923
00:56:33.152 --> 00:56:34.710
Bob wouldn't tell you,

924
00:56:34.787 --> 00:56:37.551
but he's got a
vicious sweet tooth.


925
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.701
Pretty when it comes
down like that.


926
00:56:53.772 --> 00:56:55.501
Yeah. And if it
gets any prettier,


927
00:56:55.573 --> 00:56:57.063
I'll be spending the night here.

928
00:56:57.142 --> 00:57:00.111
I just want to pick
up some candy.


929
00:57:00.178 --> 00:57:02.476
Sure.

930
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:06.582
Pretty quiet.

931
00:57:06.651 --> 00:57:08.619
Quiet isn't the word.

932
00:57:08.687 --> 00:57:10.848
I broke my tail to
get into work today,


933
00:57:10.922 --> 00:57:13.413
nearly ran off the road
twice, and for what?


934
00:57:13.491 --> 00:57:15.857
You're the first person
I've seen today.


935
00:57:15.927 --> 00:57:17.758
What about your boss?

936
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:21.526
Oh, well, he calls and tells
me he can't make it in.


937
00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:23.760
I told him, even Braddock's
across the street is closed,


938
00:57:23.835 --> 00:57:27.100
but does he tell me to lock up
and go home before I get stuck?


939
00:57:27.172 --> 00:57:28.639
Course not.

940
00:57:28.707 --> 00:57:30.140
What can I get for you?

941
00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:32.039
Candy corn. Small bag.

942
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:33.771
Ok.

943
00:57:33.845 --> 00:57:36.405
Why don't you just lock the
store up and not tell him?


944
00:57:36.481 --> 00:57:40.144
Oh.. ha! ..I would, but he's
going to call and check on me.


945
00:57:40.218 --> 00:57:42.880
Otherwise, believe me,
I'd be out of here.


946
00:57:46.758 --> 00:57:49.989
Hey, listen, I didn't mean
to bend your ear with this.


947
00:57:50.061 --> 00:57:52.120
It's 2.75.

948
00:57:55.834 --> 00:57:57.461
- Oh, that's him.

949
00:58:22.193 --> 00:58:23.660
Better tell Bob.

950
00:58:23.728 --> 00:58:24.854
Hey, Shorty.

951
00:58:24.929 --> 00:58:26.396
Hey, John.

952
00:58:26.464 --> 00:58:27.522
How about some gas?

953
00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:30.625
Comin' right up.
Finished for the day?


954
00:58:30.702 --> 00:58:32.465
Just starting. Whew!

955
00:58:32.537 --> 00:58:35.563
'77 Eldorado. Yours?

956
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.235
No. It's a friend of mine's.

957
00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.270
She's a beaut.

958
00:58:43.348 --> 00:58:44.906
Wait till you see the interior.

959
00:58:47.952 --> 00:58:50.147
Whoa, baby!

960
00:58:50.221 --> 00:58:51.518
Whoo.

961
00:58:51.656 --> 00:58:54.420
Yeah, that's right, Larry. Not
a soul the entire morning.


962
00:59:05.136 --> 00:59:07.070
Yeah, well, I wish
you were paying me


963
00:59:07.138 --> 00:59:09.106
what you're spending
to heat the place.


964
00:59:14.112 --> 00:59:15.579
Uh-huh.

965
00:59:18.249 --> 00:59:19.307
Yeah.

966
00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.312
Yeah.

967
00:59:36.901 --> 00:59:39.426
See you tomorrow.

968
00:59:39.504 --> 00:59:40.937
You didn't take my money.

969
00:59:41.005 --> 00:59:42.632
Oh, forget it.

970
00:59:42.707 --> 00:59:44.937
If I rang it up, he'd see it
tomorrow and give me hell.


971
00:59:45.009 --> 00:59:47.671
Well, at least let me buy
you a cup of coffee.


972
00:59:47.745 --> 00:59:49.679
Thanks..

973
00:59:49.747 --> 00:59:53.046
but I'd better hit the road
while I got the chance.


974
00:59:57.088 --> 01:00:00.888
Hey, I hate to ask, but I might
need a hand getting my car out.


975
01:00:00.959 --> 01:00:05.419
If you would't mind
helping me, and then..


976
01:00:05.496 --> 01:00:06.963
Maybe.

977
01:00:07.031 --> 01:00:09.556
Maybe?

978
01:00:09.634 --> 01:00:12.501
You wouldn't be leading
me on, would you?


979
01:00:19.377 --> 01:00:20.776
- Bob?

980
01:00:30.288 --> 01:00:31.949
Shorty's finished with the car.

981
01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:33.991
Thanks for coming
in and telling me.


982
01:00:37.195 --> 01:00:39.163
Sorry I can't help you.

983
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:41.357
Maybe next time.

984
01:00:48.806 --> 01:00:50.967
The wind must have
turned it around.


985
01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:56.944
Sorry if I interrupted
something back there.


986
01:00:57.015 --> 01:00:58.482
You flatter me, Doc.

987
01:01:06.024 --> 01:01:07.651
Something wrong?

988
01:01:07.725 --> 01:01:09.056
Naw.

989
01:01:11.462 --> 01:01:12.986
Nice hat, Doc.

990
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:20.228
Wish you fellas would
change your mind.


991
01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:21.397
Next time, Shorty.

992
01:01:29.881 --> 01:01:31.576
Hang on, Doc.

993
01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:34.277
I forgot something.
I'll be right back.


994
01:01:44.696 --> 01:01:45.958
Shorty?

995
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.624
Yo! Back here, Bob.

996
01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.998
Forget something?

997
01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:53.559
Yeah.

998
01:02:11.723 --> 01:02:14.283
If you're gonna try
to force money on me,


999
01:02:14.359 --> 01:02:17.260
you should know better
'cause I ain't accepting it.


1000
01:02:29.607 --> 01:02:30.904
What's the matter, Buddy?

1001
01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:40.311
When did he spot it?

1002
01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:43.081
20 minutes ago at a gas
station in Martinsberg.


1003
01:02:43.154 --> 01:02:45.452
The officer did not
know the car was hot.


1004
01:02:45.523 --> 01:02:47.184
He's going back right
now to investigate.


1005
01:02:47.258 --> 01:02:49.158
Do we have a description
of the driver?


1006
01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:53.755
Yes. White male, early

1007
01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:56.163
Matches one of our
unknowns from the motel.


1008
01:02:57.869 --> 01:03:01.202
And another thing, Buck..

1009
01:03:01.272 --> 01:03:02.864
they're here for him.

1010
01:03:05.576 --> 01:03:06.634
Ok.

1011
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.947
- Light's changed.

1012
01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:21.020
Yeah. I see it.

1013
01:03:26.697 --> 01:03:27.629
They're here.

1014
01:03:27.698 --> 01:03:30.326
Thank God.

1015
01:03:30.401 --> 01:03:32.460
Wait a minute, Frank.

1016
01:03:32.537 --> 01:03:33.902
Close the door.

1017
01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.138
Oh, my God, they're leavin'.

1018
01:03:44.449 --> 01:03:45.609
What's the story, deputy?

1019
01:03:48.019 --> 01:03:50.487
You said he'd be
here 15 minutes ago.


1020
01:03:50.555 --> 01:03:53.888
Well, you know, Buck's been
having some car trouble.


1021
01:03:53.958 --> 01:03:57.689
He's got a bad solenoid
on that starter.


1022
01:03:57.762 --> 01:03:59.753
I'll call him. I'll
call him right now.


1023
01:04:05.369 --> 01:04:07.200
Buck, what the hell
are you doing?


1024
01:04:07.271 --> 01:04:09.933
Don't ask any questions if you
don't want to hear the answer.


1025
01:04:10.007 --> 01:04:12.305
Buck, are you out of your mind?

1026
01:04:12.376 --> 01:04:13.934
You're messing with a
federal investigation here.


1027
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:15.706
That's called
obstruction of justice.


1028
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:17.907
I know exactly what it's called.

1029
01:04:17.982 --> 01:04:19.279
Get on the phone to the airport.

1030
01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:23.013
Tell them to have the chopper
standing by in 10 minutes.


1031
01:04:23.087 --> 01:04:24.452
A department helicopter?

1032
01:04:24.522 --> 01:04:26.956
And I want a car waiting
for him in Martinsberg.


1033
01:04:27.024 --> 01:04:31.017
Buck, McGinnis is going to
have a field day with this.


1034
01:04:31.095 --> 01:04:33.029
Even if you do win, he'll
have you impeached.


1035
01:04:33.097 --> 01:04:36.658
Well, I guess we can just consider
this my last official act.


1036
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.475
Colorado State Patrol says
they've got roadblocks


1037
01:04:45.543 --> 01:04:47.306
set up in a 200-mile radius.

1038
01:04:47.378 --> 01:04:51.144
Lot of snow up there right now.
Slow going.


1039
01:04:51.215 --> 01:04:53.376
Maybe you'll get lucky.

1040
01:04:56.687 --> 01:04:57.711
Thanks.

1041
01:05:04.962 --> 01:05:06.054
Buck?

1042
01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:08.428
Go find him, Frank.

1043
01:05:08.499 --> 01:05:10.467
Time's a wastin'.

1044
01:06:01.585 --> 01:06:03.519
Damn.

1045
01:06:05.889 --> 01:06:07.516
It's cold.

1046
01:06:07.591 --> 01:06:09.684
I know.

1047
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.024
Heater ain't working.
Radio, too.


1048
01:06:12.096 --> 01:06:14.621
Shorty must have blown a
fuse when he was working.


1049
01:06:17.434 --> 01:06:18.992
Where are we?

1050
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:20.502
My shortcut.

1051
01:06:20.571 --> 01:06:22.630
We'll skirt the storm this way.

1052
01:06:22.706 --> 01:06:24.196
Cut 2 hours off our time.

1053
01:06:30.114 --> 01:06:31.376
If we get there.

1054
01:06:31.448 --> 01:06:33.780
Trust me, Doc. Trust me.

1055
01:06:37.621 --> 01:06:40.249
Doc, while you were
sleepin', I was thinkin'..


1056
01:06:41.592 --> 01:06:46.427
and I've decided I have to
ask a great favor of you.


1057
01:06:46.497 --> 01:06:49.022
I have a son.

1058
01:06:49.099 --> 01:06:51.624
I'm not the best old
man he could have had,


1059
01:06:51.702 --> 01:06:53.602
but I do my best.

1060
01:06:53.671 --> 01:06:55.070
I have someone to
keep him for me.


1061
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.332
Where's his mother?

1062
01:06:58.409 --> 01:07:00.400
She's dead.

1063
01:07:00.477 --> 01:07:03.776
My sister keeps him.

1064
01:07:03.847 --> 01:07:05.405
Why are you telling me this?

1065
01:07:05.482 --> 01:07:06.915
I've been thinking about

1066
01:07:06.984 --> 01:07:08.451
if something happened to me,

1067
01:07:08.519 --> 01:07:09.747
he's got no one to look up to.

1068
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:12.288
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

1069
01:07:12.356 --> 01:07:14.517
I don't need you to
take care of him.


1070
01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:18.721
He needs somebody to sort
of be a godfather to him.


1071
01:07:18.796 --> 01:07:19.728
Be an example.

1072
01:07:19.797 --> 01:07:21.594
What, me?

1073
01:07:21.665 --> 01:07:22.689
You're smart, Doc.

1074
01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:24.427
Tough. Responsible.

1075
01:07:24.501 --> 01:07:27.834
Hard qualities to
find these days.


1076
01:07:27.905 --> 01:07:29.736
If something did happen to me,

1077
01:07:29.807 --> 01:07:31.331
I'd appreciate it if
you'd do that for me.


1078
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.644
Sure.

1079
01:07:34.712 --> 01:07:35.679
Thank you.

1080
01:07:35.746 --> 01:07:36.804
He lives in Oakland.

1081
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.475
8899 Todd Street.

1082
01:07:40.551 --> 01:07:42.451
Down near the bay.

1083
01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:44.612
You remember that address?

1084
01:07:44.688 --> 01:07:46.485
Uh, 8899 Todd.

1085
01:07:46.557 --> 01:07:49.549
Yeah. Thanks, Doc.

1086
01:07:49.626 --> 01:07:52.493
I feel better already.

1087
01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:03.133
Ahh.. yeah.

1088
01:08:03.207 --> 01:08:04.902
Just in time, huh?

1089
01:08:04.975 --> 01:08:06.875
Ha ha ha!

1090
01:08:06.944 --> 01:08:08.434
Whoa!

1091
01:08:08.512 --> 01:08:09.536
Hold on, Doc!

1092
01:08:10.614 --> 01:08:11.546
God damn it, get out!

1093
01:08:51.922 --> 01:08:53.014
Bob?

1094
01:08:58.562 --> 01:08:59.688
Bob!

1095
01:09:01.932 --> 01:09:03.923
Hey, Bob!

1096
01:09:04.001 --> 01:09:04.933
Yeah!

1097
01:09:05.002 --> 01:09:06.697
I'm here!

1098
01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:08.863
Don't come down here, Doc!

1099
01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:10.702
It's too dangerous!

1100
01:09:12.876 --> 01:09:15.208
My God.

1101
01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:16.610
Can you get out?

1102
01:09:17.681 --> 01:09:19.478
No! It's jammed!

1103
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:20.778
Then I'm coming down!

1104
01:09:20.851 --> 01:09:22.819
Stay up there!

1105
01:09:22.886 --> 01:09:24.319
One wrong move,

1106
01:09:24.388 --> 01:09:26.322
and they'll be digging both
our asses out in July.


1107
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:27.789
Hang on!

1108
01:09:27.858 --> 01:09:28.790
Oh.

1109
01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:31.327
God damn, you deaf
son of a bitch,


1110
01:09:31.395 --> 01:09:32.828
I said stay up there!

1111
01:09:32.896 --> 01:09:35.330
It's a little too late for that.

1112
01:09:38.635 --> 01:09:39.897
If we get out of this thing,

1113
01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:41.801
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of you for sure.


1114
01:09:41.872 --> 01:09:43.840
This ain't so bad.

1115
01:09:45.409 --> 01:09:48.003
Oh, no,
Mr. Ice-Water-In-The-Veins?


1116
01:09:51.415 --> 01:09:53.349
But now, since you're down here,

1117
01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:55.112
you might as well
get me out of this.


1118
01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.354
Uh, here..

1119
01:09:58.422 --> 01:10:00.481
Here, I got a better idea.

1120
01:10:07.264 --> 01:10:09.095
Be careful not to cut my pearls.

1121
01:10:12.002 --> 01:10:14.232
Real easy.

1122
01:10:15.339 --> 01:10:18.672
Don't want you cutting
the wrong thing.


1123
01:10:18.742 --> 01:10:22.405
God, I'm sure gonna
miss you girls.


1124
01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:24.811
Thank you, baby.

1125
01:10:24.882 --> 01:10:26.144
I'll see you later.

1126
01:10:26.216 --> 01:10:28.309
Let's get the hell out of here!

1127
01:10:33.156 --> 01:10:34.418
I gotcha.

1128
01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:35.423
Ahh.

1129
01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:36.459
Whoo!

1130
01:10:36.526 --> 01:10:38.323
Thanks, Doc.

1131
01:10:46.103 --> 01:10:48.333
I'm gonna still beat
the shit out of you.


1132
01:10:49.439 --> 01:10:50.997
Come on, let's git.

1133
01:10:52.075 --> 01:10:54.009
I hope you know where we are.

1134
01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:55.510
I sure do, partner.

1135
01:10:55.579 --> 01:10:56.841
I sure do.

1136
01:10:56.914 --> 01:10:59.109
Just a little stroll,

1137
01:10:59.182 --> 01:11:00.809
then a nice, warm bed.

1138
01:11:00.884 --> 01:11:01.873
Mmm!

1139
01:11:01.952 --> 01:11:05.046
I can smell that coffee
brewing right now.


1140
01:11:20.871 --> 01:11:22.805
Yeah, and some grits,

1141
01:11:22.873 --> 01:11:25.273
bacon, and some
biscuits and honey.


1142
01:11:25.342 --> 01:11:27.310
Yeah.

1143
01:11:27.377 --> 01:11:28.674
I'm telling you,

1144
01:11:28.745 --> 01:11:30.645
you're gonna like
this place, Doc.


1145
01:11:34.117 --> 01:11:36.381
What the hell?

1146
01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:41.314
Ah.

1147
01:11:45.262 --> 01:11:48.254
What the hell you think you
got, 9 lives or something?


1148
01:11:48.332 --> 01:11:49.799
Huh?

1149
01:12:13.256 --> 01:12:14.848
Whew.

1150
01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.351
Get on up here!

1151
01:12:19.429 --> 01:12:20.760
You think that's funny, huh?

1152
01:12:22.799 --> 01:12:24.460
Doc!

1153
01:12:34.077 --> 01:12:35.806
Bob!

1154
01:12:37.047 --> 01:12:38.036
Bob!

1155
01:12:49.359 --> 01:12:50.758
I got you, Doc.

1156
01:12:52.495 --> 01:12:53.860
Don't even think

1157
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:56.364
about trying to pull some
local strings here, sheriff.


1158
01:12:56.432 --> 01:13:00.334
I consider what you did to be a
serious obstruction of justice,


1159
01:13:00.403 --> 01:13:04.066
and I'm gonna make sure
you remember this stay.


1160
01:13:05.408 --> 01:13:07.342
Damn, Grant,

1161
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:10.902
you've got me quakin'
in my boots.


1162
01:13:23.192 --> 01:13:24.284
Mr. Lacrosse?

1163
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.292
Yes.

1164
01:13:25.361 --> 01:13:27.295
Captain Heber,
Colorado State Patrol.


1165
01:13:27.363 --> 01:13:30.730
I'm supposed to hold you till
your people get up here tomorrow.


1166
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.700
Mind if I have a look
around, captain?


1167
01:13:32.769 --> 01:13:34.634
Be my guest.

1168
01:13:38.274 --> 01:13:42.142
Victim's name was Clyde
"Shorty" Callahan.


1169
01:13:43.379 --> 01:13:45.313
No murder weapon was found.

1170
01:13:52.388 --> 01:13:54.219
Never even tried to pull it.

1171
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:56.588
We figure it was a blitz attack.

1172
01:13:56.659 --> 01:13:59.059
How else can you do that

1173
01:13:59.128 --> 01:14:02.063
to a man with a loaded .38?

1174
01:14:02.131 --> 01:14:04.361
Maybe he trusted him.

1175
01:14:11.407 --> 01:14:15.503
We still got roadblocks up on
routes 10, 160, and out on 350.


1176
01:14:15.578 --> 01:14:17.512
If he wanted to get
out of this valley,


1177
01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.480
he'd have to pass
through one of them.


1178
01:14:19.549 --> 01:14:21.779
I guarantee no Cadillac has.

1179
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:23.944
What about the roads through the
mountains, have they been checked?


1180
01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.282
Don't need to.

1181
01:14:25.354 --> 01:14:27.618
I can tell you right now
they're completely impassable.


1182
01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:29.123
Nothing going in or out.

1183
01:14:30.359 --> 01:14:32.293
You don't think he made
it past the roadblocks.


1184
01:14:32.361 --> 01:14:33.794
He's not in the mountains.

1185
01:14:33.863 --> 01:14:35.330
Where is he?

1186
01:14:35.398 --> 01:14:37.798
I didn't say he didn't get
through the roadblocks.


1187
01:14:37.867 --> 01:14:40.301
I said no Cadillac
like that has.


1188
01:14:40.369 --> 01:14:42.303
I got a report that says

1189
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:46.137
there's over 200 stranded
vehicles on l-25 alone.


1190
01:14:47.376 --> 01:14:49.810
And that's just between
here and Pueblo.


1191
01:14:49.879 --> 01:14:52.814
If he were heading to Alamosa,

1192
01:14:52.882 --> 01:14:54.816
the weather's worse.

1193
01:14:54.884 --> 01:14:58.376
I think when we start digging
all those vehicles out,


1194
01:14:58.454 --> 01:15:01.753
we're gonna find us
one white Cadillac.


1195
01:15:05.895 --> 01:15:08.659
Kinda got ahead of
himself, didn't he?


1196
01:15:08.731 --> 01:15:10.824
Not even the 17th.

1197
01:15:18.241 --> 01:15:20.266
I asked Ruth to
hold a room for you


1198
01:15:20.343 --> 01:15:22.777
over at the railroad
maintenance dorm


1199
01:15:22.845 --> 01:15:24.278
over by the tracks.

1200
01:15:24.347 --> 01:15:25.939
It's the only place in town.

1201
01:15:26.015 --> 01:15:28.279
I thought you were
supposed to hold me.


1202
01:15:28.351 --> 01:15:30.785
Well, it's 20 miles to
the nearest lockup,


1203
01:15:30.853 --> 01:15:33.287
and I figure if the
killer can't get out,


1204
01:15:33.356 --> 01:15:34.789
you can't either.

1205
01:15:34.857 --> 01:15:36.290
Thanks, captain.

1206
01:15:36.359 --> 01:15:37.792
Don't thank me.

1207
01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.293
Thank Buck Olmstead.

1208
01:15:39.362 --> 01:15:41.796
Damn shame about that election.

1209
01:15:41.864 --> 01:15:44.298
Won't be the same without him.

1210
01:15:49.872 --> 01:15:50.804
Howdy.

1211
01:15:50.873 --> 01:15:51.805
Good evening.

1212
01:15:51.874 --> 01:15:53.307
You Mr. Lacrosse?

1213
01:15:53.376 --> 01:15:54.308
Yes.

1214
01:15:54.377 --> 01:15:56.311
Sign in here, please.

1215
01:16:00.383 --> 01:16:02.817
Terrible thing, that murder.

1216
01:16:04.387 --> 01:16:06.821
You know, I used to
baby-sit for Shorty


1217
01:16:06.889 --> 01:16:09.323
when he was just a little fella.

1218
01:16:09.392 --> 01:16:10.825
I can't believe it.

1219
01:16:16.065 --> 01:16:17.293
Good night, Ruth.

1220
01:16:17.366 --> 01:16:18.298
See ya, Bill.

1221
01:16:18.367 --> 01:16:19.994
You be careful up there now.

1222
01:16:20.069 --> 01:16:21.195
You betcha.

1223
01:16:22.338 --> 01:16:24.272
Shorty used to do that.

1224
01:16:25.341 --> 01:16:26.535
What's that?

1225
01:16:26.609 --> 01:16:28.270
Clear the passes.

1226
01:16:28.344 --> 01:16:30.278
His wife made him give it up

1227
01:16:30.346 --> 01:16:32.280
on account it was too dangerous.

1228
01:16:32.348 --> 01:16:33.975
That's irony, isn't it?

1229
01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:36.712
He gave up clearing the passes

1230
01:16:36.786 --> 01:16:38.117
'cause it was too dangerous.

1231
01:16:38.187 --> 01:16:41.054
Then he gets hisself
killed in his own garage.


1232
01:16:45.428 --> 01:16:46.759
Well, here's your key.

1233
01:16:46.829 --> 01:16:49.297
The room is out the
door to the right.


1234
01:16:57.373 --> 01:16:59.307
Here you go, Bob.

1235
01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:01.309
Nice.

1236
01:17:01.377 --> 01:17:03.311
Yeah.

1237
01:17:05.881 --> 01:17:07.849
Where is everyone, Al?

1238
01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:10.317
I thought this place
would be packed.


1239
01:17:10.386 --> 01:17:12.820
Well, you can't get in,

1240
01:17:12.888 --> 01:17:14.822
and nobody's getting out,

1241
01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:16.323
so it ain't packed.

1242
01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.994
How'd you all get in
to La Veta, anyway?


1243
01:17:20.062 --> 01:17:21.256
Ah, we hoofed it.

1244
01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.264
Little car trouble
up on the mountain.


1245
01:17:23.332 --> 01:17:25.664
You guys are really lucky.

1246
01:17:25.735 --> 01:17:26.759
Yeah.

1247
01:17:28.838 --> 01:17:31.329
Don't look like he
held up to well.


1248
01:17:32.508 --> 01:17:35.238
He did better than you think.

1249
01:18:16.018 --> 01:18:18.213
Wonderful, Robby.

1250
01:18:21.724 --> 01:18:23.658
Tell Sally it was delicious.

1251
01:18:23.726 --> 01:18:24.818
Will do, sheriff.

1252
01:18:24.894 --> 01:18:27.328
I brought that little
something you asked for.


1253
01:18:27.396 --> 01:18:29.330
Oh, thank you.

1254
01:18:30.433 --> 01:18:32.230
I'll get you a glass.

1255
01:18:33.402 --> 01:18:36.337
Make it 2, will ya, Robby?

1256
01:18:38.074 --> 01:18:40.872
Well, I see you've adjusted
well to your new situation.


1257
01:18:42.411 --> 01:18:45.346
Care to join the recently
unemployed in a drink?


1258
01:18:49.418 --> 01:18:52.353
Don't be so down, Nate.

1259
01:18:52.421 --> 01:18:54.218
It's not your fault.

1260
01:18:55.691 --> 01:18:58.353
I just can't help
thinking that..


1261
01:18:58.427 --> 01:19:00.861
maybe we should have
made that announcement.


1262
01:19:00.930 --> 01:19:01.919
Maybe.

1263
01:19:01.997 --> 01:19:04.932
Or maybe if he'd
killed in Midland


1264
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.366
instead of Amarillo..

1265
01:19:07.436 --> 01:19:09.199
or..

1266
01:19:09.271 --> 01:19:11.967
if Saldez would have had
his little shoot-'em-up


1267
01:19:12.041 --> 01:19:14.441
in our jurisdiction
instead of McGinnis'..


1268
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:15.738
Who knows?

1269
01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:17.403
Maybe we should
have turned him in.


1270
01:19:18.948 --> 01:19:21.781
Maybe we should've done a
lot of things differently.


1271
01:19:25.454 --> 01:19:28.423
But turning Frank in
was never an option.


1272
01:19:30.559 --> 01:19:31.821
Why not?

1273
01:19:31.894 --> 01:19:33.486
'Cause he told the truth.

1274
01:19:33.562 --> 01:19:35.325
Once you've heard the truth,

1275
01:19:35.397 --> 01:19:38.298
everything else is
just cheap whiskey.


1276
01:19:50.412 --> 01:19:52.676
I might have settled for it.

1277
01:19:55.918 --> 01:19:57.852
No, you wouldn't.

1278
01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.945
You're a good policeman, Nate.

1279
01:20:00.022 --> 01:20:02.957
You're gonna do just
fine with Jack.


1280
01:20:03.025 --> 01:20:06.324
Now you go on home and
hug those children.


1281
01:20:06.395 --> 01:20:08.363
Give that pretty
wife of yours a kiss


1282
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:10.762
and know that what you've
done was the right thing.


1283
01:20:13.435 --> 01:20:14.868
What about you, Buck?

1284
01:20:14.937 --> 01:20:15.995
Me?

1285
01:20:16.071 --> 01:20:18.369
Well, as you can see,

1286
01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.967
this whole experience
has just devastated me.


1287
01:20:26.048 --> 01:20:27.481
Good night, sheriff.

1288
01:20:33.889 --> 01:20:35.550
Bob, good to see ya.

1289
01:20:35.624 --> 01:20:36.818
You, too, Hank.

1290
01:20:36.892 --> 01:20:38.018
Hey, Bob.

1291
01:20:38.093 --> 01:20:39.025
Hey, Tate.

1292
01:20:39.094 --> 01:20:40.527
What's news, Cubby?

1293
01:20:40.596 --> 01:20:43.326
Cubby: Someone got killed
over in Martinsberg.


1294
01:20:43.399 --> 01:20:45.833
They think it might be the
same guy from Amarillo?


1295
01:20:45.901 --> 01:20:47.664
If they do, they ain't saying?

1296
01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:50.204
State Patrol say they're
looking for a young fella.


1297
01:20:50.272 --> 01:20:52.137
You boys seem to be
up on all the news.


1298
01:20:52.208 --> 01:20:53.368
Well, hell,

1299
01:20:53.442 --> 01:20:56.343
we been stuck here since
the day before yesterday.


1300
01:20:56.412 --> 01:20:58.573
Haven't done anything
but watch TV.


1301
01:20:58.647 --> 01:21:00.342
Well, then..

1302
01:21:00.416 --> 01:21:03.385
it's time we get that pass
opened up and move on.


1303
01:21:03.452 --> 01:21:06.387
Well, they're gonna
send a crew up tonight.


1304
01:21:06.455 --> 01:21:08.355
You're more than welcome
to go with them.


1305
01:21:08.424 --> 01:21:10.358
Be like old times.

1306
01:21:10.426 --> 01:21:12.360
In my youth, friend.
In my youth.


1307
01:21:14.163 --> 01:21:15.687
Thank you, Hank.

1308
01:21:15.764 --> 01:21:17.163
Now, what's your rush?

1309
01:21:17.233 --> 01:21:18.666
Uh, you see,

1310
01:21:18.734 --> 01:21:22.295
the lack of female
clientele disturbs me.


1311
01:21:27.710 --> 01:21:30.304
Uh, by the way, Tate,

1312
01:21:30.379 --> 01:21:32.779
you hear anything about the 218?

1313
01:21:32.848 --> 01:21:33.780
Martinsberg?

1314
01:21:33.849 --> 01:21:35.680
Last I heard, it's going up.

1315
01:21:35.751 --> 01:21:37.687
But it don't come here.
You know that.


1316
01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.311
Just asking.

1317
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:30.964
Well, they got the pass open.

1318
01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:34.467
Don't worry.

1319
01:22:34.543 --> 01:22:37.307
The 218's the only
train till tomorrow.


1320
01:26:06.088 --> 01:26:07.521
Pass is clear, boys.

1321
01:26:07.589 --> 01:26:09.318
Got the word the pass is clear.

1322
01:26:09.391 --> 01:26:10.858
All right. Thank you.

1323
01:26:22.338 --> 01:26:24.272
You ready to go?

1324
01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:27.275
You're full of shit, Joe,
you know that, right?


1325
01:26:27.343 --> 01:26:29.277
I know what I'm talking about.

1326
01:26:29.345 --> 01:26:31.279
A Cadillac. I know
what a Cadillac is.


1327
01:26:31.347 --> 01:26:33.372
Filled with pictures
of naked women, right?


1328
01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:35.940
That's what I said.

1329
01:26:36.018 --> 01:26:37.451
Uh-huh.

1330
01:26:40.689 --> 01:26:42.418
I heard it on the radio.

1331
01:26:42.491 --> 01:26:44.686
What about that car?

1332
01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.284
You heard it, too?

1333
01:26:46.362 --> 01:26:48.762
Tell this guy it's
the truth, will ya?


1334
01:26:48.831 --> 01:26:52.164
It's the car that the killer in
Amarillo was driving, wasn't it?


1335
01:26:52.234 --> 01:26:54.532
See? He knows.

1336
01:26:56.372 --> 01:26:58.363
Hey, stranger.

1337
01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.908
How about this for a day?

1338
01:27:00.976 --> 01:27:03.342
They sent a plow to the pass
last night and had some luck.


1339
01:27:03.412 --> 01:27:06.472
We got about 30 minutes
before the train leaves.


1340
01:27:10.019 --> 01:27:11.452
You feeling all right, Doc?

1341
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.317
Yeah, I'm fine.

1342
01:27:13.389 --> 01:27:15.653
I'm just, uh..

1343
01:27:15.724 --> 01:27:18.022
just a little tired here.

1344
01:27:18.093 --> 01:27:19.321
Sleep ok?

1345
01:27:19.395 --> 01:27:20.259
Yeah.

1346
01:27:21.897 --> 01:27:24.889
Thought maybe you heard the police
were looking for a car like mine.


1347
01:27:26.835 --> 01:27:28.268
White Cadillac.

1348
01:27:30.005 --> 01:27:31.563
Yeah, I did.

1349
01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.768
Well, that car that they're
looking for had Texas plates.


1350
01:27:34.843 --> 01:27:36.902
Mine had Oklahoma
tags, remember?


1351
01:27:36.979 --> 01:27:38.776
Uh, yeah.

1352
01:27:38.847 --> 01:27:40.212
That's right.

1353
01:27:40.282 --> 01:27:41.943
You do believe me, don't you?

1354
01:27:42.017 --> 01:27:44.577
Yeah. It's just, uh, it's crazy.

1355
01:27:44.653 --> 01:27:47.622
It just took me by surprise.

1356
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:49.554
You? How about me?

1357
01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:54.288
Well, I'm going downstairs
to catch the weather.


1358
01:27:54.363 --> 01:27:57.196
Throw on your clothes, and we'll
grab a bite before we go.


1359
01:27:57.266 --> 01:27:58.198
Ok.

1360
01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:06.764
Female Weathercaster:
Frigid temperatures continue
to blow in from the northwest,


1361
01:28:06.842 --> 01:28:09.811
and it looks like we won't
even reach the 32-degree mark


1362
01:28:09.878 --> 01:28:11.812
until sometime this weekend.

1363
01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.814
Man On Television: At
Cherry Creek Dodge,


1364
01:28:13.882 --> 01:28:16.316
we've been steering you right
with great deals for 16 years.


1365
01:28:16.384 --> 01:28:18.318
Now we've put special
anniversary sale prices


1366
01:28:18.386 --> 01:28:20.149
on every car, truck, and van..

1367
01:28:22.891 --> 01:28:25.587
Hey, Doc. Ready?

1368
01:28:29.564 --> 01:28:31.498
Where did you get that car?

1369
01:28:36.738 --> 01:28:39.206
Look, Doc, I can
understand your concerns,


1370
01:28:39.274 --> 01:28:40.832
but you ever stop to think

1371
01:28:40.909 --> 01:28:42.809
about how many white
Caddies there probably are


1372
01:28:42.878 --> 01:28:44.709
in the great state of Texas?

1373
01:28:44.779 --> 01:28:46.371
Probably a lot.

1374
01:28:46.448 --> 01:28:48.143
I'd say more than that.

1375
01:28:48.216 --> 01:28:50.241
But not that many with pictures.

1376
01:28:52.521 --> 01:28:53.920
Where'd you get the car?

1377
01:28:57.092 --> 01:28:58.719
Well, I lied to you.

1378
01:29:00.095 --> 01:29:02.120
I wasn't taking it to no one.

1379
01:29:02.197 --> 01:29:04.358
It's my car.

1380
01:29:04.432 --> 01:29:06.866
Bought it in Tulsa the day
before I picked you up,


1381
01:29:06.935 --> 01:29:08.869
but that doesn't mean
I killed anyone.


1382
01:29:08.937 --> 01:29:10.871
Stop right there.

1383
01:29:10.939 --> 01:29:13.373
I told you it was a friend's

1384
01:29:13.441 --> 01:29:16.877
because I figured you'd feel too
uncomfortable if you thought it
was mine.


1385
01:29:16.945 --> 01:29:18.537
And I was right, wasn't I?

1386
01:29:19.614 --> 01:29:21.047
Wasn't I?

1387
01:29:21.116 --> 01:29:23.846
I was gonna throw all those pictures
out when I got to Salt Lake.


1388
01:29:23.919 --> 01:29:26.217
They were a hoot,
though, weren't they?


1389
01:29:26.288 --> 01:29:27.448
Those pictures?

1390
01:29:29.891 --> 01:29:31.324
Doc..

1391
01:29:31.393 --> 01:29:33.327
if I killed those people..

1392
01:29:33.395 --> 01:29:34.987
why would I travel in that car?

1393
01:29:35.063 --> 01:29:36.553
Don't come any closer.

1394
01:29:36.631 --> 01:29:39.327
If I was the killer,

1395
01:29:39.401 --> 01:29:41.767
would I take you to all the
places where I'm known,


1396
01:29:41.836 --> 01:29:43.326
introduce you to my friends,

1397
01:29:43.405 --> 01:29:45.168
hell, even save your neck?

1398
01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.764
I mean it!

1399
01:29:46.841 --> 01:29:48.672
If I was the killer,
why didn't I kill you?


1400
01:29:48.743 --> 01:29:50.870
I had plenty of chances.

1401
01:29:52.414 --> 01:29:54.006
God damn it!

1402
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:57.409
It was my car!

1403
01:29:57.485 --> 01:29:58.417
Prove it!

1404
01:29:58.486 --> 01:30:00.249
With what?!

1405
01:30:00.322 --> 01:30:01.846
I got off a train

1406
01:30:01.923 --> 01:30:04.357
and bought it off a
fella for 500 bucks!


1407
01:30:04.426 --> 01:30:06.360
I knew it wasn't
on the up and up


1408
01:30:06.428 --> 01:30:07.861
because of the price.

1409
01:30:07.929 --> 01:30:09.794
What did you expect me to do,

1410
01:30:09.864 --> 01:30:11.263
ask him for a receipt?

1411
01:30:12.601 --> 01:30:14.466
That is the truth!

1412
01:30:14.536 --> 01:30:16.367
And if you can't trust me,

1413
01:30:16.438 --> 01:30:18.872
then turn me in,

1414
01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.636
'cause all I got is my word.

1415
01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:23.143
In Amarillo today,

1416
01:30:23.211 --> 01:30:25.304
police officials have announced

1417
01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.245
that the key suspect
has been booked


1418
01:30:27.315 --> 01:30:30.250
for the murders of 3
people there Friday.


1419
01:30:30.318 --> 01:30:33.310
Amarillo City Police
Chief Jack McGinnis


1420
01:30:33.388 --> 01:30:34.821
praised investigators

1421
01:30:34.889 --> 01:30:36.823
for the arrest of Hector Saldez.

1422
01:30:36.891 --> 01:30:39.155
I want to thank the
combined efforts


1423
01:30:39.227 --> 01:30:41.161
of the city police and
forensic departments


1424
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:42.662
for the arrest of this killer.

1425
01:30:42.731 --> 01:30:44.824
The suspect's name
is Hector Saldez.


1426
01:30:44.899 --> 01:30:47.834
Mr. Saldez has been wanted
in New Mexico and Oklahoma


1427
01:30:47.902 --> 01:30:49.335
on assault charges.

1428
01:30:49.404 --> 01:30:51.338
Now, both of these states
have waived extradition


1429
01:30:51.406 --> 01:30:53.340
so that we may proceed
with the prosecution.


1430
01:30:53.408 --> 01:30:54.932
Chief, do these murders

1431
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:56.944
have anything to do with the
murder in Colorado yesterday?


1432
01:30:57.012 --> 01:30:58.980
Well, I can't comment
on their investigation.


1433
01:30:59.047 --> 01:31:00.674
Chief McGinnis would not comment

1434
01:31:00.749 --> 01:31:02.842
on whether there
was any connection


1435
01:31:02.917 --> 01:31:05.579
between the slayings in Texas
and a recent murder in..


1436
01:31:05.654 --> 01:31:06.916
Just an accident, Al.

1437
01:31:06.988 --> 01:31:09.422
Nothing to get all
excited about.


1438
01:31:09.491 --> 01:31:10.515
Ah.

1439
01:31:10.592 --> 01:31:13.356
Let me know what we
owe you for damages.


1440
01:31:22.937 --> 01:31:24.199
What?

1441
01:31:24.272 --> 01:31:25.637
Colorado State
Patrol found his car


1442
01:31:25.707 --> 01:31:28.301
in a stream near a
railroad trestle.


1443
01:31:28.376 --> 01:31:30.936
Seems he lost control
while chasing a train.


1444
01:31:31.012 --> 01:31:32.843
They're looking
for his body now.


1445
01:31:32.914 --> 01:31:34.313
A train?

1446
01:31:34.382 --> 01:31:36.316
Yeah, a Rio Grande freight.

1447
01:31:36.384 --> 01:31:38.318
The 218.

1448
01:31:38.386 --> 01:31:40.320
218?

1449
01:31:40.388 --> 01:31:42.481
It wasn't a date.

1450
01:31:43.558 --> 01:31:44.991
He set him up.

1451
01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.358
We've gotta get in
touch with that train.


1452
01:31:47.429 --> 01:31:49.829
Can't. They're out of contact
till it gets to the other side.


1453
01:31:49.898 --> 01:31:51.729
Storm's knocked out
telephone transmission.


1454
01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.290
How long?

1455
01:31:53.368 --> 01:31:54.995
5 hours.

1456
01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:56.833
5 hours.

1457
01:31:56.905 --> 01:31:59.339
He knew Frank wouldn't give up,

1458
01:31:59.407 --> 01:32:01.034
so he sucked him in.

1459
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:02.542
Are you saying

1460
01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:05.875
that the killer was
expecting him to be there?


1461
01:32:05.947 --> 01:32:08.677
And I helped deliver him.

1462
01:32:27.769 --> 01:32:29.202
Who are you?

1463
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:30.430
Ray Calabrese.

1464
01:32:30.505 --> 01:32:32.302
Don't shoot me.

1465
01:32:32.374 --> 01:32:33.807
Please.

1466
01:32:37.379 --> 01:32:39.040
How'd you lose your shoe?

1467
01:32:39.114 --> 01:32:41.309
Getting on the train.

1468
01:32:41.383 --> 01:32:43.317
How'd you get here?

1469
01:32:43.385 --> 01:32:46.479
I was with that crew that cleared
La Veta pass last night.


1470
01:32:46.554 --> 01:32:49.819
Everyone else went back down
to Martinsberg with the plow.


1471
01:32:49.891 --> 01:32:51.324
I live in Salida,

1472
01:32:51.393 --> 01:32:53.327
on the other side of the pass.

1473
01:32:53.395 --> 01:32:55.329
218 picks me up here,
takes me home.


1474
01:32:56.898 --> 01:32:58.661
When's the next one due over?

1475
01:32:58.733 --> 01:33:00.132
This is it for the day.

1476
01:33:00.201 --> 01:33:01.634
No, that's not possible.

1477
01:33:01.703 --> 01:33:02.829
There's gotta be another one.

1478
01:33:02.904 --> 01:33:04.838
Not unless you wanted
to climb the hill


1479
01:33:04.906 --> 01:33:06.897
to the upper grade
at Understanding,


1480
01:33:06.975 --> 01:33:08.408
catch the 20-10.

1481
01:33:08.476 --> 01:33:10.239
There are 2 lines
through the pass.


1482
01:33:10.311 --> 01:33:11.801
The upper grade is on the
other side of the hill.


1483
01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.438
What's Understanding, a town?

1484
01:33:13.515 --> 01:33:15.449
No, man.

1485
01:33:16.618 --> 01:33:19.348
It's a railroad siding.

1486
01:33:26.161 --> 01:33:27.287
When's it come through?

1487
01:33:27.362 --> 01:33:29.296
The 20-10? In about an hour.

1488
01:33:31.366 --> 01:33:33.459
You can't go up there like that.

1489
01:33:33.535 --> 01:33:34.763
Watch me.

1490
01:33:35.837 --> 01:33:36.769
Wait.

1491
01:33:53.888 --> 01:33:55.822
What do I owe you?

1492
01:33:58.893 --> 01:34:00.622
Bill's already been settled.

1493
01:34:00.695 --> 01:34:02.322
Bob paid it.

1494
01:34:02.397 --> 01:34:03.659
You know where I can find him?

1495
01:34:03.731 --> 01:34:05.323
Over at the freight office.

1496
01:34:10.405 --> 01:34:12.498
Sorry.

1497
01:34:22.183 --> 01:34:23.775
Right then. I'm on my way.

1498
01:34:23.852 --> 01:34:24.784
Bye.

1499
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:37.657
Can I talk to you?

1500
01:34:48.376 --> 01:34:49.809
I'm sorry.

1501
01:34:51.045 --> 01:34:52.706
I'm sorry I doubted you.

1502
01:34:54.716 --> 01:34:57.310
Doc, if I had been
in your shoes,


1503
01:34:57.385 --> 01:34:59.319
hearing what you heard,

1504
01:34:59.387 --> 01:35:01.321
I'd have probably held
a gun on me, too.


1505
01:35:05.393 --> 01:35:07.384
If the offer's still open, uh,

1506
01:35:07.462 --> 01:35:09.828
I'm going over with you.

1507
01:35:15.403 --> 01:35:17.871
Glad to have you, partner.

1508
01:35:17.939 --> 01:35:19.338
Bobby!

1509
01:35:19.407 --> 01:35:21.739
- Hey!
- Hey!


1510
01:35:21.809 --> 01:35:23.777
How you doing, Buddy?

1511
01:35:23.845 --> 01:35:25.107
Oh, God.

1512
01:35:25.179 --> 01:35:26.111
Hey, Doc!

1513
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:27.408
This crusty old thing here..

1514
01:35:27.482 --> 01:35:28.414
Oh, welcome! Welcome!

1515
01:35:28.483 --> 01:35:29.780
..is Tex Monroe.

1516
01:35:29.851 --> 01:35:31.284
Climb aboard.

1517
01:35:31.352 --> 01:35:34.185
I'll tell ya, any friend of
this man is a friend of mine.


1518
01:35:34.255 --> 01:35:36.280
Come on. I got a lot to
tell ya about Bobby.


1519
01:35:36.357 --> 01:35:37.790
Come on in here.

1520
01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.294
Now, if you won't help him,

1521
01:35:41.362 --> 01:35:43.125
let me out of here, and I will.

1522
01:35:43.197 --> 01:35:45.290
You've helped the
FBI enough already,


1523
01:35:45.366 --> 01:35:47.561
don't you think?

1524
01:35:47.635 --> 01:35:49.296
My God, man.

1525
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:51.804
He's trying to find his son.

1526
01:35:51.873 --> 01:35:53.636
It's a pipe dream, sheriff.

1527
01:36:00.148 --> 01:36:01.445
Jack.

1528
01:36:04.886 --> 01:36:06.911
I need your help here, Jack.

1529
01:36:08.222 --> 01:36:10.816
I wish I could help you, Buck,

1530
01:36:10.892 --> 01:36:12.257
but..

1531
01:36:13.328 --> 01:36:14.761
It's a federal thing.

1532
01:36:14.829 --> 01:36:16.820
By the time it would take
me to get a hearing..


1533
01:36:16.898 --> 01:36:19.366
I don't need a hearing. I
need you to turn the key.


1534
01:36:20.969 --> 01:36:22.300
Christ, Buck.

1535
01:36:24.839 --> 01:36:27.000
This is the last thing I
need on the first day.


1536
01:36:27.075 --> 01:36:28.906
Yes, it is.

1537
01:36:36.517 --> 01:36:37.984
Open the door.

1538
01:36:39.053 --> 01:36:41.453
You're off to a
good start, Jack.


1539
01:36:42.523 --> 01:36:44.218
Anything else you need?

1540
01:36:47.862 --> 01:36:51.298
Well, as a matter of fact..

1541
01:36:51.366 --> 01:36:52.333
there is.

1542
01:37:13.621 --> 01:37:17.113
Yep, we're getting up
close to the pass.


1543
01:37:17.192 --> 01:37:21.492
Trains still get swept
away in slides up here.


1544
01:37:21.563 --> 01:37:24.259
Careful what you
touch up there, Doc.


1545
01:37:24.332 --> 01:37:26.926
Yes siree. Those levers control
them big 4-ton wings out there.


1546
01:37:27.001 --> 01:37:28.764
You send one out by accident..

1547
01:37:30.538 --> 01:37:33.200
Have just a little bit of trouble
getting through the next tunnel.


1548
01:37:33.274 --> 01:37:35.139
What gives them power?

1549
01:37:35.210 --> 01:37:37.474
Them big air tanks in
the main compartment.


1550
01:37:37.545 --> 01:37:39.240
This always been your
job, working this thing?


1551
01:37:39.314 --> 01:37:40.747
Aw, no, no.

1552
01:37:40.815 --> 01:37:43.283
I just a-haulin' this
spreader over to Alamosa.


1553
01:37:43.351 --> 01:37:45.319
Clearing passes ain't
a job I cotton to.


1554
01:37:45.386 --> 01:37:46.785
Night work, mostly.

1555
01:37:46.855 --> 01:37:48.982
Cold. Oh, God.

1556
01:37:49.057 --> 01:37:52.424
Bobby, he used to clear these
passes up here, though.


1557
01:37:52.494 --> 01:37:53.927
Long time ago, Tex.

1558
01:37:53.995 --> 01:37:55.189
Long time ago.

1559
01:38:26.227 --> 01:38:27.387
Oh.

1560
01:38:28.763 --> 01:38:30.492
Aah! Aah!

1561
01:38:39.741 --> 01:38:41.174
Anybody got a light?

1562
01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:53.785
Well, I'll be damned.

1563
01:38:53.855 --> 01:38:56.346
This is the place..

1564
01:38:56.424 --> 01:38:58.654
where them murders
were in Amarillo.


1565
01:38:58.726 --> 01:39:00.921
The motel in Amarillo.

1566
01:39:00.995 --> 01:39:02.792
Been on the news for 2 days.

1567
01:39:04.832 --> 01:39:06.857
Did I say something?

1568
01:39:07.936 --> 01:39:09.528
Yeah, Tex, you did.

1569
01:39:14.108 --> 01:39:16.008
Hope I didn't say nothin' bad.

1570
01:39:16.077 --> 01:39:17.908
Nothing bad, Tex.

1571
01:39:17.979 --> 01:39:19.378
It's just ol' Doc over there

1572
01:39:19.447 --> 01:39:21.210
has got me pegged as a
killer right about now.


1573
01:39:21.282 --> 01:39:22.306
What?

1574
01:39:22.383 --> 01:39:24.817
Where'd you get a crazy
thought like that?


1575
01:39:24.886 --> 01:39:27.980
Why, they're looking for some
young fella with brown hair..


1576
01:39:28.056 --> 01:39:29.523
sorta like yours. Jeez.

1577
01:39:29.591 --> 01:39:32.321
This here man..

1578
01:39:32.393 --> 01:39:33.690
is the salt of the Earth.

1579
01:39:33.761 --> 01:39:36.321
The salt of the Earth.

1580
01:39:37.699 --> 01:39:39.792
Stay right there, Doc.

1581
01:39:40.969 --> 01:39:42.630
Oh, my God.

1582
01:39:42.704 --> 01:39:44.171
Let me help him.

1583
01:39:44.238 --> 01:39:45.830
It's too late.

1584
01:39:45.907 --> 01:39:47.431
There's nothing you can do.

1585
01:39:55.416 --> 01:39:56.940
Aah!

1586
01:39:57.018 --> 01:39:58.383
Bring that pack down here.

1587
01:39:58.453 --> 01:40:00.944
I'll take the gun.

1588
01:40:05.426 --> 01:40:07.360
Relax, Doc.

1589
01:40:15.403 --> 01:40:17.371
You followed me from the motel.

1590
01:40:17.438 --> 01:40:19.872
Actually, from the night before.

1591
01:40:19.941 --> 01:40:21.408
I watched you check in.

1592
01:40:21.476 --> 01:40:23.307
The motel was full,

1593
01:40:23.378 --> 01:40:25.107
so you shared a room
with that fella.


1594
01:40:27.215 --> 01:40:28.648
I didn't stay.

1595
01:40:29.884 --> 01:40:32.352
I was car shopping that night.

1596
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:37.319
But by the time you came over

1597
01:40:37.392 --> 01:40:39.519
for breakfast the next morning,

1598
01:40:39.594 --> 01:40:40.822
I was back.

1599
01:40:42.397 --> 01:40:44.331
I heard you ask for a ride.

1600
01:40:47.902 --> 01:40:51.338
Then I paid your friend
Mr. Sutherland a visit.


1601
01:40:54.909 --> 01:40:56.672
It was a quick visit.

1602
01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.293
They'll find you.

1603
01:41:14.362 --> 01:41:16.353
I don't think so.

1604
01:41:16.431 --> 01:41:18.194
Like Tex said,

1605
01:41:18.266 --> 01:41:19.756
they ain't lookin' for me.

1606
01:41:25.873 --> 01:41:27.170
Where's the gun?

1607
01:41:33.648 --> 01:41:35.639
Oh.

1608
01:41:54.168 --> 01:41:56.102
Freeze.

1609
01:41:57.505 --> 01:41:59.405
I didn't do it.

1610
01:41:59.474 --> 01:42:01.101
Get away from him.

1611
01:42:04.645 --> 01:42:06.135
Look, it was him.

1612
01:42:06.214 --> 01:42:09.581
He's the one who did it. He's the
one who killed him. I didn't do it.


1613
01:42:09.650 --> 01:42:11.083
Where is he?!

1614
01:42:11.152 --> 01:42:13.017
What? Who?

1615
01:42:13.087 --> 01:42:14.850
I will kill you to find him.

1616
01:42:14.922 --> 01:42:16.753
I don't know what
you're talking about.


1617
01:42:16.824 --> 01:42:18.155
Look out!

1618
01:42:21.362 --> 01:42:22.659
Aah.

1619
01:42:31.873 --> 01:42:33.568
You made good time, Frank.

1620
01:42:34.675 --> 01:42:35.835
I have to admit,

1621
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:37.969
I was worried for awhile
that you'd make it at all.


1622
01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.814
Drop the gun so we
can talk civilized.


1623
01:42:41.883 --> 01:42:44.317
State Patrol knows
I'm on this train.


1624
01:42:44.385 --> 01:42:46.319
They know you're on it.

1625
01:42:46.387 --> 01:42:48.685
They'll be waiting
on the other side.


1626
01:42:49.891 --> 01:42:52.155
Always needing help,
aren't you, Frank?


1627
01:42:52.226 --> 01:42:54.194
You didn't start out that way.

1628
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:57.763
In the beginning,

1629
01:42:57.832 --> 01:42:59.629
when it was just me and you,

1630
01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.133
it was a challenge.

1631
01:43:01.202 --> 01:43:02.829
I'd make a move,

1632
01:43:02.904 --> 01:43:04.872
then you'd make a move.

1633
01:43:04.939 --> 01:43:06.964
Then you have to start
playing the game unfairly.


1634
01:43:07.041 --> 01:43:08.838
It never was a game.

1635
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:10.844
Oh, yes, it was.

1636
01:43:10.912 --> 01:43:12.743
Me against you.

1637
01:43:12.814 --> 01:43:15.339
Then it was me against
you and 50 other agents.


1638
01:43:15.416 --> 01:43:16.678
Then 200 agents.

1639
01:43:16.751 --> 01:43:18.343
You never seemed to
have any trouble.


1640
01:43:18.419 --> 01:43:21.286
Hey, don't bullshit me, Frank.

1641
01:43:21.355 --> 01:43:25.291
So I had to level
the playing field.


1642
01:43:25.359 --> 01:43:26.849
That's why I took your boy.

1643
01:43:26.928 --> 01:43:28.293
Where is he?

1644
01:43:28.362 --> 01:43:30.296
Remember the deal?

1645
01:43:30.364 --> 01:43:32.229
Kill me to find him.

1646
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:44.807
You had your chance, Frank!

1647
01:43:44.879 --> 01:43:46.676
You should have taken it!

1648
01:43:50.084 --> 01:43:51.210
Bye, Frank!

1649
01:44:03.398 --> 01:44:04.831
Don't talk.

1650
01:44:25.853 --> 01:44:27.115
Rest.

1651
01:44:44.238 --> 01:44:45.227
Aah!

1652
01:44:48.576 --> 01:44:50.373
Aah!

1653
01:44:54.882 --> 01:44:58.579
Southern Pacific, this is
Denver dispatch. You read me?


1654
01:45:05.994 --> 01:45:06.961
Yeah.

1655
01:45:07.028 --> 01:45:09.019
You got the nerve, Doc.

1656
01:45:10.098 --> 01:45:12.328
It's time to give it up.

1657
01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:13.833
Aah!

1658
01:45:13.901 --> 01:45:15.232
Aah!

1659
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:29.081
Aah!

1660
01:46:35.116 --> 01:46:36.083
Where's my son?

1661
01:46:36.150 --> 01:46:38.277
Kill me to find him, Frank.

1662
01:46:38.352 --> 01:46:41.014
That was the deal.

1663
01:46:49.263 --> 01:46:50.958
Yee-haw!

1664
01:46:58.139 --> 01:46:59.868
Aah.

1665
01:47:45.353 --> 01:47:46.581
Oh!

1666
01:47:46.654 --> 01:47:49.122
Aah!

1667
01:47:57.799 --> 01:47:59.164
Oh!

1668
01:48:53.921 --> 01:48:55.855
Southern Pacific 20-10,

1669
01:48:55.923 --> 01:48:57.720
this is Colorado State Patrol.

1670
01:48:57.791 --> 01:48:59.349
Try him again.

1671
01:48:59.426 --> 01:49:01.360
You know, Tex is an old fella.

1672
01:49:01.428 --> 01:49:03.862
Just because he doesn't
answer his radio


1673
01:49:03.931 --> 01:49:06.195
doesn't mean..

1674
01:49:06.267 --> 01:49:07.700
You know, that's odd.

1675
01:49:07.768 --> 01:49:10.362
There's no smoke coming
out of that smokestack.


1676
01:49:12.439 --> 01:49:13.371
Sy!

1677
01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:14.998
Sy, get the dispatcher!

1678
01:49:22.216 --> 01:49:23.308
Buck.

1679
01:49:25.219 --> 01:49:26.481
Oh, my God.

1680
01:49:26.554 --> 01:49:27.680
Frank.

1681
01:49:34.395 --> 01:49:35.828
Back there.

1682
01:49:39.233 --> 01:49:41.167
Take care of this one.

1683
01:49:44.638 --> 01:49:46.333
Is that him?

1684
01:49:49.410 --> 01:49:51.344
The killer's dead.

1685
01:49:52.913 --> 01:49:54.847
What about your boy?

1686
01:49:57.918 --> 01:50:00.352
Just hang in there, son.

1687
01:50:00.421 --> 01:50:02.082
We'll get you to the hospital.

1688
01:50:02.156 --> 01:50:04.351
He's lost a lot of blood.

1689
01:50:04.425 --> 01:50:06.359
He's got hypothermia.

1690
01:50:20.507 --> 01:50:22.338
Help me up.

1691
01:50:24.878 --> 01:50:26.311
Sir, you better come here.

1692
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:18.364
Gracias, amigo.

1693
01:51:22.703 --> 01:51:25.263
He said the city
condemned this place


1694
01:51:25.339 --> 01:51:26.772
about 2 months ago.

1695
01:51:28.208 --> 01:51:30.301
Ain't nobody lived here since.

1696
01:51:38.018 --> 01:51:39.781
He's missing his son.

1697
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:31.838
The guy was a killer, Frank.

1698
01:52:43.884 --> 01:52:45.146
Yeah.

1699
01:52:47.721 --> 01:52:49.848
But he wasn't a liar.

1700
01:53:35.369 --> 01:53:36.802
Andy.

1701
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:38.633
Daddy!

1702
01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:11.600

Martina McBride
Singing:  Whoa whoa


1704
01:54:20.347 --> 01:54:22.781
Whoa oh oh

1705
01:54:24.585 --> 01:54:28.282
Where I used to have a heart

1706
01:54:28.355 --> 01:54:32.291
Feels like a mile-wide ditch

1707
01:54:32.359 --> 01:54:36.295
I got a hole inside

1708
01:54:36.363 --> 01:54:40.129
The doctor just can't stitch

1709
01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.136
Gone without a trace

1710
01:54:44.204 --> 01:54:46.297
You left a hollow

1711
01:54:46.373 --> 01:54:49.308
Place

1712
01:54:49.376 --> 01:54:53.312
There's not a stone to mark

1713
01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:55.314
Where I

1714
01:54:55.382 --> 01:54:57.782
Used to have

1715
01:54:57.851 --> 01:55:00.319
A heart

1716
01:55:00.387 --> 01:55:04.153
There were times when
I would hold you


1717
01:55:04.224 --> 01:55:08.320
And feel the
poundin' in my chest


1718
01:55:08.395 --> 01:55:11.990
And now I'm just as empty

1719
01:55:12.066 --> 01:55:15.832
As a canyon way out west

1720
01:55:15.903 --> 01:55:19.339
That's how deep I loved you

1721
01:55:19.406 --> 01:55:23.274
Babe, I love you still

1722
01:55:23.343 --> 01:55:26.278
To the bottom of this space

1723
01:55:26.346 --> 01:55:30.942
I'll never fill

1724
01:55:31.018 --> 01:55:35.114
Where I used to have a heart

1725
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:38.955

A heart

1735
01:56:22.836 --> 01:56:26.272
Guess I'll learn
to live with


1736
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:30.106
A different kind of pain

1737
01:56:30.177 --> 01:56:33.613
I'm sufferin'
from a sickness


1738
01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:37.275
That I cannot give a name

1739
01:56:37.351 --> 01:56:41.447
It's such a strange sensation

1740
01:56:41.522 --> 01:56:45.288
I've never felt before

1741
01:56:45.359 --> 01:56:46.951
Missin' you

1742
01:56:47.027 --> 01:56:48.392
Has cut me

1743
01:56:48.462 --> 01:56:52.296
To the core
