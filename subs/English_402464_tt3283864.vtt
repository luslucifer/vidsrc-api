00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.121
- Hey!

2
00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:00.088
- Sorry.

3
00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:08.830
Hey!

4
00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:09.865
Fucking give it to me, please!

5
00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:10.699
- Just let us see it.

6
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:11.633
- No!

7
00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:12.367
- Come on, just let us see it.

8
00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.301
- Give it to me!

9
00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:14.169
- Okay okay okay, fine, fine.

10
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:15.404
Not them, just me.

11
00:01:15.406 --> 00:01:16.571
- Dude, come on, cut it out.

12
00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:18.240
- I won't take
a picture, I swear, see?

13
00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:19.441
- Jeremy!

14
00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:20.242
- Phone's away, just let me see it.

15
00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:21.076
- Everyone is gonna see.

16
00:01:21.078 --> 00:01:22.077
- Hold on.

17
00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.712
We're negotiating.

18
00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:26.681
- Seriously man, just stop being assholes.

19
00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:28.183
Come on, this is stupid.

20
00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:29.151
- Let go!

21
00:01:56.612 --> 00:01:58.380
- No no no, I got it.

22
00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:00.348
Take what's-his-face, the Korean kid,

23
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.151
fucking kwong wah kow or one of those

24
00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:04.486
horrible names or something. 
- Dude, his parents are

25
00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:06.188
loaded, I should be so lucky.

26
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.622
They probably pick me up in a

27
00:02:07.624 --> 00:02:10.292
hot tub rollover or something.

28
00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:12.227
- The kid in pe,.

29
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.862
- His would warp the corsage.

30
00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:15.697
- Oh come on, it'd be
your good deed for the year.

31
00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.532
Pull a Christine and have all the

32
00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:18.934
kids vote for him for prom king.

33
00:02:18.936 --> 00:02:20.402
- Dude, the movie's Carrie, dipshit.

34
00:02:20.404 --> 00:02:22.571
- No no no, hold on, i got it, 
I totally got it.

35
00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:23.572
You know who you should go with?

36
00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:24.406
- Yeah, who?

37
00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:25.340
- Cyclops.

38
00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:26.741
- Oh my god, you're so fucked.

39
00:02:26.743 --> 00:02:28.310
- Watch him show up with
a parrot and a peg leg.

40
00:02:28.312 --> 00:02:29.244
- He's right there.

41
00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:30.145
- So go ask him.

42
00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:31.346
- No!

43
00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:32.481
- Come on, now's your chance, go on.

44
00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:34.216
Fine, fine, I'll do it.

45
00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:35.250
Hey.

46
00:02:35.252 --> 00:02:36.084
Hey you.

47
00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:37.185
What's his name?

48
00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:38.019
- Mike?

49
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:39.254
- Hey, hey Mike!

50
00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:40.088
Hey!

51
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.922
- Shut up!

52
00:02:40.924 --> 00:02:42.457
- Jesus, come on.

53
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.393
Where are you going?

54
00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.262
- This is ridiculous.

55
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:49.731
- We're awful.

56
00:03:23.232 --> 00:03:24.533
- Hey eyeball!

57
00:03:26.936 --> 00:03:30.138
There's something to your right!

58
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.339
Just kidding.

59
00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:37.579
Careful, watch your, nah, just kidding.

60
00:03:37.581 --> 00:03:40.715
Goddammit Matt, would you stop fucking walking already?

61
00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:42.751
Get in the goddamn car.

62
00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:50.992
Hurry up, come on.

63
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.965
Dude, so I got this new game.

64
00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.167
Open world, sandbox kind of game.

65
00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.468
I dunno, it doesn't even have

66
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.903
a name yet, that's how new it is.

67
00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:04.306
My aunt grabbed this advanced

68
00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:06.474
beta testing copy in la, oh yeah,

69
00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:08.610
she's staying with us by the way.

70
00:04:08.612 --> 00:04:09.878
You'll meet her, she's cool.

71
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.513
Anyway, it's nuts!

72
00:04:12.548 --> 00:04:13.782
Anywhere you wanna go, you can go,

73
00:04:13.784 --> 00:04:15.050
anything you wanna do, you can do.

74
00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:16.751
You can steal jets.

75
00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:19.888
- No, you can't just, yeah, that's why

76
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.157
they got a joint account, douchebag

77
00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.593
because it's both of ours, you can't,

78
00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:26.861
yes, yes I did, every paycheck!

79
00:04:26.863 --> 00:04:28.163
Yeah, and if I don't see every penny

80
00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:29.331

81
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:30.332
lawyer in your ass so fast it'll

82
00:04:30.334 --> 00:04:31.700
make your fucking head explode!

83
00:04:31.702 --> 00:04:33.234
Hey!

84
00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:36.004
Hey, can you go get
hunter please, he's in his crib!

85
00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:38.506
Wait wait wait wait wait, hold on.

86
00:04:38.508 --> 00:04:40.875
What do you mean until
i give back the ring?

87
00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:43.511
I gave back the ring.

88
00:04:43.513 --> 00:04:44.512
Yes.

89
00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:47.649
Yes I did, when you were here!

90
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.583
- I got you.

91
00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:51.419
- Are you high or just retarded?

92
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:55.390
Yeah, yeah, that's what i
thought, that's what I thought.

93
00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:57.926
- Mr. Cahill is out
sick, but he has left me

94
00:04:57.928 --> 00:05:01.196
instructions to have you work on group projects.

95
00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:03.932
Today you will be dissecting fetal pigs.

96
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.333
If you do not feel comfortable dissecting

97
00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:06.635
the actual animals, there are computers

98
00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:07.869
set up on the
side of the room that

99
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.205
will take you through the virtual process.

100
00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:13.441
Okay, split up into
groups of two and you

101
00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:17.078
can find your specimens on the back table.

102
00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.291
- Okay, so it says here we need

103
00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:32.761
to insert the blade through the

104
00:05:32.763 --> 00:05:34.462
body on one side of the umbilical cord

105
00:05:34.464 --> 00:05:38.566
and cut posteriorly to
the base of the leg.

106
00:05:38.568 --> 00:05:41.202
What do you say,
you wanna do the honors?

107
00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:42.771
Okay, I'll do it.

108
00:05:46.275 --> 00:05:48.143
Who's getting hungry?

109
00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:51.746
That was a joke.

110
00:05:51.748 --> 00:05:53.114
Well, I mean...

111
00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:56.051
I'm a vegetarian, but it's also

112
00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:57.719
because of the whole animal rights

113
00:05:57.721 --> 00:05:58.953
thing more than just 'cause I got a

114
00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:02.257
waistband the size of a low-flying blimp.

115
00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:06.161
That was a joke too.

116
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:06.995
Kinda.

117
00:06:06.997 --> 00:06:08.563
Okay, never mind.

118
00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.434
Extend a single cut along the midline

119
00:06:12.436 --> 00:06:13.702
of the ventricular surface of the

120
00:06:13.704 --> 00:06:14.903
animal to about two centimeters

121
00:06:14.905 --> 00:06:16.171
from the chain, cut completely

122
00:06:16.173 --> 00:06:17.372
through the how-to,

123
00:06:17.374 --> 00:06:18.873
okay, what is this, rocket science?

124
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:19.841
All right.

125
00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:29.317
- Hey, what's going on?

126
00:06:30.352 --> 00:06:33.321
- I wanna suck off Justin langsey.

127
00:06:33.323 --> 00:06:34.289
- Who?

128
00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:36.224
- Number six.

129
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.895
He's so clumsy, I love it.

130
00:06:40.897 --> 00:06:42.197
I just wanna yank down those little

131
00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.199
black shorts of his and suck his dick.

132
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:45.834
- Okay, all right.

133
00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:49.537
- But he's got
a small dick, you know?

134
00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:50.605
You don't believe me about this,

135
00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:51.773
but I've got a sixth sense about

136
00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:53.508
these kinds of things, i do, seriously.

137
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.776
- I believe you.

138
00:06:54.778 --> 00:06:56.077
- I bet it is the
size of a dry erase marker.

139
00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.345
- Okay, do you wanna
just get out of here?

140
00:06:57.347 --> 00:07:00.782
- I don't care you know, 
I'd suck it anyway.

141
00:07:00.784 --> 00:07:02.217
Probably make it easier.

142
00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:03.184
- Hello?

143
00:07:04.286 --> 00:07:06.054
- God he's beautiful.

144
00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:07.422
- Hey, you done?

145
00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:08.990
- Yeah, yeah.

146
00:07:08.992 --> 00:07:10.058
- Let's go.

147
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.393
So the kid is just standing there

148
00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:13.962
with his harmonica in his mouth.

149
00:07:13.964 --> 00:07:14.896
- Right.

150
00:07:14.898 --> 00:07:16.331
- And his dad's on his shoulders

151
00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:17.799
with a noose around his neck--

152
00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:21.002
- oh shit, I gotta
introduce you to Jill, hold on.

153
00:07:21.004 --> 00:07:22.237
Jill!

154
00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:23.471
- Basically he's just left to stand

155
00:07:23.473 --> 00:07:26.007
there until, basically until he passes out.

156
00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:27.242
- Jill!

157
00:07:27.244 --> 00:07:29.344
- And his dad
hangs to death, it's insane,

158
00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:31.679
it's such a great, great shot,

159
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:34.883
I'll have to show it to you sometime.

160
00:07:34.885 --> 00:07:35.850
- Yeah.

161
00:07:35.852 --> 00:07:38.520
Wait, how does he
play the harmonica if hes's--

162
00:07:38.522 --> 00:07:40.054
- he's not playing the harmonica.

163
00:07:40.056 --> 00:07:41.022
- Jill!

164
00:07:42.057 --> 00:07:43.858
- It's like, it's just like a simple--

165
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.527
- she must've gone out.

166
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:48.163
You wanna play video games?

167
00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:49.130
Fuck.

168
00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:52.200
Shit.

169
00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:55.737
- So there was this
new girl in bio today.

170
00:07:55.739 --> 00:07:56.571
- Oh yeah?

171
00:07:56.573 --> 00:07:57.806
Is she cute?

172
00:07:57.808 --> 00:07:58.973
Is she cute, you gonna ask her out?

173
00:07:58.975 --> 00:07:59.941
You gonna break some hearts?

174
00:07:59.943 --> 00:08:01.176
- Pfft.

175
00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:02.377
- What pfft, what do
you say it like that for?

176
00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:03.211
Come on.

177
00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:04.145
You are a handsome--

178
00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:05.313
- I just mean--

179
00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:06.314
- you're a handsome goddamn dude,

180
00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:07.916
seriously, I mean it, you got

181
00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:09.217
this whole monocular man thing

182
00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:10.552
going on, total secret agent,

183
00:08:10.554 --> 00:08:13.955
total Nick fury, 
Nick fucking fury man,

184
00:08:14.957 --> 00:08:17.458
except in the comic
books, not in the movie,

185
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.896
you're not Samuel l. 
Jackson, you're not bald.

186
00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:23.131
Or black.

187
00:08:23.133 --> 00:08:24.866
- But dude, she is
the size of a house.

188
00:08:24.868 --> 00:08:27.235
I mean she should save time and

189
00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:29.003
shove me in a trash compactor.

190
00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:30.805
This girl would crush me.

191
00:08:30.807 --> 00:08:32.040
- No no no, she's not too fat.

192
00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:32.907
- Yeah she is.

193
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.576
- She's not that fat.

194
00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:37.178
Just four feet too short, fuck.

195
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.146
- What?

196
00:08:39.448 --> 00:08:43.284
- What do fat women
and mopeds have in common?

197
00:08:43.286 --> 00:08:44.719
- I don't know.

198
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:46.020
- They're both to fun
to ride, but you wouldn't

199
00:08:46.022 --> 00:08:47.789
want your friends to
see you on either one.

200
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.759
Right?

201
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.494
- Okay, I have one.

202
00:08:54.997 --> 00:08:56.231
- Okay.

203
00:08:56.233 --> 00:08:58.066
- How do you
find a fat girl's vagina?

204
00:08:58.068 --> 00:08:59.534
- How?

205
00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:02.503
- You flip through the
folds until you smell crap.

206
00:09:02.505 --> 00:09:03.705
Then you go back one.

207
00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:07.775
- Where did you even hear that?

208
00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:10.178
- I don't know, it
was on the Internet or something.

209
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.115
- Hey where were you, we
were looking all over for you.

210
00:09:14.117 --> 00:09:16.918
Oh yeah, Matt, Jill, Jill, Matt.

211
00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:18.853
- Hey.

212
00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:33.468
Is anyone sitting here?

213
00:09:38.707 --> 00:09:40.675
So you're elmo's aunt?

214
00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:46.214
I mean that's pretty weird right?

215
00:09:46.216 --> 00:09:48.516
How does that even happen?

216
00:09:50.653 --> 00:09:54.389
- His mom is my
sister and my dad's his grandpa.

217
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:57.525
What, do you want me
to draw you a family tree?

218
00:09:57.527 --> 00:09:59.260
- No, no, I just...

219
00:10:01.563 --> 00:10:04.699
I don't know, 'cause i
mean my sister and I,

220
00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:07.568
we're like, I don't know, 
I was just trying--

221
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.237
- you was just trying
to make some weird roundabout

222
00:10:09.239 --> 00:10:11.272
apology for hurting my feelings the other day.

223
00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:12.507
- What--

224
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:14.042
- which is fucking lame by the way.

225
00:10:14.044 --> 00:10:17.445
You can do that with
a fucking fat joke, ugh.

226
00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:20.548
So you clearly wanna make amends or

227
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.517
pacify your conscience or weasel me

228
00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.851
into bed or whatever the fuck it is

229
00:10:23.853 --> 00:10:25.053
that you're trying to do, - wait, what?

230
00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:28.289
So why don't you
just get it over with?

231
00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:33.027
"I'm sorry"?

232
00:10:35.531 --> 00:10:37.165
- Okay, I'm sorry.

233
00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.767
- Do you mean it?

234
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:40.835
- Yeah.

235
00:10:40.837 --> 00:10:41.803
- Great.

236
00:10:42.972 --> 00:10:47.275
We can be friends again, take a seat.

237
00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:57.518
So how long have you known--

238
00:11:14.636 --> 00:11:15.937
you know what?

239
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:22.110
This isn't really doing it for me.

240
00:11:22.112 --> 00:11:25.813
You wanna get out of
here and eat someplace else?

241
00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:26.981
- Sure.

242
00:11:26.983 --> 00:11:28.349
I'll call elmo.

243
00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:30.651
- Okay.

244
00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:38.226
Where are we?

245
00:11:38.228 --> 00:11:39.460
- Yeah, where the fuck
are we going man, come on.

246
00:11:39.462 --> 00:11:41.462
- No, it's going, we're going to this

247
00:11:41.464 --> 00:11:43.898
cool cafe, bar, diner type, I don't

248
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.199
know what it is,
but there is a bar

249
00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:47.201
inside, we don't have to be 21.

250
00:11:47.203 --> 00:11:48.736
I used to go there
all the time with my sister,

251
00:11:48.738 --> 00:11:52.607
they've got great food, great corned beef hash.

252
00:11:52.609 --> 00:11:56.911
I mean they have salads and
stuff too, so you're all set.

253
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.515
- Dude, did you just call me fat?

254
00:12:02.451 --> 00:12:03.284
- What?

255
00:12:03.286 --> 00:12:04.519
- What the fuck dude?

256
00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:06.287
- No, 'cause in
class you said that thing

257
00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:09.357
about being a vegetarian, so I just thought...

258
00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:11.059
No no no no, hey, I didn't--

259
00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:12.326
- you're an insensitive motherfucker.

260
00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:13.661
- I didn't mean anything by it.

261
00:12:13.663 --> 00:12:15.863
Hey, hey, I'm really, goddammit.

262
00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:17.265
- Why don't you
go for a walk, okay?

263
00:12:17.267 --> 00:12:18.099
Take a minute.

264
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.801
- I, I wasn't trying--

265
00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:21.035
- why don't you just tell her

266
00:12:21.037 --> 00:12:22.403
to go on a diet or something, huh?

267
00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:24.072
- I didn't mean, that's not what

268
00:12:24.074 --> 00:12:25.706
I meant at all, goddammit.

269
00:12:25.708 --> 00:12:27.108
- What if she said
something about your eye, huh?

270
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.643
What if she said something about your eye?

271
00:12:28.645 --> 00:12:31.112
Would you be okay with that? 
- I don't care, ooooh shit.

272
00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:34.749
- We got you!

273
00:12:34.751 --> 00:12:35.550
- Nice!

274
00:12:35.552 --> 00:12:37.218
- That was so good!

275
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.786
I wish you've could've seen your face.

276
00:12:38.788 --> 00:12:39.787
- Oh yeah, that was good.

277
00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:41.222
- Did you see his face?

278
00:12:41.224 --> 00:12:42.924
You literally looked like
I was about to shoot

279
00:12:42.926 --> 00:12:44.859
your fucking puppy, man. 
- That's not fucking funny.

280
00:12:44.861 --> 00:12:48.463
- Come on, I was
just fucking with you, dude!

281
00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:50.064
Do I look like a
salad type of girl to you?

282
00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:51.566
I have my own fucking zip code, man.

283
00:12:51.568 --> 00:12:52.533
- I don't know.

284
00:12:52.535 --> 00:12:53.835
- Oh, that reminds me of a joke.

285
00:12:53.837 --> 00:12:56.137
What do fat women
and mopeds have in common?

286
00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:57.572
- Elmo already told me that joke.

287
00:12:57.574 --> 00:12:59.240
- Oh fuck you, you fucking thief.

288
00:12:59.242 --> 00:13:01.509
- What do you mean
fucking thief, it's a good joke.

289
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.245
- No, it's a shitty
goddamn joke, but it's my joke.

290
00:13:04.247 --> 00:13:06.380
- You can't take ownership
of a joke, it's everyone's joke.

291
00:13:06.382 --> 00:13:07.215
- Whatever.

292
00:13:07.217 --> 00:13:09.350
- That's how jokes work.

293
00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:13.387
- So what about you then?

294
00:13:14.456 --> 00:13:15.523
I think it's gonna be great.

295
00:13:15.525 --> 00:13:16.757
- Can you get behind that?

296
00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:17.992
- Just, I don't have road rage, okay?

297
00:13:17.994 --> 00:13:19.193
People that have road rage do things that

298
00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:21.796
are unnecessary, 
I yell when it's necessary.

299
00:13:21.798 --> 00:13:23.698
- Yeah, I'm telling
you you still have to

300
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.134
be the bigger person in that situation.

301
00:13:26.136 --> 00:13:27.869
- Be the bigger,
have you looked at me?

302
00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:29.804
I'm never the bigger person.

303
00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:31.672
- Never, I've known him
for a very long time.

304
00:13:31.674 --> 00:13:33.174
- Okay, all right, all right.

305
00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:37.245
Oh shit, I gotta go.

306
00:13:37.247 --> 00:13:38.412
Look out, look out.

307
00:13:38.414 --> 00:13:39.747
- What are you doing?

308
00:13:39.749 --> 00:13:41.949
- My mother just
texted me, I gotta go.

309
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.018
I forgot, I promised her. 
- Where are you going?

310
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.720
- I gotta go make lobster triangles

311
00:13:45.722 --> 00:13:47.255
with her for some benefit.

312
00:13:47.257 --> 00:13:48.489
- Lobster triangles?

313
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:50.758
- Kids with aids thing, whatever.

314
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.227
Hey, can you drive him home?

315
00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:55.363
- Yeah, I can.

316
00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:57.465
- Great, okay cool, 
I'll see you guys later, bye.

317
00:13:57.467 --> 00:13:58.432
- See ya.

318
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:09.243
I'm about, oh.

319
00:14:11.614 --> 00:14:12.813
- He's funny.

320
00:14:12.815 --> 00:14:13.781
- Yeah.

321
00:14:54.156 --> 00:14:55.356
- Can I have a drag?

322
00:14:55.358 --> 00:14:56.324
- Sure.

323
00:15:15.844 --> 00:15:16.877
Nice place.

324
00:15:18.013 --> 00:15:19.647
- Yeah, it's okay.

325
00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:21.782
- Just saying.

326
00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:30.458
So...

327
00:15:32.261 --> 00:15:33.227
- What?

328
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.269
I got so much homework to do.

329
00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:44.305
- Huh?

330
00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:46.941
- Got that calc test tomorrow.

331
00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:49.610
- Right, calc test.

332
00:15:51.713 --> 00:15:53.714
- But thanks for the ride.

333
00:15:53.716 --> 00:15:54.949
- Yeah, sure.

334
00:15:56.885 --> 00:15:57.852
- Goodbye.

335
00:15:57.854 --> 00:15:58.819
- Bye.

336
00:16:31.253 --> 00:16:32.086
- Hey.

337
00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:34.022
- Shh shh.

338
00:16:34.022 --> 00:16:38.159
You weaselly motherfucker.

339
00:16:40.495 --> 00:16:42.163
- Did you have your book club tonight?

340
00:16:42.165 --> 00:16:43.631
- Yeah, where were you?

341
00:16:43.633 --> 00:16:45.066
You were supposed to watch
him, I got home at

342
00:16:45.068 --> 00:16:46.467
the end of a double
expecting to drop him off.

343
00:16:46.469 --> 00:16:47.968
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

344
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.105
- God, this kid came in
right at the end of my shift.

345
00:16:51.107 --> 00:16:53.808
Decided to blow his head
off with his father's shotgun.

346
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.076
Chickened out at the last minute trying

347
00:16:55.078 --> 00:16:56.310
to split the difference and instead

348
00:16:56.312 --> 00:16:57.978
lost his jaw, it's a fucking mess.

349
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.782
- I know, I'm so
sorry, just some stuff came up.

350
00:17:01.784 --> 00:17:04.251
Did you end up skipping the meeting?

351
00:17:04.253 --> 00:17:06.153
- Nah, I took him.

352
00:17:06.155 --> 00:17:07.688
Screamed his head off half the night,

353
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.690
but it was a horror novel, so whatever.

354
00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:11.692
- Yeah, how was it?

355
00:17:11.694 --> 00:17:13.427
- Oh are you kidding me?

356
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:16.564
It was shit, they're all
shit, but whatever, they're fun.

357
00:17:16.566 --> 00:17:17.531
- Good.

358
00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:24.171
Hey, can I ask you something, and just

359
00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.674
promise not to... 
- You shut up.

360
00:17:26.676 --> 00:17:27.775
What?

361
00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:29.210
Shut up, what?

362
00:17:29.212 --> 00:17:30.945
- Make fun of me or whatever?

363
00:17:30.947 --> 00:17:33.180
- Come on, when I have
i ever made fun of you?

364
00:17:33.182 --> 00:17:34.281
- Like all the time?

365
00:17:34.283 --> 00:17:36.517
- Right, but lovingly.

366
00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:37.818
So what is it?

367
00:17:39.588 --> 00:17:41.389
What's the question?

368
00:17:42.624 --> 00:17:44.158
Hello!

369
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.095
- Okay, it's stupid, no,
just, sorry, forget it, never mind.

370
00:17:53.168 --> 00:17:54.702
All right, how...

371
00:17:55.904 --> 00:17:59.039
How do you tell
if a girl likes you?

372
00:18:32.974 --> 00:18:35.009
- So basically they
just go over the lake

373
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:36.644
and then I just shoot
them with my twin Gauge.

374
00:18:36.646 --> 00:18:37.945
- I'm kinda scared of you right now.

375
00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:39.180
- Oh my gosh!

376
00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:40.614
- I'm just saying, 
I'm just saying, it's like--

377
00:18:40.616 --> 00:18:42.016
- oh come on, it's really fun.

378
00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:43.017
It's like basically just--

379
00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:44.585
- I kinda wanna, oh!

380
00:18:44.587 --> 00:18:46.020
- Whoa, what the fuck?

381
00:18:46.022 --> 00:18:49.156
Watch where you're going, you fat...

382
00:18:50.392 --> 00:18:52.426
- I'm sorry, do you have
something you wanna say to me?

383
00:18:52.428 --> 00:18:54.462
- No, it's too easy.

384
00:18:54.464 --> 00:18:56.664
You have a beautiful day.

385
00:19:03.638 --> 00:19:05.406
- Sorry about that, i don't know what's

386
00:19:05.408 --> 00:19:06.841
going on, they're not normally like that.

387
00:19:06.843 --> 00:19:09.710
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure they are.

388
00:19:11.112 --> 00:19:13.881
- Oh hey, I
see someone's in ap English.

389
00:19:13.883 --> 00:19:15.082
I love this book, have you actually got

390
00:19:15.084 --> 00:19:16.617
to the part where Sally tells Phillip that

391
00:19:16.619 --> 00:19:18.786
she's pregnant right before he's about to--

392
00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:20.855
- thanks for your help!

393
00:19:30.131 --> 00:19:30.965
- Ow!

394
00:19:30.967 --> 00:19:31.799
- Hey.

395
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:32.633
- Fuck.

396
00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:33.901
- What's going on?

397
00:19:33.903 --> 00:19:35.903
- Nothing, just waiting.

398
00:19:35.905 --> 00:19:37.972
- Yeah, for Jill?

399
00:19:37.974 --> 00:19:39.206
- No.

400
00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:40.908
- Really, 'cause it's her car right here.

401
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.878
I mean well it's my
mom's car, but she's borrowing it.

402
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.712
- Is it?

403
00:19:44.714 --> 00:19:45.946
- Yeah, yeah.

404
00:19:45.948 --> 00:19:48.048
Didn't she give you a ride last night?

405
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.618
- Oh yeah, yeah, no, she did.

406
00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.553
- That's kinda weird, you don't remember the...

407
00:19:52.555 --> 00:19:53.754
- I guess I forgot.

408
00:19:53.756 --> 00:19:54.889
- Forgot, that's seems weird.

409
00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:56.190
Anyway, check this out.

410
00:19:56.192 --> 00:19:57.424
Folks are going to Norway on a bit

411
00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.894
of a buying trip, but
what the hell, might as

412
00:19:59.896 --> 00:20:01.996
well throw a while they're down there.

413
00:20:01.998 --> 00:20:03.230
- Oh.

414
00:20:03.232 --> 00:20:04.331
Neat.

415
00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:05.599
When is it?

416
00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:08.168
- Next month, during the regular prom-type prom.

417
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.403
- Okay.

418
00:20:09.405 --> 00:20:10.838
- Yeah, I talked to tonic, we're gonna

419
00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.940
get three kegs, have some pizza, dance around,

420
00:20:12.942 --> 00:20:14.341
play some games that don't suck,

421
00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:15.442
whatever, yeah, should be a pretty

422
00:20:15.444 --> 00:20:17.044
good time, but you should come.

423
00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:18.245
What am I saying, of course you're

424
00:20:18.247 --> 00:20:19.647
gonna come, what else
do you have to do?

425
00:20:19.649 --> 00:20:20.581
Sit around your house having

426
00:20:20.583 --> 00:20:22.016
no depth perception or whatever?

427
00:20:22.018 --> 00:20:22.950
- Come on.

428
00:20:22.952 --> 00:20:24.084
- Hey, how far's my hand?

429
00:20:24.086 --> 00:20:24.885
How far's my hand? 
- Stop it.

430
00:20:24.887 --> 00:20:25.553
- How far's my hand?

431
00:20:25.555 --> 00:20:26.720
- Fuck you, man.

432
00:20:26.722 --> 00:20:27.655
- Anyway, I'm gonna go to kinko's

433
00:20:27.657 --> 00:20:28.722
and make some copies, and I need

434
00:20:28.724 --> 00:20:30.190
you to come with me, all right?

435
00:20:30.192 --> 00:20:32.026
So let's go, let's go, come on.

436
00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:33.527
- Hey, I really can't...

437
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:34.895
- Oh hey, what's going on?

438
00:20:34.897 --> 00:20:36.363
- What's happening?

439
00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:37.565
- Trying to get one-eyed Willy

440
00:20:37.567 --> 00:20:39.099
here to go to kinko's for copies.

441
00:20:39.101 --> 00:20:41.035
- Mmm-mmm, sorry.

442
00:20:41.037 --> 00:20:43.304
Did you tell him about our project?

443
00:20:43.306 --> 00:20:44.138
- What?

444
00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.739
- What project?

445
00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:47.541
- Wait, you really didn't tell?

446
00:20:47.543 --> 00:20:51.612
We, this is so funny.

447
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.315
Yeah, no, we have a thing.

448
00:20:54.317 --> 00:20:55.716
We have to go to the beach and

449
00:20:55.718 --> 00:20:57.818
collect 20 different types of

450
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.788
shells for this thing or whatever.

451
00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.624
Yeah, but you didn't tell him?

452
00:21:03.626 --> 00:21:05.426
- You have to
go to the beach to

453
00:21:05.428 --> 00:21:07.294
collect shells in the winter?

454
00:21:07.296 --> 00:21:08.796
- I know, right?

455
00:21:08.798 --> 00:21:10.030
What the hell is wrong
with the teachers here, right?

456
00:21:10.032 --> 00:21:12.099
We're all of a sudden
in the third grade, man?

457
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:14.068
It's like no, you
won't weasel out of this,

458
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.170
I am not doing this
shit on my own, I'm savvy

459
00:21:16.172 --> 00:21:17.938
like a motherfucking toothpick, so let's go.

460
00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.173
- Okay.

461
00:21:19.175 --> 00:21:20.441
- Yeah, no, I mean
I'm good to go too.

462
00:21:20.443 --> 00:21:21.542
- We'll see you at the house.

463
00:21:21.544 --> 00:21:22.810
- I'll call you.

464
00:21:22.812 --> 00:21:23.844
- I'll just see you, I'll see

465
00:21:23.846 --> 00:21:25.346
you tonight at the house.

466
00:21:25.348 --> 00:21:26.981
- Well give me an hour,
i can do the shells thing.

467
00:21:26.983 --> 00:21:28.816
- Yeah, I'll see you later, bye!

468
00:21:28.818 --> 00:21:30.084
- Okay, well let me
know where you're going 'cause

469
00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:33.787
I can meet you later
if you want to, right?

470
00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:40.928
- You didn't have
to do that, you know.

471
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.930
- I'm sorry, I just...

472
00:21:42.932 --> 00:21:44.231
I get to see him
all the time, I hang

473
00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:46.433
out with him every day, and he's great,

474
00:21:46.435 --> 00:21:49.570
he's great, I just know him so well.

475
00:21:51.439 --> 00:21:53.907
I want to get to know you.

476
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:55.643
More than I do now.

477
00:21:57.512 --> 00:21:58.779
Is that weird?

478
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:00.614
- Hey, are we going
to the beach right now?

479
00:22:00.616 --> 00:22:01.548
To collect shells?

480
00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.150
- No, fuck that.

481
00:22:03.152 --> 00:22:05.019
What am I, a personal ad?

482
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:07.054
No, let's go to the dump.

483
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:04.278
- Anti-prom?

484
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.879
That's wicked cool.

485
00:23:05.881 --> 00:23:07.214
- Thank you.

486
00:23:07.216 --> 00:23:08.816
- Yeah, you did this all by yourself?

487
00:23:08.818 --> 00:23:10.050
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

488
00:23:10.052 --> 00:23:13.620
- God, you're really talented, that's cool.

489
00:23:13.622 --> 00:23:15.589
You go to Ben frank?

490
00:23:15.591 --> 00:23:16.857
- Yeah.

491
00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:19.226
- Oh my god, me
too, i mean I went there.

492
00:23:19.228 --> 00:23:20.527
- How much is it, by the way?

493
00:23:20.529 --> 00:23:21.528
- It's pretty brutal.

494
00:23:22.498 --> 00:23:23.864
- Yeah.

495
00:23:23.866 --> 00:23:26.266
Hey, so where is it?

496
00:23:26.268 --> 00:23:27.234
The party?

497
00:23:33.141 --> 00:23:34.374
- It's in laramie.

498
00:23:34.376 --> 00:23:37.244
So yeah, you should come.

499
00:23:37.246 --> 00:23:38.512
- Excuse me?

500
00:23:38.514 --> 00:23:40.447
- It's like shit, you fucking faggots, man.

501
00:23:40.449 --> 00:23:43.684
It's unbelievable, really, seriously.

502
00:24:02.604 --> 00:24:03.437
- Bye.

503
00:24:03.439 --> 00:24:04.404
- Bye.

504
00:24:29.864 --> 00:24:32.399
Hi, hey, is Matt right there?

505
00:24:32.401 --> 00:24:34.668
I just, I have his phone,
i wanted to return it to him.

506
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.303
- I'm sorry, who are you looking for?

507
00:24:36.305 --> 00:24:37.337
- Hey Jill!

508
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:51.852
I just need the restroom quick,
just stay here for a second.

509
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:01.762
- How old is she?

510
00:25:02.564 --> 00:25:03.697
- It's a he.

511
00:25:16.878 --> 00:25:18.011
- All right.

512
00:25:20.448 --> 00:25:21.415
Okay.

513
00:25:22.383 --> 00:25:23.350
- Yeah.

514
00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:32.693
- Shut that behind you.

515
00:25:32.695 --> 00:25:33.660
- Yeah.

516
00:26:00.722 --> 00:26:02.789
Is this your idea?

517
00:26:02.791 --> 00:26:05.125
- Oh, no, it was
like that when we moved in.

518
00:26:05.127 --> 00:26:08.528
I just never got around to changing it.

519
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:38.158
- You play?

520
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.795
- No, I used to,
but my hands are clumsy.

521
00:26:41.797 --> 00:26:44.131
Can't really keep a beat either.

522
00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:45.866
My mom got it for me

523
00:26:45.868 --> 00:26:47.567
right after the whole eye thing.

524
00:26:47.569 --> 00:26:49.403
I guess she thought 'cause my vision

525
00:26:49.405 --> 00:26:50.704
was messed up that i should focus

526
00:26:50.706 --> 00:26:53.674
on something auditory or whatever,

527
00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:58.145
but yeah, never got past chopsticks.

528
00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:19.166
You sing, Matt?

529
00:27:20.668 --> 00:27:21.635
- No.

530
00:27:22.503 --> 00:27:24.504
- You never sang before?

531
00:27:24.506 --> 00:27:27.240
- I mean I'm not a good singer.

532
00:27:27.242 --> 00:27:29.676
- Will you sing with me?

533
00:27:29.678 --> 00:27:30.610
- I don't know it.

534
00:27:30.612 --> 00:27:32.512
- Come on, okay.

535
00:27:32.514 --> 00:27:35.082
We'll start with something easy.

536
00:27:35.084 --> 00:27:35.916
Right?

537
00:27:35.918 --> 00:27:37.050
Chorus is...

538
00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:49.796
Think you can do that part?

539
00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:20.594
- You're kind of amazing.

540
00:28:20.596 --> 00:28:23.497
- Yeah.

541
00:28:46.687 --> 00:28:47.654
Okay.

542
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.096
I won't lie to you
if you don't lie to me.

543
00:28:57.131 --> 00:28:58.665
How's that sound?

544
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.535
Just be real with me.

545
00:29:04.472 --> 00:29:05.605
Shake on it?

546
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:31.598
- Oh god.

547
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.566
All right.

548
00:29:36.904 --> 00:29:37.871
Oh shit.

549
00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:23.383
How was it?

550
00:30:26.921 --> 00:30:30.223
- Like, you mean like how did it--

551
00:30:30.225 --> 00:30:33.026
- like was it okay, or...

552
00:30:33.028 --> 00:30:34.027
- I don't know, you tell me.

553
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:35.962
- Oh god.

554
00:30:35.964 --> 00:30:36.930
Jesus.

555
00:30:41.202 --> 00:30:43.503
Have you done that before?

556
00:30:44.972 --> 00:30:48.775
Oh, sorry, don't answer that, that's stupid.

557
00:30:53.514 --> 00:30:57.484
- Well I should probably get going, so...

558
00:30:57.486 --> 00:31:01.188
- Hey, I just,
can i ask you something?

559
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.689
- Sure, yeah.

560
00:31:02.691 --> 00:31:05.492
- You can totally say no
if you want, there's no pressure.

561
00:31:05.494 --> 00:31:06.693
- What is it?

562
00:31:11.866 --> 00:31:14.834
- Do you wanna
go to prom with me?

563
00:31:59.213 --> 00:32:00.614
Are you wearing makeup?

564
00:32:00.616 --> 00:32:02.182
- No.

565
00:32:02.184 --> 00:32:03.783
Chicks walking around with paint slathered on

566
00:32:03.785 --> 00:32:06.920
their faces, they look like fucking oompa loompas.

567
00:32:06.922 --> 00:32:07.887
Seriously.

568
00:32:08.723 --> 00:32:10.257
Why, do you care?

569
00:32:11.292 --> 00:32:15.228
- Oh no, I just
thought most girls did is all.

570
00:32:16.063 --> 00:32:18.365
- Well I'm not most girls.

571
00:32:34.949 --> 00:32:36.383
What the?

572
00:32:36.385 --> 00:32:37.984
Oh no fucking way, dude!

573
00:32:37.986 --> 00:32:40.053
- Are you okay?

574
00:32:40.055 --> 00:32:41.454
Oh shit.

575
00:32:41.456 --> 00:32:44.124
Maybe I can get some...

576
00:32:44.126 --> 00:32:48.428
Can try and find
some shoes around here somewhere.

577
00:32:53.267 --> 00:32:56.236
- Wanna go to elmo's thing?

578
00:32:56.238 --> 00:32:57.437
- You mean do i wanna play cleanup

579
00:32:57.439 --> 00:32:59.039
crew for party of the year?

580
00:32:59.041 --> 00:33:00.440
Nah.

581
00:33:00.442 --> 00:33:02.075
- Yeah, me neither.

582
00:33:04.378 --> 00:33:06.846
- So what should we do then?

583
00:34:01.936 --> 00:34:05.739
Who did you imagine yourself ending up with?

584
00:34:06.474 --> 00:34:08.274
- What do you mean?

585
00:34:08.276 --> 00:34:10.043
- You know, when you lie around

586
00:34:10.045 --> 00:34:13.012
and think about girls or whatever.

587
00:34:15.249 --> 00:34:17.751
What do you think she'd be like?

588
00:34:17.753 --> 00:34:19.886
Is she anything like me?

589
00:34:23.858 --> 00:34:24.891
- Honestly?

590
00:34:28.262 --> 00:34:32.565
I just spent so much time
trying to get through each day.

591
00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:38.037
Girls never really crossed my mind.

592
00:34:40.074 --> 00:34:43.376
I know that sounds so pathetic, but...

593
00:34:47.715 --> 00:34:50.083
What about you, what'd you think of me?

594
00:34:50.085 --> 00:34:51.551
- Of you?

595
00:34:51.553 --> 00:34:53.019
- You can be honest you know,

596
00:34:53.021 --> 00:34:54.888
I don't care, I'm just curious.

597
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:55.855
- I...

598
00:34:57.291 --> 00:34:59.759
I thought you were handsome.

599
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:11.104
Can I see it?

600
00:35:37.131 --> 00:35:38.531
- Sorry.

601
00:35:44.438 --> 00:35:45.438
- Check it out.

602
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.140
Cyclops has a lady.

603
00:35:47.142 --> 00:35:48.741
If ever there were two

604
00:35:48.743 --> 00:35:52.245
people who shouldn't be allowed to procreate.

605
00:35:52.247 --> 00:35:53.546
- Maybe they're free.

606
00:35:53.548 --> 00:35:54.514
- Right?

607
00:35:56.684 --> 00:36:00.353
Fuck it, models don't need to talk.

608
00:36:00.355 --> 00:36:01.688
Talking to you.

609
00:36:10.865 --> 00:36:12.065
- What happened?

610
00:36:12.067 --> 00:36:13.466
Okay, so you know that list they posted

611
00:36:13.468 --> 00:36:16.436
in the hallway, the
one on the school list,

612
00:36:16.438 --> 00:36:18.438
which schools people have gotten into?

613
00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.873
- Yeah.

614
00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:22.909
- Okay, well Justin
langsey got into pilgrim mass.

615
00:36:22.911 --> 00:36:25.445
- Oh yeah, that's the
school you're going to right?

616
00:36:25.447 --> 00:36:26.746
- I mean at first I
was like I'll think about it,

617
00:36:26.748 --> 00:36:28.615
but now I'm like
fuck yeah, why not right?

618
00:36:28.617 --> 00:36:30.116
But that's not even the best part.

619
00:36:30.118 --> 00:36:31.651
That's not even the best part.

620
00:36:31.653 --> 00:36:32.886
I'm standing there and I'm scanning

621
00:36:32.888 --> 00:36:35.221
the list and all of a sudden Justin

622
00:36:35.223 --> 00:36:37.857
comes up and he looks at the list,

623
00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:41.594
so I point to my
name and I go hey,

624
00:36:41.596 --> 00:36:44.364
looks like we're going to the same school.

625
00:36:44.366 --> 00:36:45.365
- All right.

626
00:36:45.367 --> 00:36:46.199
- Smooth.

627
00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:47.700
- Right, right?

628
00:36:47.702 --> 00:36:51.371
Okay, so then he says nice, 
I'll see you there, right?

629
00:36:52.673 --> 00:36:54.474
Like he wants to hang out, he thinks

630
00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:57.410
it's nice or something,
you know what I mean?

631
00:36:57.412 --> 00:36:58.645
- It's something.

632
00:36:58.647 --> 00:37:00.113
- You know who I'm talking about, Jill?

633
00:37:00.115 --> 00:37:01.614
Number six, basketball team, the nice ass?

634
00:37:01.616 --> 00:37:02.882
- Yeah, we know.

635
00:37:02.884 --> 00:37:04.851
- Oh my god, the things
i wanna do to that ass.

636
00:37:04.853 --> 00:37:05.852
- We know.

637
00:37:05.854 --> 00:37:07.086
- I wish I
could tell you, I mean

638
00:37:07.088 --> 00:37:08.555
I've told you, but oh god, I actually,

639
00:37:08.557 --> 00:37:09.822
and this is great, I had a dream

640
00:37:09.824 --> 00:37:11.190
the other night that
he came on my face--

641
00:37:11.192 --> 00:37:13.726
- would you shut the fuck up?

642
00:37:14.662 --> 00:37:15.962
- What?

643
00:37:15.964 --> 00:37:18.731
- I just don't wanna
hear about it is all.

644
00:37:18.733 --> 00:37:19.933
- What are you talking about?

645
00:37:19.935 --> 00:37:21.200
- I get that
you wanna have sex with

646
00:37:21.202 --> 00:37:22.669
Justin, and that's great, but I don't

647
00:37:22.671 --> 00:37:24.904
know why I hear
about ever single fucking detail.

648
00:37:24.906 --> 00:37:26.739
- 'Cause it's guy talk.

649
00:37:26.741 --> 00:37:27.907
- What?

650
00:37:27.909 --> 00:37:29.142
- I mean we're guys, we're talking,

651
00:37:29.144 --> 00:37:30.343
I mean you tell me about the girls.

652
00:37:30.345 --> 00:37:31.911
- No, I don't though,
when do I do that?

653
00:37:31.913 --> 00:37:33.680
- Right, you could if you wanted to,

654
00:37:33.682 --> 00:37:35.148
and I would listen to you right because

655
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.516
that's how it goes, that's what friendship is,

656
00:37:36.518 --> 00:37:38.718
we talk, that's what it is, I'd listen.

657
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.153
- All right, okay, yeah yeah,

658
00:37:40.155 --> 00:37:43.890
you're in love with a homophobic asshole!

659
00:37:43.892 --> 00:37:47.527
- Yeah, well you're in
love with a fucking slut.

660
00:37:47.529 --> 00:37:48.361
- What?

661
00:37:48.363 --> 00:37:49.629
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

662
00:37:49.631 --> 00:37:50.930
- Since when was I in this fight?

663
00:37:50.932 --> 00:37:52.966
- Hold on, did she ever tell you?

664
00:37:52.968 --> 00:37:55.134
She ever really told you why she got

665
00:37:55.136 --> 00:37:56.336
shipped across the country?

666
00:37:56.338 --> 00:37:57.537
Has she really gone into it, huh?

667
00:37:57.539 --> 00:37:59.272
- Can we not do this right now?

668
00:37:59.274 --> 00:38:01.808
- Jill, I'm sorry, has
she ever gone into it?

669
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.010
All the 40 year old fucking men,

670
00:38:04.012 --> 00:38:06.145
skeezy, middle-aged dudes that just

671
00:38:06.147 --> 00:38:07.814
wanna fuck some big-titted teenager.

672
00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:09.482
- Fuck you!

673
00:38:09.484 --> 00:38:10.717
Seriously!

674
00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:11.918
- And they still call
her too, you know that?

675
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.519
From 3,000 miles away, and you know why?

676
00:38:13.521 --> 00:38:15.021
- You're a piece of shit.

677
00:38:15.023 --> 00:38:18.391
- 'Cause they know
that she's just that desperate.

678
00:38:18.393 --> 00:38:19.459
- Fuck you!

679
00:38:20.227 --> 00:38:22.428
- Hey guys, stop, come on!

680
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.396
Come on!

681
00:38:30.471 --> 00:38:31.938
- Soon as my
parents get back from Norway,

682
00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.741
I am telling them
everything you've been up to.

683
00:38:34.743 --> 00:38:39.045
Running around, leaving class to fuck this.

684
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.247
They're gonna have you
back on a plane home

685
00:38:41.249 --> 00:38:44.817
so fuck it'll make your fucking head spin.

686
00:38:48.922 --> 00:38:50.390
- Fucking idiot!

687
00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:03.936
- He's right you know.

688
00:39:05.673 --> 00:39:06.973
- What do you mean, about what?

689
00:39:06.975 --> 00:39:08.508
- I mean if
I don't go home now,

690
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:11.044
I have to go home eventually.

691
00:39:12.146 --> 00:39:13.112
- Why?

692
00:39:14.581 --> 00:39:17.517
- My stuff's there, my friends are there.

693
00:39:17.519 --> 00:39:18.885
- Your friends?

694
00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:22.822
- I got into school there.

695
00:39:27.561 --> 00:39:28.795
- Wait, what?

696
00:39:29.563 --> 00:39:32.031
When were you gonna tell me?

697
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.801
- Dad called today.

698
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.805
The plane leaves Friday.

699
00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:42.008
- I mean what about graduation,

700
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.177
you're just gonna, just not gonna go?

701
00:39:44.179 --> 00:39:45.011
- I can't.

702
00:39:45.013 --> 00:39:47.046
- I mean what the fuck?

703
00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:49.048
I mean wow.

704
00:39:50.284 --> 00:39:54.021
Okay.

705
00:39:54.021 --> 00:39:56.989
So what, I mean
now what do we do?

706
00:39:58.659 --> 00:40:00.326
- Realistically or ideally because

707
00:40:00.328 --> 00:40:01.894
I mean in a perfect world I want

708
00:40:01.896 --> 00:40:03.563
you to move out there with me

709
00:40:03.565 --> 00:40:05.031
and just pack your shit and grab a

710
00:40:05.033 --> 00:40:06.199
plane ticket, but you wouldn't

711
00:40:06.201 --> 00:40:09.502
do that, that's crazy, so I don't know.

712
00:40:11.171 --> 00:40:12.371
I don't know.

713
00:40:20.347 --> 00:40:21.314
- Okay.

714
00:40:24.051 --> 00:40:25.485
Let's do it.

715
00:40:25.487 --> 00:40:26.686
- Do what?

716
00:40:26.688 --> 00:40:28.054
- Let's go, I wanna move with you.

717
00:40:28.056 --> 00:40:29.188
- Wait, are you serious?

718
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.022
- Yeah.

719
00:40:30.024 --> 00:40:30.923
- No.

720
00:40:30.925 --> 00:40:32.291
You wanna move?

721
00:40:34.228 --> 00:40:36.028
You'd do that for me?

722
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.096
Yeah, okay.

723
00:40:38.565 --> 00:40:40.032
- Yeah, I would.

724
00:40:41.769 --> 00:40:43.803
Come on, let's just go.

725
00:40:46.673 --> 00:40:47.640
Why not?

726
00:40:58.051 --> 00:40:59.452
- Better hurry.

727
00:41:01.121 --> 00:41:02.588
- Jill?

728
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.823
That girl you met a
couple months ago, that Jill?

729
00:41:03.825 --> 00:41:05.491
- It was 12 weeks
ago, so that's three months.

730
00:41:05.493 --> 00:41:08.694
- Oh excuse me,
three months, that's a lifetime.

731
00:41:08.696 --> 00:41:10.129
- Yup, I'm going.

732
00:41:10.131 --> 00:41:11.597
- Yeah, it certainly
looks that way doesn't it?

733
00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:14.333
- Mmmhm, we're going
this Friday and that's it,

734
00:41:14.335 --> 00:41:15.568
so if you have anything to say

735
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.803
you can just keep it to yourself.

736
00:41:16.805 --> 00:41:17.870
- So this, you're just gonna, hey,

737
00:41:17.872 --> 00:41:19.539
this, you're just gonna skip it?

738
00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:20.940
One of the most important days of

739
00:41:20.942 --> 00:41:23.276
your life and you're just gonna flat out--

740
00:41:23.278 --> 00:41:25.111
- yeah, I met someone, okay?

741
00:41:25.113 --> 00:41:26.813
I met a girl that actually likes me.

742
00:41:26.815 --> 00:41:28.047
- You'll meet others!

743
00:41:28.049 --> 00:41:29.215
- Someone who makes my heart feel like

744
00:41:29.217 --> 00:41:30.516
I'm not alone in this world, who makes

745
00:41:30.518 --> 00:41:33.653
me feel like i matter, like I'm sexy.

746
00:41:33.655 --> 00:41:34.954
Yeah, I know that sounds fucking

747
00:41:34.956 --> 00:41:37.590
stupid to you, okay, but it's true!

748
00:41:37.592 --> 00:41:38.825
Fuck it!

749
00:41:38.827 --> 00:41:40.560
Okay, I'm going, and you can't stop me.

750
00:41:40.562 --> 00:41:43.095
- You're in love with this girl?

751
00:41:43.097 --> 00:41:44.063
Go for it.

752
00:41:45.232 --> 00:41:48.167
Haul anchor, head across the country.

753
00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:51.604
No plan, no money, no safety net.

754
00:41:51.606 --> 00:41:53.039
That's what I did when mom died.

755
00:41:53.041 --> 00:41:55.174
I'd be a hypocrite if
I told you not to.

756
00:41:55.176 --> 00:41:57.043
Quick question for you, how are you

757
00:41:57.045 --> 00:42:00.146
gonna pay for rent when you're out there?

758
00:42:00.148 --> 00:42:02.415
First, last month's rent, security deposit, transportation?

759
00:42:02.417 --> 00:42:03.349
- I'll get a job.

760
00:42:03.351 --> 00:42:05.051
- Oh, of course.

761
00:42:05.053 --> 00:42:07.119
I'm sure that you
will, the economy's just kicking.

762
00:42:07.121 --> 00:42:08.387
- Just leave me alone, okay, please.

763
00:42:08.389 --> 00:42:09.322
- Just on the off chance you don't,

764
00:42:09.324 --> 00:42:10.556
what are you gonna do then?

765
00:42:10.558 --> 00:42:13.359
- Just get the fuck out of here!

766
00:42:21.368 --> 00:42:22.335
Jesus.

767
00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:24.570
Goddammit.

768
00:43:44.851 --> 00:43:46.786
- Oh my god, i
can't wait to see you,

769
00:43:46.788 --> 00:43:48.154
it's been so frigging long, I feel like

770
00:43:48.156 --> 00:43:51.390
I'm gonna die if I
don't get to fuck you soon.

771
00:43:51.392 --> 00:43:55.428
- Yeah, no, I'm
looking forward to that too.

772
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.229
- I hope so because I've got a

773
00:43:57.231 --> 00:43:59.565
special surprise for you when you get here.

774
00:43:59.567 --> 00:44:00.533
- Oh yeah?

775
00:44:01.201 --> 00:44:02.702
What is it?

776
00:44:02.704 --> 00:44:05.771
- If I told you,
it wouldn't be a surprise, dummy.

777
00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:07.073
Trust me, you'll like it.

778
00:44:07.075 --> 00:44:08.040
- Okay.

779
00:44:08.742 --> 00:44:09.976
- What about you?

780
00:44:09.978 --> 00:44:11.777
Bringing anything for me?

781
00:44:11.779 --> 00:44:13.746
- I don't know, maybe.

782
00:44:16.783 --> 00:44:18.217
- So are we
just gonna ignore the fact

783
00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:20.353
that you've got a second eye now, or...

784
00:44:20.355 --> 00:44:22.088
- I kept waiting for
you to ask about it.

785
00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.356
- I mean I
didn't wanna just bring it,

786
00:44:23.358 --> 00:44:26.158
I mean it seems like it'd be rude.

787
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.093
- No.

788
00:44:27.095 --> 00:44:29.261
- So what, was it surgery or...

789
00:44:29.263 --> 00:44:32.331
- No no no
no, it's just a prosthetic.

790
00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:34.400
- Oh, so like glass?

791
00:44:34.402 --> 00:44:37.803
- Plastic acrylic is what they call it.

792
00:44:39.606 --> 00:44:40.573
- Cool.

793
00:44:41.308 --> 00:44:42.475
- I mean how does it look?

794
00:44:42.477 --> 00:44:44.043
- No, yeah, no,
it looks, yeah, it's good.

795
00:44:44.045 --> 00:44:45.511
Yeah, it's cool.

796
00:44:46.613 --> 00:44:47.580
- Good.

797
00:44:49.583 --> 00:44:53.352
- So how long
you gonna be gone for?

798
00:44:53.354 --> 00:44:54.653
- Just a week.

799
00:44:57.624 --> 00:45:01.394
This is part one of
our two part plan, so...

800
00:45:02.362 --> 00:45:03.996
- What's part two?

801
00:45:05.465 --> 00:45:07.266
- To move out there.

802
00:45:22.616 --> 00:45:26.185
All right, well thanks for the ride.

803
00:45:26.187 --> 00:45:27.853
- Hey man, have a safe trip.

804
00:45:27.855 --> 00:45:28.821
- Okay.

805
00:45:30.057 --> 00:45:31.023
See ya.

806
00:45:36.329 --> 00:45:38.798
- Hey Matt, wait a minute.

807
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.765
- Hmm?

808
00:45:43.637 --> 00:45:45.604
- When you see Jill...

809
00:45:47.774 --> 00:45:49.508
Tell her I'm sorry?

810
00:46:52.506 --> 00:46:53.873
- Hey stranger.

811
00:47:04.684 --> 00:47:05.618
Surprise.

812
00:47:28.675 --> 00:47:31.043
So I'm liking the new look.

813
00:47:32.078 --> 00:47:33.212
Is it glass?

814
00:47:34.681 --> 00:47:36.482
- Plastic acrylic.

815
00:47:36.484 --> 00:47:37.449
- Mmmm.

816
00:47:38.451 --> 00:47:40.019
It looks really good.

817
00:47:40.021 --> 00:47:41.320
Very lifelike.

818
00:47:50.363 --> 00:47:52.064
I took a bunch of pictures before I

819
00:47:52.066 --> 00:47:55.734
started and been sending you those.

820
00:47:55.736 --> 00:47:59.071
In case you were
wondering why doesn't it match.

821
00:48:04.344 --> 00:48:05.311
So...

822
00:48:07.948 --> 00:48:08.881
What do you think?

823
00:48:08.883 --> 00:48:11.450
- You're gonna miss your turn.

824
00:48:13.987 --> 00:48:14.954
- Thanks.

825
00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.792
Science building, math building, art studio

826
00:48:19.794 --> 00:48:22.428
is back there as
well as the music studio.

827
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.662
That's where I've been spending

828
00:48:23.664 --> 00:48:25.931
most of my time,
where all my classes are.

829
00:48:25.933 --> 00:48:27.466
I'm all stocked up on music electives,

830
00:48:27.468 --> 00:48:29.702
but I'm gonna be fucked senior year

831
00:48:29.704 --> 00:48:30.970
when I have to fulfill the ones

832
00:48:30.972 --> 00:48:33.806
I'm supposed to, but living in the moment.

833
00:48:33.808 --> 00:48:35.808
- Spin man, spin spin spin spin spin!

834
00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.042
- Come on pat, you got this guy!

835
00:48:37.044 --> 00:48:38.410
- Come on man, you got this!

836
00:48:38.412 --> 00:48:39.945
Come on, come on!

837
00:48:41.114 --> 00:48:43.482
Go baby, come on, come on!

838
00:48:43.484 --> 00:48:45.718
You got him, you got him!

839
00:48:48.054 --> 00:48:50.256
Come on, come on, go, go!

840
00:48:51.891 --> 00:48:53.158
- Go baby, come on!

841
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.159
- All right man, chug it, chug it!

842
00:48:54.161 --> 00:48:55.527
- Come on!

843
00:48:55.529 --> 00:48:56.362
Man, you got it!

844
00:48:56.364 --> 00:48:57.429
- Come on!

845
00:48:57.431 --> 00:48:58.964
Come on, jabroni!

846
00:49:00.066 --> 00:49:01.967
You got it, you got it, swing it.

847
00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:03.068
Bam!

848
00:49:05.706 --> 00:49:07.106
- In your face!

849
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:10.609
Oh my god, that's some goodness.

850
00:49:12.512 --> 00:49:14.513
- You see something you like?

851
00:49:14.515 --> 00:49:15.914
- What?

852
00:49:15.916 --> 00:49:19.084
No no, I just, 
I know that girl.

853
00:49:19.086 --> 00:49:21.120
She went to my high
school for a little bit.

854
00:49:21.122 --> 00:49:22.755
- You should've brought
her to the cattle call.

855
00:49:22.757 --> 00:49:26.225
That ass alone will
put us over the top.

856
00:49:32.932 --> 00:49:34.166
- Hey!

857
00:49:34.168 --> 00:49:35.167
- Hi!

858
00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:39.705
- Okay everyone, everyone, okay, this is Matt.

859
00:49:39.707 --> 00:49:40.539
- Hi Matt.

860
00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:41.473
- Hi.

861
00:49:41.475 --> 00:49:43.942
- James, Sarah, Rachel, Andy.

862
00:49:45.211 --> 00:49:46.812
- James, Rachel, Andy?

863
00:49:46.814 --> 00:49:47.913
- Rachel, yes.

864
00:49:47.915 --> 00:49:48.847
- Got it.

865
00:49:48.849 --> 00:49:49.748
I'm Matt, nice to meet you.

866
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:50.849
- Nice to meet you.

867
00:49:52.753 --> 00:49:54.653
- I have to run,
so I'll see you guys later.

868
00:49:54.655 --> 00:49:55.621
- Okay, I'll see you later.

869
00:49:55.623 --> 00:49:56.855
- See you later!

870
00:49:56.857 --> 00:49:58.324
- I have a good
one if nobody else gets it.

871
00:49:58.326 --> 00:49:59.391
- The graveyard.

872
00:49:59.393 --> 00:50:00.726
- Ewww!

873
00:50:00.728 --> 00:50:01.827
- That is bullshit.

874
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:03.362
- No, that is absolutely true, in fact

875
00:50:03.364 --> 00:50:05.864
my first kiss was in a graveyard.

876
00:50:05.866 --> 00:50:07.399
- On whose grave?

877
00:50:08.501 --> 00:50:09.935
- Priscilla sears.

878
00:50:09.937 --> 00:50:11.370
- Okay, i have a better one,

879
00:50:11.372 --> 00:50:13.238
I have a better one,
i have a better one.

880
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.807
Okay, it wasn't sex, but I did

881
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:16.775
get a handjob in a grandfather clock.

882
00:50:16.777 --> 00:50:17.910
- Oh my god.

883
00:50:18.845 --> 00:50:20.379
How is that possible?

884
00:50:20.381 --> 00:50:21.780
- It was a large grandfather clock.

885
00:50:21.782 --> 00:50:22.981
- A large grandfather clock.

886
00:50:22.983 --> 00:50:24.483
- It was like imagine the size--

887
00:50:24.485 --> 00:50:25.651
- can I just tell
you what I'm imagining right now?

888
00:50:25.653 --> 00:50:27.252
- Please, yeah.

889
00:50:27.254 --> 00:50:28.654
- So it's just like here's this

890
00:50:28.656 --> 00:50:30.622
grandfather clock and you're inside it?

891
00:50:30.624 --> 00:50:31.557
- Yeah.

892
00:50:31.559 --> 00:50:32.758
- She's just outside it?

893
00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:33.425
- No, we're both inside it!

894
00:50:33.427 --> 00:50:34.259
I'm a gentleman.

895
00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:39.131
- That's some bullshit.

896
00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:40.699
- Grandfather clock though.

897
00:50:40.701 --> 00:50:42.101
- Do I win, do I win?

898
00:50:42.103 --> 00:50:44.269
- I don't know, does grandfather clock.

899
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:45.871
- Hey, hey, how about her?

900
00:50:45.873 --> 00:50:46.839
- Which one?

901
00:50:46.841 --> 00:50:48.440
- The blonde girl, white shirt.

902
00:50:48.442 --> 00:50:49.942
- Nah, too thing.

903
00:50:49.944 --> 00:50:51.076
- All right.

904
00:50:52.278 --> 00:50:54.346
Oh, oh, what about her?

905
00:50:55.415 --> 00:50:58.884
In the, what you call them, the jeggings.

906
00:50:58.886 --> 00:51:00.219
- Are you kidding me?

907
00:51:00.221 --> 00:51:01.653
- What?

908
00:51:01.655 --> 00:51:03.822
- Seriously, she's completely normal.

909
00:51:03.824 --> 00:51:04.990
- That's normal?

910
00:51:04.992 --> 00:51:06.058
- Yeah.

911
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.259
- That's normal?

912
00:51:07.261 --> 00:51:08.761
- Yes it is.

913
00:51:08.763 --> 00:51:11.363
- Okay, maybe back in
Wisconsin with the farm girls--

914
00:51:11.365 --> 00:51:13.332
- dude, I'm from Rhode Island.

915
00:51:13.334 --> 00:51:15.634
- All right, well whatever, man.

916
00:51:15.636 --> 00:51:17.369
You tell me then.

917
00:51:17.371 --> 00:51:19.805
What are we looking for, huh?

918
00:51:19.807 --> 00:51:20.773
What?

919
00:51:31.284 --> 00:51:33.619
- It's so nice, is
it like this every day?

920
00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:34.787
- Yes.

921
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:37.456
That's why I love it here.

922
00:51:44.731 --> 00:51:45.697
- Thanks.

923
00:51:48.802 --> 00:51:51.270
- Okay, so I have
no way to prove it,

924
00:51:51.272 --> 00:51:52.938
but I'm pretty sure the mirror in the

925
00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.907
bathroom is one of those two-sided

926
00:51:54.909 --> 00:51:56.442
mirrors you see in cop shows.

927
00:51:56.444 --> 00:51:57.676
- No way.

928
00:51:57.678 --> 00:52:00.412
- Yes, because i could see a figure.

929
00:52:02.115 --> 00:52:02.981
- Thank you.

930
00:52:02.983 --> 00:52:04.349
You could what?

931
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:06.418
- What is this?

932
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.352
- Hmm?

933
00:52:09.022 --> 00:52:10.622
- When did you order these?

934
00:52:10.624 --> 00:52:13.325
- While you were in the restroom.

935
00:52:13.327 --> 00:52:15.461
- I told you i didn't want dessert.

936
00:52:15.463 --> 00:52:17.663
- Yeah, I know, 
I just thought

937
00:52:17.665 --> 00:52:19.131
I haven't seen you in a while,

938
00:52:19.133 --> 00:52:20.999
so I thought we should celebrate.

939
00:52:21.001 --> 00:52:24.536
- Right, but I told
you I didn't want any.

940
00:52:24.538 --> 00:52:26.472
- Oh come on, just
have some ice cream with me.

941
00:52:26.474 --> 00:52:27.306
- I'm good.

942
00:52:27.308 --> 00:52:28.540
- I'm paying.

943
00:52:29.676 --> 00:52:30.709
- I'm good.

944
00:52:35.482 --> 00:52:36.715
- You know that's all I could

945
00:52:36.717 --> 00:52:37.916
think about on the plane down here?

946
00:52:37.918 --> 00:52:39.418
- What, taking a baseball bat to the

947
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.453
tiny shred of willpower I've developed?

948
00:52:41.455 --> 00:52:44.756
- No, just buying you meals and stuff.

949
00:52:46.493 --> 00:52:48.060
'Cause you always did the buying before.

950
00:52:48.062 --> 00:52:50.896
- My parents did the
buying, it was their credit card.

951
00:52:50.898 --> 00:52:52.397
- Well I finally saved up some money

952
00:52:52.399 --> 00:52:54.666
and I've been working like you wouldn't believe.

953
00:52:54.668 --> 00:52:55.968
I just thought it would be nice

954
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.236
to take you out for a meal and--

955
00:52:57.238 --> 00:52:58.904
- hey, you can pay for the dinner.

956
00:52:58.906 --> 00:53:00.138
- A salad?

957
00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.607
What is that, come
on, that's not a meal.

958
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:03.275
- It had chicken on it, that's protein.

959
00:53:03.277 --> 00:53:04.476
That makes it a meal.

960
00:53:04.478 --> 00:53:06.178
- Wow, you actually just said that.

961
00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.647
- What is so
horrible about having a salad?

962
00:53:08.649 --> 00:53:09.882
- Nothing, it's fine.

963
00:53:09.884 --> 00:53:11.016
You know what, don't
eat it, I don't care.

964
00:53:11.018 --> 00:53:11.950
Watch it melt.

965
00:53:11.952 --> 00:53:12.784
- Jill.

966
00:53:14.221 --> 00:53:15.087
- Hi.

967
00:53:15.089 --> 00:53:16.388
- Hi.

968
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:17.523
How are you?

969
00:53:20.059 --> 00:53:20.993
- Pretty good.

970
00:53:20.995 --> 00:53:23.328
- Yeah, I'd say pretty good.

971
00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.663
- Thank you.

972
00:53:24.665 --> 00:53:26.031
Thanks.

973
00:53:26.033 --> 00:53:27.566
- You look great.

974
00:53:29.002 --> 00:53:29.835
- Thank you.

975
00:53:29.837 --> 00:53:31.169
- You look really good.

976
00:53:31.171 --> 00:53:33.071
- Carl, this is my boyfriend Matt.

977
00:53:33.073 --> 00:53:33.906
- Hi.

978
00:53:33.908 --> 00:53:34.740
- How you doing?

979
00:53:34.742 --> 00:53:35.941
- Nice to meet you.

980
00:53:35.943 --> 00:53:37.843
- So wow, wow.

981
00:53:37.845 --> 00:53:38.777
- Yeah.

982
00:53:38.779 --> 00:53:40.579
- We should get together.

983
00:53:40.581 --> 00:53:42.447
Get some coffee or...

984
00:53:43.983 --> 00:53:44.816
Something.

985
00:53:44.818 --> 00:53:45.984
- Possibly, yeah.

986
00:53:45.986 --> 00:53:47.119
- You got my number?

987
00:53:47.121 --> 00:53:47.953
- I must.

988
00:53:47.955 --> 00:53:48.954
- I want you to call me.

989
00:53:48.956 --> 00:53:49.788
- Okay.

990
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:50.622
- Okay?

991
00:53:50.624 --> 00:53:51.456
- Okay.

992
00:53:54.295 --> 00:53:55.527
- Wow, you look great.

993
00:53:55.529 --> 00:53:58.063
- Thank you, thanks, i appreciate that.

994
00:53:58.065 --> 00:53:59.264
- Yeah, okay.

995
00:53:59.266 --> 00:54:01.300
Nice to meet you, mark.

996
00:54:20.687 --> 00:54:21.820
- It's good.

997
00:54:21.822 --> 00:54:23.221
Good ice cream.

998
00:54:24.824 --> 00:54:25.791
Happy?

999
00:54:48.014 --> 00:54:49.448
Oh my god, I cannot

1000
00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.749
believe that she looks like that.

1001
00:54:50.751 --> 00:54:52.050
I know, I really--

1002
00:54:52.052 --> 00:54:53.318
- guys, I'm just

1003
00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.753
saying her ass is the size of Texas.

1004
00:54:54.755 --> 00:54:57.222
- Well it's the size.

1005
00:55:01.594 --> 00:55:03.261
I'm doing this thing where I eat

1006
00:55:03.263 --> 00:55:06.031
cheese and have a piece of salad.

1007
00:55:06.033 --> 00:55:07.232
Then I run--

1008
00:55:07.234 --> 00:55:08.500
- I just wanna burn the calories,

1009
00:55:08.502 --> 00:55:09.868
I don't wanna do it,
i don't wanna do it.

1010
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.103
Okay, okay, hold on.

1011
00:55:11.105 --> 00:55:12.738
So what did he say
when you found the condoms,

1012
00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.741
or I should say the dearth of condoms?

1013
00:55:15.743 --> 00:55:17.242
They broke up for three
days and when they got

1014
00:55:17.244 --> 00:55:19.544
back together, four of them were missing.

1015
00:55:19.546 --> 00:55:20.946
- Woof.

1016
00:55:20.948 --> 00:55:22.080
- He said he likes

1017
00:55:22.082 --> 00:55:23.348
to jerk off into them.

1018
00:55:24.752 --> 00:55:25.951
Please tell me you did

1019
00:55:25.953 --> 00:55:27.285
not fuck him after you got back together.

1020
00:55:27.287 --> 00:55:30.155
- I mean I saw him and things...

1021
00:55:30.157 --> 00:55:31.957
- All right, look, we're going

1022
00:55:31.959 --> 00:55:33.592
to a party ad bel air's tonight.

1023
00:55:33.594 --> 00:55:34.793
Join us, we'll find you a guy.

1024
00:55:34.795 --> 00:55:35.727
- Ben says he

1025
00:55:35.729 --> 00:55:37.262
thinks we can make this work.

1026
00:55:37.264 --> 00:55:38.997
- Fuck that psion-driving douche.

1027
00:55:38.999 --> 00:55:40.532
You're young and hot, what the fuck

1028
00:55:40.534 --> 00:55:42.167
do you wanna be tied
down to a guy for?

1029
00:55:42.169 --> 00:55:43.402
This is college.

1030
00:55:43.404 --> 00:55:44.870
- I know, I just--

1031
00:55:44.872 --> 00:55:47.172
- all right, you
think you love this guy?

1032
00:55:47.174 --> 00:55:49.141
Okay, let's say he's being honest,

1033
00:55:49.143 --> 00:55:51.343
let's say he's turned
over a new leaf and

1034
00:55:51.345 --> 00:55:54.046
you guys find a way
to make it work or whatever.

1035
00:55:54.048 --> 00:55:55.814
Ask yourself this one question.

1036
00:55:55.816 --> 00:55:57.215
Do you really wanna
go the rest of your

1037
00:55:57.217 --> 00:55:59.918
life wondering if you could've done better?

1038
00:56:22.175 --> 00:56:23.375
- Hey.

1039
00:56:23.377 --> 00:56:24.743
- What's this?

1040
00:56:24.745 --> 00:56:26.211
You made dinner?

1041
00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:28.947
- Yeah.

1042
00:56:30.216 --> 00:56:32.484
It's a special recipe i
picked up at the restaurant.

1043
00:56:32.486 --> 00:56:34.019
I figured it's our last night here,

1044
00:56:34.021 --> 00:56:36.221
and we've been eating out all week, so...

1045
00:56:36.223 --> 00:56:38.824
- Uh-huh, and what's in it?

1046
00:56:38.826 --> 00:56:40.058
You know I've been--

1047
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.660
- well it's gluten free and dairy free.

1048
00:56:41.662 --> 00:56:43.495
It's all appropriate.

1049
00:56:43.497 --> 00:56:44.796
- All right.

1050
00:56:44.798 --> 00:56:46.331
Let me just take out the trash.

1051
00:56:46.333 --> 00:56:47.165
I got it.

1052
00:56:47.167 --> 00:56:48.366
- I can get it.

1053
00:56:48.368 --> 00:56:49.601
- You made dinner, 
I'll take out the trash.

1054
00:56:49.603 --> 00:56:50.402
- Jill, come on,
just let me do it.

1055
00:56:50.404 --> 00:56:51.536
Really, let me do it.

1056
00:56:51.538 --> 00:56:52.771
- No, it's a habit.

1057
00:56:52.773 --> 00:56:54.005
Can you not?

1058
00:56:54.007 --> 00:56:56.641
- It's the least
i can do, come on.

1059
00:56:58.111 --> 00:56:59.377
- Dairy free huh?

1060
00:56:59.379 --> 00:57:00.912
- Here, just let me...

1061
00:57:00.914 --> 00:57:03.715
- What part of "I'm on
a diet" do you not understand?

1062
00:57:03.717 --> 00:57:06.351
Okay, seriously dude, heavy cream?

1063
00:57:06.353 --> 00:57:07.586
Are you kidding me?

1064
00:57:07.588 --> 00:57:08.820
- Those are the ingredients, that's what

1065
00:57:08.822 --> 00:57:10.956
goes into it, it's not a big deal.

1066
00:57:10.958 --> 00:57:12.057
- Oh really?

1067
00:57:12.059 --> 00:57:13.125
- It's no big deal.

1068
00:57:13.127 --> 00:57:14.192
- No big deal, huh?

1069
00:57:14.194 --> 00:57:15.393
Okay, do you realize this is one

1070
00:57:15.395 --> 00:57:17.496
of the hardest things I've ever done?

1071
00:57:17.498 --> 00:57:19.097
Do you even realize how--

1072
00:57:19.099 --> 00:57:20.332
- oh my god, you run around in

1073
00:57:20.334 --> 00:57:21.933
circles once a day,
how hard can that be?

1074
00:57:21.935 --> 00:57:22.901
- What?

1075
00:57:25.772 --> 00:57:28.607
- Hold on, just, here, just taste it.

1076
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:30.108
Here, just try it, just try it.

1077
00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.243
Just have a taste.

1078
00:57:31.245 --> 00:57:32.177
- Oh my god, no.

1079
00:57:32.179 --> 00:57:33.178
- Please, then we'll talk.

1080
00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.446
- Just try it, just taste it!

1081
00:57:34.448 --> 00:57:35.447
- Fuck you!

1082
00:57:35.449 --> 00:57:36.414
Seriously!

1083
00:57:38.751 --> 00:57:40.986
- Fucking eat it, eat it!

1084
00:57:54.066 --> 00:57:55.634
- Jill, hey Jill!

1085
00:57:56.736 --> 00:57:57.702
Jill!

1086
00:58:02.241 --> 00:58:03.208
Jill!

1087
00:58:03.976 --> 00:58:05.377
Jill, Jill, listen!

1088
00:58:05.379 --> 00:58:07.579
- Get out of here, go!

1089
00:58:07.581 --> 00:58:11.049
- Please just tell
me what you want, Jill!

1090
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:12.284
- What I want?

1091
00:58:12.286 --> 00:58:14.119
You want me to
tell you what I want?

1092
00:58:14.121 --> 00:58:15.487
I want you to get
your ass on a fucking

1093
00:58:15.489 --> 00:58:16.922
plane and go back
to Rhode Island and never

1094
00:58:16.924 --> 00:58:20.792
fucking talk to me
again, that's what I want!

1095
00:58:20.794 --> 00:58:23.061
- You know, you'll
never be one of them.

1096
00:58:23.063 --> 00:58:23.895
- What?

1097
00:58:23.897 --> 00:58:25.096
- You know that right?

1098
00:58:25.098 --> 00:58:27.399
Even if you wanted to be.

1099
00:58:27.401 --> 00:58:29.367
Even if they want you
to be, which they don't.

1100
00:58:29.369 --> 00:58:31.303
- Said the guy with the glass eye!

1101
00:58:31.305 --> 00:58:34.773
Oh, my bad, sorry, "plastic acrylic".

1102
00:58:34.775 --> 00:58:36.241
- Hey fuck you!

1103
00:58:36.243 --> 00:58:38.343
- You know what, actually, stop
me if you've heard this one.

1104
00:58:38.345 --> 00:58:40.045
Some bitch walks up Winston Churchill at a

1105
00:58:40.047 --> 00:58:43.682
party and says Mr. 
Churchill, you're drunk.

1106
00:58:43.684 --> 00:58:47.452
To which Churchill replies
yes, but in the morning

1107
00:58:47.454 --> 00:58:50.856
I'll be sober and you'll still be ugly.

1108
00:58:52.391 --> 00:58:56.628
I keep doing what I'm
doing, and eventually I'll be thin.

1109
00:58:56.630 --> 00:59:00.932
And at the end of
the day, you'll still be deformed.

1110
00:59:02.468 --> 00:59:04.436
It's a great word, isn't it?

1111
00:59:04.438 --> 00:59:06.104
Deformed?

1112
00:59:06.106 --> 00:59:07.572
Such a you word.

1113
00:59:08.941 --> 00:59:11.877
You know, you'll also still be an idiot

1114
00:59:11.879 --> 00:59:14.713
by the way, I
mean wow, great plan, patton!

1115
00:59:14.715 --> 00:59:16.948
One fatty meal, 50 pounds

1116
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:19.517
is gonna leap back on me, wow!

1117
00:59:19.519 --> 00:59:20.986
- You lied to me.

1118
00:59:20.988 --> 00:59:23.655
- I didn't lie to you, 
I just didn't tell you about it.

1119
00:59:23.657 --> 00:59:25.056
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1120
00:59:25.058 --> 00:59:27.259
- That's a lie, that's, what's the word,

1121
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:29.895
equivocating, which is basically exactly the same thing!

1122
00:59:29.897 --> 00:59:31.897
- Actually no, it's not because this doesn't

1123
00:59:31.899 --> 00:59:34.232
negatively impact you in any way, okay?

1124
00:59:34.234 --> 00:59:35.934
Tell me what's wrong with what I'm doing.

1125
00:59:35.936 --> 00:59:39.504
- 'Cause you're a fucking fatass, okay?

1126
00:59:39.506 --> 00:59:42.274
And I like that about you.

1127
00:59:42.276 --> 00:59:43.775
I like that the only guys I'm competing

1128
00:59:43.777 --> 00:59:45.710
against are elderly degenerates and

1129
00:59:45.712 --> 00:59:47.812
guys that sickens me
to think of you with,

1130
00:59:47.814 --> 00:59:49.047
but the rest of the world wouldn't

1131
00:59:49.049 --> 00:59:50.415
touch with a 10 foot pole, and you

1132
00:59:50.417 --> 00:59:51.516
shouldn't be able to change all

1133
00:59:51.518 --> 00:59:54.319
that without fucking telling me!

1134
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.261
- You have a beautiful day.

1135
01:00:12.238 --> 01:00:13.204
- Fuck!

1136
01:00:57.249 --> 01:00:58.116
- Hey.

1137
01:00:58.118 --> 01:00:59.751
- Hey.

1138
01:00:59.753 --> 01:01:02.754
- I'm just looking for a jump rope.

1139
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:05.724
- They're over there.

1140
01:01:05.726 --> 01:01:06.958
- Oh, thanks.

1141
01:01:21.941 --> 01:01:23.908
Hey, don't I know you?

1142
01:01:26.178 --> 01:01:29.481
I mean were you a
student at Benjamin frank high?

1143
01:01:29.483 --> 01:01:31.950
A transfer student or whatever?

1144
01:01:31.952 --> 01:01:33.251
- Yeah, I was.

1145
01:01:34.854 --> 01:01:36.354
- Yeah.

1146
01:01:36.356 --> 01:01:39.257
Yeah, I helped you with
your books that one time.

1147
01:01:39.259 --> 01:01:40.692
You dropped them.

1148
01:01:40.694 --> 01:01:41.793
- Uh-huh.

1149
01:01:41.795 --> 01:01:43.228
- Yeah.

1150
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:47.365
- After your friends knocked
them out of my hands?

1151
01:01:53.406 --> 01:01:56.541
- So you like working out down here?

1152
01:01:57.443 --> 01:01:59.644
- It's all right.

1153
01:01:59.646 --> 01:02:01.179
- Yeah.

1154
01:02:01.181 --> 01:02:04.816
I mean it can get
pretty busy upstairs sometimes, you know.

1155
01:02:04.818 --> 01:02:06.217
I've had to wait
10 minutes to get on

1156
01:02:06.219 --> 01:02:08.653
a treadmill before, it's crazy right?

1157
01:02:08.655 --> 01:02:10.121
- If you say so.

1158
01:02:13.759 --> 01:02:17.896
- Hey, look, I don't
know what your plans are tonight.

1159
01:02:17.898 --> 01:02:19.197
Me and some buddies were thinking of

1160
01:02:19.199 --> 01:02:22.133
throwing a little party over the frat house.

1161
01:02:22.135 --> 01:02:23.401
I don't know what you
got going on, but I

1162
01:02:23.403 --> 01:02:27.238
was thinking that maybe
you'd like to join us.

1163
01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.573
I mean I know
we don't know each other

1164
01:02:28.575 --> 01:02:29.607
very well or anything, but it could

1165
01:02:29.609 --> 01:02:32.777
be nice to see a familiar face.

1166
01:02:32.779 --> 01:02:33.978
Hey, wait up.

1167
01:02:39.285 --> 01:02:40.251
Just, hey.

1168
01:02:41.821 --> 01:02:42.787
Hey.

1169
01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:47.158
So which dorm are you in, O'
Malley's, or I mean--

1170
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.761
- don't fucking touch me!

1171
01:02:49.763 --> 01:02:51.062
Okay, whatever it is you're doing

1172
01:02:51.064 --> 01:02:52.597
you can just stop right now.

1173
01:02:52.599 --> 01:02:54.065
- I'm not, I don't know what you're--

1174
01:02:54.067 --> 01:02:55.366
- I don't know what
you're up to, and I don't

1175
01:02:55.368 --> 01:02:58.069
wanna find out, so just
leave me the fuck alone.

1176
01:02:58.071 --> 01:03:01.406
- Okay, what makes you
think that I'm up to anything?

1177
01:03:01.408 --> 01:03:03.374
- Is that a joke?

1178
01:03:03.376 --> 01:03:04.809
- No.

1179
01:03:04.811 --> 01:03:06.044
- Some Abercrombie and
Fitch cover boy just strolls

1180
01:03:06.046 --> 01:03:07.245
up to the chubby girl doing laps in

1181
01:03:07.247 --> 01:03:09.747
the basement and asks her on a date?

1182
01:03:09.749 --> 01:03:11.116
Yeah, fuck that shit.

1183
01:03:11.118 --> 01:03:14.919
- Whoa, okay, first of
all, it's not a date.

1184
01:03:15.855 --> 01:03:16.821
I mean...

1185
01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:21.092
Okay, I was just asking if you

1186
01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:22.594
wanted to check out a really cool party.

1187
01:03:22.596 --> 01:03:23.528
- And I said no.

1188
01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:24.429
- But why?

1189
01:03:24.431 --> 01:03:25.363
I mean--

1190
01:03:25.365 --> 01:03:26.865
- because I don't want to.

1191
01:03:26.867 --> 01:03:28.032
- That's not an answer though.

1192
01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:29.868
- I don't have to give you one.

1193
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.102
- All right, but still, don't you

1194
01:03:31.104 --> 01:03:33.071
think it would be
the polite thing to do?

1195
01:03:33.073 --> 01:03:34.339
Just to show a little courtesy

1196
01:03:34.341 --> 01:03:35.807
to a guy who's going
out on a limb here?

1197
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:38.143
I mean be candor with me and--

1198
01:03:38.145 --> 01:03:40.445
- you want candor, fine.

1199
01:03:40.447 --> 01:03:41.679
You bore me.

1200
01:03:41.681 --> 01:03:42.881
- Okay.

1201
01:03:42.883 --> 01:03:44.082
- From your fucking pretty boy smile

1202
01:03:44.084 --> 01:03:45.550
to your shoes to your innermost thoughts

1203
01:03:45.552 --> 01:03:47.819
and feelings, have you listened to yourself talk?

1204
01:03:47.821 --> 01:03:51.022
"Oh I gotta wait 10
minutes for a treadmill," come on.

1205
01:03:51.024 --> 01:03:52.357
You know, I guess I
just have better things to

1206
01:03:52.359 --> 01:03:54.159
do on a Friday
night than play beer pong

1207
01:03:54.161 --> 01:03:57.695
with a bunch of date rapists in training.

1208
01:03:59.832 --> 01:04:00.798
- Wow.

1209
01:04:03.068 --> 01:04:06.271
Yeah, you have got me all wrong here.

1210
01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:11.743
I'm a nice guy, okay?

1211
01:04:14.046 --> 01:04:15.413
- I don't care.

1212
01:04:19.485 --> 01:04:20.451
- Okay.

1213
01:05:16.475 --> 01:05:18.476
- Hey, it's me.

1214
01:05:18.478 --> 01:05:21.246
Yeah, what are you doing tonight?

1215
01:05:21.248 --> 01:05:22.413
- Is he going out?

1216
01:05:22.415 --> 01:05:24.349
I don't know where he's going.

1217
01:05:24.351 --> 01:05:27.385
I don't know where he's going.

1218
01:05:27.387 --> 01:05:29.187
Where are you going?

1219
01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:33.258
I said where are you going.

1220
01:05:34.927 --> 01:05:36.761
Hello, am I talking
to a brick wall here?

1221
01:05:36.763 --> 01:05:37.595
Say something.

1222
01:05:37.597 --> 01:05:38.429
- Out, okay?

1223
01:05:38.431 --> 01:05:39.264
I'm going out.

1224
01:05:39.266 --> 01:05:40.732
- Where?

1225
01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:43.234
- Elmo's gonna pick me
up, we're just gonna drive around.

1226
01:05:43.236 --> 01:05:46.137
It's not a big deal, okay?

1227
01:05:46.139 --> 01:05:47.605
Have you seen my wallet anywhere?

1228
01:05:47.607 --> 01:05:48.640
- One second.

1229
01:05:48.642 --> 01:05:49.874
I'll be right back, honey.

1230
01:05:49.876 --> 01:05:53.245
- Huh?

1231
01:05:53.245 --> 01:05:56.948
- I'd rather you stay home tonight.

1232
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.150
Look, it sucks what you're going through.

1233
01:05:59.152 --> 01:06:00.385
I know that, i know it's the worst

1234
01:06:00.387 --> 01:06:01.586
feeling in the world and anything

1235
01:06:01.588 --> 01:06:02.854
I say is gonna sound like--

1236
01:06:02.856 --> 01:06:04.222
- damn it, where's my fucking wallet?

1237
01:06:04.224 --> 01:06:05.356
- Hey, are you listening to me?

1238
01:06:05.358 --> 01:06:06.824
- Yeah, I'm listening!

1239
01:06:06.826 --> 01:06:07.959
- I'm telling you I
think you should stay home!

1240
01:06:07.961 --> 01:06:09.160
- That was astoundingly like the advice

1241
01:06:09.162 --> 01:06:10.094
you gave me six months ago, and look

1242
01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:11.329
where that fucking got me, okay?

1243
01:06:11.331 --> 01:06:12.430
- I'm trying to help you.

1244
01:06:12.432 --> 01:06:13.564
- Help me?

1245
01:06:13.566 --> 01:06:14.932
Are you kidding me?

1246
01:06:14.934 --> 01:06:16.200
You're a single mother looking

1247
01:06:16.202 --> 01:06:17.535
around for her deadbeat ex-husband

1248
01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:18.836
trying to get child support, okay,

1249
01:06:18.838 --> 01:06:22.040
so don't help me, help yourself okay?

1250
01:06:23.575 --> 01:06:24.876
- All right, do what you want.

1251
01:06:24.878 --> 01:06:25.843
I'm done.

1252
01:06:28.514 --> 01:06:30.181
Hey honey.

1253
01:06:33.919 --> 01:06:34.752
- Hey.

1254
01:06:34.754 --> 01:06:35.720
- Hey.

1255
01:06:48.634 --> 01:06:50.134
Oh hey, a letter came for you,

1256
01:06:50.136 --> 01:06:51.903
somebody slipped it under the door.

1257
01:06:51.905 --> 01:06:54.972
It was on the
floor when I came in.

1258
01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:27.939
- That one there, that's him.

1259
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:29.073
Click on it.

1260
01:07:30.008 --> 01:07:31.209
Nice.

1261
01:07:31.211 --> 01:07:32.443
- He's handsome.

1262
01:07:32.445 --> 01:07:35.813
- He's too handsome, i wouldn't trust him.

1263
01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:39.917
- See, now why would you say that?

1264
01:07:39.919 --> 01:07:41.085
- Maybe he's a nice guy.

1265
01:07:41.087 --> 01:07:42.320
- Or maybe he really likes her.

1266
01:07:42.322 --> 01:07:43.588
- Based on what, he doesn't know her.

1267
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:45.957
- I don't know, how should I know?

1268
01:07:45.959 --> 01:07:47.392
I'm just saying it's possible.

1269
01:07:47.394 --> 01:07:48.860
- Yeah, you say
it's possible, and it's usually

1270
01:07:48.862 --> 01:07:52.163
not possible, do you
even know what tonight is?

1271
01:07:52.165 --> 01:07:54.298
- What's tonight?

1272
01:07:55.934 --> 01:07:57.668
- It's nothing.

1273
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:58.603
Never mind.

1274
01:07:58.605 --> 01:08:00.371
- No, tell me, what's tonight?

1275
01:08:00.373 --> 01:08:05.009
- It's nothing, 
I mean I'm just saying I wouldn't call him.

1276
01:08:05.011 --> 01:08:06.911
- Is it something...

1277
01:08:06.913 --> 01:08:07.745
- No.

1278
01:08:07.747 --> 01:08:09.013
Nerd.

1279
01:08:09.015 --> 01:08:10.448
- Why can't you tell me?

1280
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:13.918
- It's just, it's
this stupid thing fraternities do.

1281
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.220
- All right, well I guess
if it's nothing I can call him.

1282
01:08:16.222 --> 01:08:17.522
- It's just...

1283
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:28.433
Have you ever heard of the cattle call?

1284
01:08:56.094 --> 01:08:56.928
- What?

1285
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:57.995
What, what is it?

1286
01:08:57.997 --> 01:08:59.197
What did I do?

1287
01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:01.432
- I don't know, it's...

1288
01:09:01.434 --> 01:09:02.800
I don't feel like this is necessary.

1289
01:09:02.802 --> 01:09:05.136
- Necessary?

1290
01:09:05.138 --> 01:09:07.338
- Yeah, I mean...

1291
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.307
You're here, I'm here.

1292
01:09:10.108 --> 01:09:11.042
What's the hurry?

1293
01:09:11.044 --> 01:09:12.543
- I'm not in a hurry.

1294
01:09:12.545 --> 01:09:14.879
- Why do you keep doing it?

1295
01:09:14.881 --> 01:09:16.047
I just mean it's like every time

1296
01:09:16.049 --> 01:09:18.716
that we're together it's always...

1297
01:09:18.718 --> 01:09:20.618
- Because I like you.

1298
01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.021
I mean what do
you want me to say?

1299
01:09:24.023 --> 01:09:25.389
- You don't even know me.

1300
01:09:25.391 --> 01:09:26.424
- Yeah I do.

1301
01:09:26.426 --> 01:09:27.558
- Really?

1302
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.193
What do you know about me?

1303
01:09:29.195 --> 01:09:31.429
- Okay, I'm not doing this.

1304
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:33.397
- Okay, fine, I don't care.

1305
01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.732
- You're a fucking asshole.

1306
01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:37.201
- No, no I'm not, okay?

1307
01:09:37.203 --> 01:09:41.205
This is the kind
of shit I'm talking about.

1308
01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:42.740
I read.

1309
01:09:42.742 --> 01:09:44.642
I have thoughts, I...

1310
01:09:46.512 --> 01:09:49.447
I have an imagination, I go to

1311
01:09:49.449 --> 01:09:51.916
places that you don't even know.

1312
01:09:51.918 --> 01:09:53.384
I do things for people.

1313
01:09:53.386 --> 01:09:55.820
- Oh my god, you've
gotta be fucking kidding me.

1314
01:09:55.822 --> 01:09:57.388
- Because I care.

1315
01:10:00.025 --> 01:10:02.527
That's the kind of shit
that I want you to want

1316
01:10:02.529 --> 01:10:06.664
me for, that's what i
want you to know about me.

1317
01:10:10.335 --> 01:10:11.903
I'm a decent guy.

1318
01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:26.017
Wow.

1319
01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.387
You look...

1320
01:10:30.422 --> 01:10:31.389
Wow.

1321
01:10:33.158 --> 01:10:34.592
You ready to go?

1322
01:10:37.129 --> 01:10:38.095
Okay.

1323
01:10:39.765 --> 01:10:41.165
- Okay, you're gonna like them,

1324
01:10:41.167 --> 01:10:42.500
they're super cool, trust me, it's gonna be,

1325
01:10:42.502 --> 01:10:43.968
how much cash do you have on you?

1326
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:45.002
- Not a lot, why?

1327
01:10:45.004 --> 01:10:46.504
- Here, just take this.

1328
01:10:46.506 --> 01:10:48.005
Take that.

1329
01:10:48.007 --> 01:10:50.508
All right, the beer is
free, but the liquor costs

1330
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:52.076
money okay, so when you
offer to buy a girl

1331
01:10:52.078 --> 01:10:54.912
a drink, make sure you
pull out the whole wad.

1332
01:10:54.914 --> 01:10:56.180
Okay, let her see it.

1333
01:10:56.182 --> 01:10:57.481
- Why?

1334
01:10:57.483 --> 01:10:58.950
- So she knows you have deep pockets.

1335
01:10:58.952 --> 01:11:00.484
- Yeah, but I don't.

1336
01:11:00.486 --> 01:11:02.486
- Right, but she doesn't
even know that, all right?

1337
01:11:02.488 --> 01:11:05.656
They only see what
you want them to see.

1338
01:11:48.266 --> 01:11:49.600
Hey!

1339
01:11:49.602 --> 01:11:52.503
I got someone i need you to meet!

1340
01:11:54.473 --> 01:11:56.273
Hey, hey, Toni!

1341
01:11:56.275 --> 01:11:59.477
Toni, Toni, this is Matt, 
Matt, this is Toni.

1342
01:11:59.479 --> 01:12:02.380
Toni is in my women's
studies class and she's insane.

1343
01:12:02.382 --> 01:12:03.614
- Hi.

1344
01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:05.316
- So what's with the weird outfit?

1345
01:12:05.318 --> 01:12:07.018
- What, what do you mean?

1346
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.820
- Yeah, sorry, 
I forgot to tell him about the theme.

1347
01:12:09.822 --> 01:12:10.855
- What?

1348
01:12:10.857 --> 01:12:12.256
What theme?

1349
01:12:12.258 --> 01:12:13.791
- Boys will be girls night.

1350
01:12:13.793 --> 01:12:15.326
Yeah, I should've told you man, 
I'm sorry about that.

1351
01:12:15.328 --> 01:12:16.827
- How come you're not dressed up?

1352
01:12:16.829 --> 01:12:18.896
- Me, oh, I'm waiting for someone.

1353
01:12:18.898 --> 01:12:19.730
- Oooo!

1354
01:12:19.732 --> 01:12:20.865
- Shut up, shut up.

1355
01:12:20.867 --> 01:12:22.400
- Who?

1356
01:12:22.402 --> 01:12:24.869
- Just a friend, don't worry
about it, it's gonna be fine.

1357
01:12:24.871 --> 01:12:26.170
- Hey, just...

1358
01:12:26.972 --> 01:12:28.372
Be careful.

1359
01:12:28.374 --> 01:12:30.341
- All right, have fun!

1360
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:33.411
- Hey, I think
there's some extra boas upstairs.

1361
01:12:33.413 --> 01:12:36.714
Come with me, I'll get you in uniform.

1362
01:12:42.954 --> 01:12:45.222
- 236, ladies and gentlemen!

1363
01:12:48.628 --> 01:12:49.927
Who we got next?

1364
01:12:49.929 --> 01:12:51.729
Got you, come on up.

1365
01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:55.866
Aww, sweetie, don't be a sourpuss.

1366
01:12:55.868 --> 01:12:57.668
All right, who's up?

1367
01:13:03.175 --> 01:13:04.141
195, 195!

1368
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.813
- Jill?

1369
01:13:08.815 --> 01:13:10.816
- Huh?

1370
01:13:10.816 --> 01:13:14.185
- Do you want a beer or something?

1371
01:13:14.187 --> 01:13:15.152
- Yeah.

1372
01:13:17.989 --> 01:13:19.724
- What do you want?

1373
01:13:21.359 --> 01:13:22.727
- I don't care.

1374
01:13:24.896 --> 01:13:25.830
- What is it?

1375
01:13:25.832 --> 01:13:27.364
- For you.

1376
01:13:29.202 --> 01:13:30.167
Let's see.

1377
01:13:31.503 --> 01:13:32.803
- No, that's it.

1378
01:13:32.805 --> 01:13:34.004
No no no.

1379
01:13:34.006 --> 01:13:35.039
No, I don't want any of that please.

1380
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:35.973
- Oh yes you do.

1381
01:13:35.975 --> 01:13:37.208
- No, I'm really, I'm all set.

1382
01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:38.576
- Hey, just shut up
and let me do it.

1383
01:13:38.578 --> 01:13:39.877
You will look so good, you've already got

1384
01:13:39.879 --> 01:13:42.847
that semi-feminine thing going on anyway.

1385
01:13:42.849 --> 01:13:45.216
High cheek bones, you have big full lips.

1386
01:13:45.218 --> 01:13:46.617
This will be a cinch.

1387
01:13:46.619 --> 01:13:48.052
- No, I don't want that.

1388
01:13:48.054 --> 01:13:49.320
- Just trust me!

1389
01:13:49.322 --> 01:13:52.056
- Listen to me, 
I said i don't wanna do that!

1390
01:13:52.058 --> 01:13:53.691
- All right.

1391
01:13:53.693 --> 01:13:56.393
So what do you want to do then?

1392
01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:12.042
- Hey, Justin.

1393
01:14:12.044 --> 01:14:12.943
You made it, man.

1394
01:14:12.945 --> 01:14:14.578
- Hey there, uh...

1395
01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.313
- Elmo.

1396
01:14:16.315 --> 01:14:17.548
- Elmo, elmo.

1397
01:14:18.583 --> 01:14:20.751
- So did you find the place okay?

1398
01:14:20.753 --> 01:14:23.754
- Yeah, yeah, it was kinda...

1399
01:14:23.756 --> 01:14:25.923
What kind of party did
you say this was again?

1400
01:14:25.925 --> 01:14:29.326
- Oh, it's like a stupid costume party.

1401
01:14:30.962 --> 01:14:32.429
Normally I wouldn't be caught dead

1402
01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:35.566
in a place like this, too many fags.

1403
01:14:37.135 --> 01:14:39.703
But a boatload of theater chicks though right?

1404
01:14:39.705 --> 01:14:40.938
Tell you what, why don't I grab

1405
01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.774
your coat and get you some goose.

1406
01:14:43.776 --> 01:14:45.776
- You know, I think I'm just,

1407
01:14:45.778 --> 01:14:47.978
I think I'm gonna head out.

1408
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:52.316
This place is just a
little too wild for my tastes.

1409
01:14:52.318 --> 01:14:54.518
- Oh, yeah, no, I get it.

1410
01:14:55.587 --> 01:14:57.588
Tell you what, get you a drink--

1411
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:58.422
- it's all right.

1412
01:14:58.424 --> 01:14:59.523
- You sure?

1413
01:14:59.525 --> 01:15:01.292
You all right? 
- Yeah, I'll just, yeah.

1414
01:15:01.294 --> 01:15:03.460
- Okay, yeah, drive safe.

1415
01:15:12.204 --> 01:15:13.370
Justin!

1416
01:15:20.912 --> 01:15:22.780
- Hey, do you
know where the bathroom is?

1417
01:15:22.782 --> 01:15:24.248
- Oh shit, it's you.

1418
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:25.749
Patrick keever huh?

1419
01:15:25.751 --> 01:15:26.951
- What?

1420
01:15:26.953 --> 01:15:28.719
- I heard dude, he's a fucking stud.

1421
01:15:28.721 --> 01:15:29.854
I'm jealous.

1422
01:15:30.856 --> 01:15:32.323
- Who are you with?

1423
01:15:32.325 --> 01:15:34.558
- Fabio, he's the sexy
Latin dude taking the photos.

1424
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.893
He's got his own name tattooed on

1425
01:15:35.895 --> 01:15:37.261
his back and he's already misused the

1426
01:15:37.263 --> 01:15:39.964
word pedantic twice in conversation tonight.

1427
01:15:39.966 --> 01:15:41.465
But fuck it, he's on the rowing team

1428
01:15:41.467 --> 01:15:44.168
and he's got biceps like softballs.

1429
01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:45.769
So who gives a shit right?

1430
01:15:45.771 --> 01:15:47.738
But yeah, Patrick.

1431
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:48.873
You're a lucky girl.

1432
01:15:48.875 --> 01:15:51.408
Got a fun night ahead of you.

1433
01:15:53.545 --> 01:15:56.313
- Look, I gotta
talk to you about something.

1434
01:15:56.315 --> 01:15:58.148
- Why do they all wear solid black?

1435
01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:00.217
I mean whatever happened to vertical stripes right?

1436
01:16:02.355 --> 01:16:04.822
- I don't think I can do this.

1437
01:16:04.824 --> 01:16:06.390
- What?

1438
01:16:06.392 --> 01:16:08.192
What are you talking about?

1439
01:16:08.194 --> 01:16:09.960
You're one of my best pledges.

1440
01:16:09.962 --> 01:16:11.428
- Isn't there any other way?

1441
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.430
- You wanna leave, no
one's forcing you to be here.

1442
01:16:13.432 --> 01:16:14.899
- No, I know, it's just--

1443
01:16:14.901 --> 01:16:16.567
- more importantly, no one's
forcing her to be here.

1444
01:16:16.569 --> 01:16:18.636
She's not stupid, she knows what's going on.

1445
01:16:18.638 --> 01:16:20.437
Why do you think she
hasn't stormed out by now?

1446
01:16:20.439 --> 01:16:23.574
Why haven't all of them stormed out?

1447
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:27.144
- I don't know.

1448
01:16:27.146 --> 01:16:30.281
- Because they wanna fuck
a bunch of good looking dudes.

1449
01:16:30.283 --> 01:16:32.049
Are we exploiting them?

1450
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:33.517
Obviously.

1451
01:16:33.519 --> 01:16:35.719
Are they exploiting us right back?

1452
01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:36.954
You better believe it.

1453
01:16:36.956 --> 01:16:37.922
- Cheers.

1454
01:16:41.493 --> 01:16:44.228
- I'm not gonna fuck you.

1455
01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:46.063
- Wow, that's a relief.

1456
01:16:46.065 --> 01:16:49.233
- I'm just saying, you're not my type.

1457
01:16:49.235 --> 01:16:52.036
I figured we should get that
out of the way up front.

1458
01:16:52.038 --> 01:16:54.905
- Up front, you mean like
after I pay for your drink?

1459
01:16:54.907 --> 01:16:56.373
- It's nothing personal.

1460
01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:58.008
You're just too...

1461
01:16:59.244 --> 01:17:00.644
Normal.

1462
01:17:00.646 --> 01:17:01.578
- Normal.

1463
01:17:02.847 --> 01:17:04.048
Oh god, okay.

1464
01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.151
Of course, of course that's the reason.

1465
01:17:07.153 --> 01:17:08.118
- What?

1466
01:17:16.528 --> 01:17:17.494
Whoa.

1467
01:17:20.031 --> 01:17:22.666
- You want different, huh, you want weird?

1468
01:17:22.668 --> 01:17:24.335
There you go, it's all yours.

1469
01:17:24.337 --> 01:17:26.270
You know what, the
funny thing is I actually

1470
01:17:26.272 --> 01:17:28.272
don't disagree with you, 
I really don't.

1471
01:17:28.274 --> 01:17:29.740
I don't care what
the fuck you call me.

1472
01:17:29.742 --> 01:17:31.308
I just wish that
you guys, all you guys

1473
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:33.377
would just get together and agree on it

1474
01:17:33.379 --> 01:17:35.646
'cause I don't know
what the fuck I am.

1475
01:17:35.648 --> 01:17:38.716
And all these guys, they seem to know.

1476
01:17:38.718 --> 01:17:40.117
I mean they're here, they put on

1477
01:17:40.119 --> 01:17:41.552
this little uniform, and the only

1478
01:17:41.554 --> 01:17:43.253
reason I don't have mine on is because

1479
01:17:43.255 --> 01:17:45.723
this thing doesn't, it doesn't fit me.

1480
01:17:45.725 --> 01:17:46.957
And if it did, if there was something

1481
01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:50.260
I could wear or say or do, then...

1482
01:17:50.262 --> 01:17:53.797
Are you even listening to me right now?

1483
01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:56.066
I'm saying something to you.

1484
01:17:56.068 --> 01:17:58.502
- Shit, that is so fucking cool.

1485
01:17:58.504 --> 01:17:59.470
- Unbelievable.

1486
01:17:59.472 --> 01:18:00.471
- No, how did it happen?

1487
01:18:00.473 --> 01:18:01.405
You gotta tell me.

1488
01:18:01.407 --> 01:18:02.906
Actually wait, before you start.

1489
01:18:02.908 --> 01:18:04.208
Hey Andy!

1490
01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:06.143
Get over here, you've gotta see this!

1491
01:18:06.145 --> 01:18:07.111
- 204...

1492
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.482
205, ladies and gentlemen, 205!

1493
01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.453
All right, last up.

1494
01:18:17.956 --> 01:18:19.823
Hey tons of fun, come on.

1495
01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:21.959
Come on sweetie, it'll just
take a second, let's go.

1496
01:18:21.961 --> 01:18:24.161
- Don't fucking touch me.

1497
01:18:25.663 --> 01:18:26.830
- Come on, it's not gonna hurt.

1498
01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:27.664
Just get up.

1499
01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:28.599
- I said I didn't--

1500
01:18:28.601 --> 01:18:29.533
- just get on the scale.

1501
01:18:29.535 --> 01:18:30.734
- I'm not doing this, I don't--

1502
01:18:30.736 --> 01:18:33.103
- get your fucking hands off her!

1503
01:18:33.105 --> 01:18:33.937
You okay?

1504
01:18:33.939 --> 01:18:35.139
- Yeah.

1505
01:18:35.141 --> 01:18:36.407
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

1506
01:18:36.409 --> 01:18:37.908
I was just taking her on the scale.

1507
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:39.843
- She doesn't wanna get on
the scale, so do not touch her!

1508
01:18:39.845 --> 01:18:41.578
- She doesn't wanna get on the scale?

1509
01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.213
What are you, her
bodyguard all of a sudden?

1510
01:18:43.215 --> 01:18:44.848
- What's going on?

1511
01:18:45.884 --> 01:18:47.584
- She doesn't wanna get on the scale.

1512
01:18:47.586 --> 01:18:48.752
- So?

1513
01:18:48.754 --> 01:18:50.821
- So everyone else has,
so she has to now.

1514
01:18:50.823 --> 01:18:52.790
- She doesn't have to
do anything she doesn't wanna do.

1515
01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:54.958
This is supposed to be fun.

1516
01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.226
- Yeah, but everyone else has--

1517
01:18:56.228 --> 01:18:58.062
- I don't give
a shit about everyone else.

1518
01:18:58.064 --> 01:19:00.697
Only person I care about is...

1519
01:19:01.466 --> 01:19:02.299
What's your name?

1520
01:19:02.301 --> 01:19:03.767
- Jill.

1521
01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:05.335
- Beautiful name.

1522
01:19:07.405 --> 01:19:09.039
All that's important is that you have

1523
01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:12.342
a good time, isn't that right Patrick?

1524
01:19:13.611 --> 01:19:14.578
- Yeah.

1525
01:19:15.613 --> 01:19:16.647
- Upstairs.

1526
01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:22.119
Last door on the left.

1527
01:19:23.354 --> 01:19:25.255
- How did you know
I played basketball back then?

1528
01:19:25.257 --> 01:19:28.425
- Well we went to
the same high school remember?

1529
01:19:28.427 --> 01:19:30.294
- You went to Ben frank?

1530
01:19:30.296 --> 01:19:31.261
- Yeah.

1531
01:19:34.332 --> 01:19:35.466
Don't you remember there was that

1532
01:19:35.468 --> 01:19:37.301
one time we were in the hallway,

1533
01:19:37.303 --> 01:19:39.470
I was looking at the college placement board,

1534
01:19:39.472 --> 01:19:42.506
and you came up and I was like

1535
01:19:42.508 --> 01:19:44.274
hey look, we're going to the same school

1536
01:19:44.276 --> 01:19:47.578
and you said nice, 
I'll see you there.

1537
01:19:54.887 --> 01:19:56.854
You want another beer?

1538
01:20:38.329 --> 01:20:39.630
- No, that...

1539
01:20:39.632 --> 01:20:40.864
- Who is she?

1540
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.234
- She's, we were dating.

1541
01:20:47.372 --> 01:20:50.741
- Were dating, as
in you guys broke up?

1542
01:20:54.412 --> 01:20:55.712
- Not exactly.

1543
01:20:57.916 --> 01:20:58.882
- Right.

1544
01:20:59.817 --> 01:21:00.951
Not exactly.

1545
01:21:04.155 --> 01:21:06.957
How long have you been together?

1546
01:21:08.226 --> 01:21:09.860
- Year and a half.

1547
01:21:10.862 --> 01:21:14.431
We were trying the whole long distance thing.

1548
01:21:14.433 --> 01:21:15.432
- Oh really?

1549
01:21:15.434 --> 01:21:18.135
How's that working out for you?

1550
01:21:22.407 --> 01:21:24.041
That was another joke.

1551
01:21:24.043 --> 01:21:25.342
- Right, yeah.

1552
01:21:47.265 --> 01:21:48.599
- Oh god.

1553
01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:52.436
I'm such a shitty singer.

1554
01:21:52.438 --> 01:21:54.171
- Oh fuck, were you even listening?

1555
01:21:54.173 --> 01:21:55.839
Come on man, no, you're good. 
- You got a good voice.

1556
01:21:55.841 --> 01:21:58.008
- No, no, shut up, that's wrong.

1557
01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:59.376
- Fuck that, it's true.

1558
01:21:59.378 --> 01:22:01.745
- No man, it's not, 
I'm not gonna.

1559
01:22:01.747 --> 01:22:02.980
- Oh come on.

1560
01:22:03.915 --> 01:22:05.882
- Watch it, jeez.

1561
01:22:05.884 --> 01:22:06.950
Outta here.

1562
01:22:26.771 --> 01:22:27.804
Roker, huh?

1563
01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.908
You read him yet, he's good.

1564
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.543
He's kinda like...

1565
01:22:35.079 --> 01:22:36.546
What's his name?

1566
01:22:38.816 --> 01:22:39.783
Whatever.

1567
01:22:44.255 --> 01:22:47.457
There was this poet that my dad knew,

1568
01:22:48.559 --> 01:22:50.994
or knew someone who, I don't know,

1569
01:22:50.996 --> 01:22:54.231
but this guy, he was like, not famous

1570
01:22:56.467 --> 01:23:00.037
or anything, he was just unbearably ugly.

1571
01:23:02.607 --> 01:23:03.840
Like hideous.

1572
01:23:07.245 --> 01:23:10.547
And no woman would touch him, so he...

1573
01:23:17.221 --> 01:23:18.522
He tried guys.

1574
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:27.564
No guys would touch him.

1575
01:23:32.236 --> 01:23:34.504
So he tried hookers.

1576
01:23:47.452 --> 01:23:50.921
But none of them would touch him either.

1577
01:23:51.756 --> 01:23:53.457
- Take off your pants.

1578
01:23:53.459 --> 01:23:56.626
- Don't you wanna
just wait a little bit?

1579
01:23:56.628 --> 01:23:57.694
- For what?

1580
01:23:59.364 --> 01:24:00.964
- I don't know, just...

1581
01:24:00.966 --> 01:24:03.433
- Just take them off.

1582
01:24:03.435 --> 01:24:06.370
- Okay, just give me a minute.

1583
01:24:06.372 --> 01:24:09.506
- So one day he
went out to a store.

1584
01:24:16.981 --> 01:24:20.384
He bought one of those plastic revolvers.

1585
01:24:23.888 --> 01:24:26.056
And he took the little orange tip off,

1586
01:24:26.058 --> 01:24:29.426
the one that makes
you know it's a toy.

1587
01:24:31.763 --> 01:24:35.465
And he ran out
into traffic just waving it.

1588
01:24:39.570 --> 01:24:41.805
And the police came out and tackled him

1589
01:24:41.807 --> 01:24:43.440
and threw him on
the hood of the car.

1590
01:24:43.442 --> 01:24:45.175
- Is everything okay?

1591
01:24:45.177 --> 01:24:47.144
- Just a second, okay?

1592
01:24:50.415 --> 01:24:52.048
- I can help with something--

1593
01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:55.619
- no, I just, just
give me a minute okay?

1594
01:25:02.093 --> 01:25:04.561
- He said it felt wonderful.

1595
01:25:06.597 --> 01:25:08.732
Fuck, what was his name?

1596
01:25:12.904 --> 01:25:13.870
Justin?

1597
01:25:16.808 --> 01:25:17.774
Justin?

1598
01:25:18.943 --> 01:25:20.677
Yo dude, you awake?

1599
01:25:24.048 --> 01:25:26.683
- So still too normal to fuck?

1600
01:25:28.886 --> 01:25:29.853
- No.

1601
01:25:30.721 --> 01:25:31.788
Not normal.

1602
01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:34.257
Just...

1603
01:25:37.195 --> 01:25:38.161
Pathetic.

1604
01:25:47.572 --> 01:25:48.538
- Fucker.

1605
01:26:16.868 --> 01:26:17.834
- Hey.

1606
01:26:19.937 --> 01:26:22.572
Have a good night, sweetheart.

1607
01:27:50.962 --> 01:27:51.928
- Hey.

1608
01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:54.397
Wait, no no, hey, no, I'm sorry,

1609
01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:56.232
I thought you knew, i thought, you were

1610
01:27:56.234 --> 01:27:59.836
touching me, I just thought that you knew.

1611
01:27:59.838 --> 01:28:02.339
Oh god, please don't hate me.

1612
01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.174
I love you.

1613
01:28:23.694 --> 01:28:25.095
- Hello?

1614
01:28:26.697 --> 01:28:27.897
What?

1615
01:28:50.521 --> 01:28:51.588
- This way?

1616
01:28:53.557 --> 01:28:56.559
Hi, hey, excuse me, can you help me?

1617
01:28:56.561 --> 01:28:58.061
Excuse me?

1618
01:28:58.063 --> 01:28:59.029
Shit.

1619
01:29:00.031 --> 01:29:00.997
Excuse me!

1620
01:29:00.999 --> 01:29:02.098
Excuse me!

1621
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.033
- Sir?

1622
01:29:03.035 --> 01:29:04.234
- Hi, I have a friend here,

1623
01:29:04.236 --> 01:29:05.168
can you tell me where exactly he is?

1624
01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:06.369
- All right, I understand.

1625
01:29:06.371 --> 01:29:07.637
I'll be with you in
just a second, for right

1626
01:29:07.639 --> 01:29:09.939
now though, please stand behind the yellow line.

1627
01:29:09.941 --> 01:29:11.174
- No no no, you don't understand, please,

1628
01:29:11.176 --> 01:29:12.776
can you just tell me
which room he's in and--

1629
01:29:12.778 --> 01:29:14.711
- sir, behind the yellow line now.

1630

- Please, just--

1631
01:29:15.647 --> 01:29:16.813

1632
01:29:16.815 --> 01:29:18.114
- God, get off
the fucking phone, help me!

1633
01:29:18.116 --> 01:29:19.616

1634
01:29:19.618 --> 01:29:22.118

I'm over here.

- How are you?

1640
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.301
Did you take a red eye, or how--

1641
01:30:45.303 --> 01:30:49.506
- look, just do me a
favor and don't talk to me.

1642
01:30:49.508 --> 01:30:51.407
- Do you want
me to sit somewhere else?

1643
01:30:51.409 --> 01:30:52.675
- I don't care.

1644
01:30:52.677 --> 01:30:53.810
- You don't care, or you--

1645
01:30:53.812 --> 01:30:54.644
- just don't talk to me.

1646
01:30:54.646 --> 01:30:55.478
