00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:19.081
<i>All my life, I've lived
and worked in the big city,</i>


2
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:23.582
<i>which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,</i>


3
00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:26.881
<i>since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.</i>


4
00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:29.751
<i>I mean it. I have this fear
of enclosed spaces.</i>


5
00:01:29.845 --> 00:01:32.633
<i>I-I-I... Everything makes me
feel trapped all the time.</i>


6
00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:36.382
<i>I always tell myself there's gotta be
something better out there.</i>


7
00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:38.763
<i>But maybe I...
Maybe I think too much.</i>


8
00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:43.682
<i>I think everything must go back to the
fact that I had a very anxious childhood.</i>


9
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.939
You know, my mother
never had time for me.


10
00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:51.114
When you're the middle child
in a family of five million,


11
00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:53.156
you don't get any attention.

12
00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:54.404
I mean, how is it possible?

13
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:58.996
I've always had these abandonment issues
which plague me.


14
00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:01.665
My father was basically a drone,
like I've said.


15
00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:04.745
And, you know, the guy flew away
when I was just a larva.


16
00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:11.043
And my job, don't get me started on,
because it really annoys me.


17
00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:14.504
I-I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.


18
00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:17.136
I
-I
-I feel physically inadequate.

19
00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:20.514
My whole life,
I've never been able to lift


20
00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:22.596
more than 10 times my own body weight.

21
00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:27.233
And, when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know...


22
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.686
is not my idea of a rewarding career.

23
00:02:30.697 --> 00:02:33.986
It's this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing


24
00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:36.818
that... that, you know, I can't get.

25
00:02:36.912 --> 00:02:38.369
I try, but I don't get it.

26
00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:40.196
I mean, you know, I'm... What is it?

27
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.282
I'm supposed to do everything
for the colony.


28
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.118
And-And what about my needs?
What about me?


29
00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:48.542
I've gotta believe there's someplace
out there that's better than this.


30
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.799
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.


31
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.962
The whole system makes me feel...

32
00:02:57.682 --> 00:02:59.469
insignificant.

33
00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:00.974
Excellent.

34
00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:03.428
- You've made a real breakthrough.
- I have?


35
00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:06.306
Yes, Z. You are insignificant.

36
00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:07.606
I
-I am?

37
00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:21.408
Ground floor!

38
00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:50.276
Uh, worker.

39
00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:54.113
Soldier.

40
00:03:55.532 --> 00:03:56.773
Ooh.

41
00:03:57.158 --> 00:03:59.366
- Uh-oh.
- Worker.


42
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.291
Let's try it again.

43
00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:14.211
Firm grip. Swing hard.
Back straight. Concentrate.


44
00:04:14.718 --> 00:04:15.718
Follow through.

45
00:04:42.787 --> 00:04:44.744
Okay. I gotta keep a positive attitude.

46
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:47.699
A good attitude, even though
I'm utterly insignificant.


47
00:04:49.252 --> 00:04:51.995
I'm-I'm insignificant, um,
but with attitude.


48
00:04:53.757 --> 00:04:56.670
Ooh, sorry, Z.
I didn't see ya.


49
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.126
Great, Azteca.

50
00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.927
It's working already.
I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.


51
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.091
Now, you're getting it.

52
00:05:05.477 --> 00:05:09.096
After all, it's not about you.

53
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.056
It's about us! The team!

54
00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:15.104
It's about... this.

55
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:18.483
Uh, a giant hole in the ground?

56
00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.442
- Okay, people. Are we feeling good?
- Yeah!


57
00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:24.110
- Yeah.
- Great!


58
00:05:24.537 --> 00:05:29.703
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,
you guys are on wrecking ball.


59
00:05:29.793 --> 00:05:31.830
- You got it!
- Swell.


60
00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:34.015
- You got it!
- All right. Swing time.


61
00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:36.087
Let's get physical!
I love this job! Let's go!


62
00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:38.882
Now, remember, 
Azteca, "Be the ball."

63
00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.881
That's the main thing.
Now, remember that.


64
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:43.304
You know, gotta be one with the ball.

65
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.972
Would you cut it out already?

66
00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:48.635
Jeez. I love my work. 
And you, well...

67
00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:50.553
You think too much.

68
00:05:51.648 --> 00:05:55.141
Come on, Z.
Help us build a bigger, better colony.


69
00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:57.818
And, for cryin' out loud,
try to be happy about it.


70
00:05:58.238 --> 00:06:00.195
Sure, you know. 
I mean, why-why...

71
00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:03.149
How could I possibly be unhappy
being a piece of construction equipment?


72
00:06:03.243 --> 00:06:05.986
- Okay, workers, remember...
- Here it comes.


73
00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:08.488
...be the ball!

74
00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:11.366
Let the energy flow through you!

75
00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.918
Grin and bear it. This is...
This is for the colony.


76
00:06:20.677 --> 00:06:22.134
Ow. This is...

77
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.257
This is just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

78
00:06:24.347 --> 00:06:27.511
Hang on. Here we go. Higher! Faster!

79
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.638
Did I happen to mention that
heights make me nauseous?


80
00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:31.594
No.

81
00:06:31.688 --> 00:06:32.688
This is a ball!

82
00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:36.432
Hey!

83
00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:47.485
- Oh, Z.
- Yes. Yes. I understand.


84
00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:48.695
I dropped the ball.

85
00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:54.575
Workers. They're weak.

86
00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:58.167
They lack discipline.
They lack commitment.


87
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.924
General, I know there's been
a glitch or two.


88
00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:05.594
But everybody is working
full tilt as it is, and...


89
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:09.674
You can't help it, it's your nature.

90
00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:12.058
But in spite of your limitations,

91
00:07:12.145 --> 00:07:14.888
you are going to finish this tunnel
on schedule.


92
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.772
Come hell or high water.

93
00:07:16.858 --> 00:07:18.565
From now on, anyone who falls behind

94
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:21.018
is going to have to explain themselves
to Colonel Cutter.


95
00:07:21.738 --> 00:07:25.607
And let me assure you, the Colonel is not
as understanding as I am.


96
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:26.909
Dismissed.

97
00:07:30.038 --> 00:07:33.156
Four more days, Cutter. 
Four more days.

98
00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:37.327
And we can bid final farewell
to their kind of incompetence.


99
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.420
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:39.791
A fresh start.

101
00:07:40.882 --> 00:07:43.590
- Imagine it!
- A strong colony, sir.


102
00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:46.089
A colony we can be proud of.

103
00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:47.590
Yes, but we're not there yet.

104
00:07:48.765 --> 00:07:53.430
Cutter, we just got word that
a termite army has mobilized against us.


105
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520
Against us?

106
00:07:54.604 --> 00:07:59.065
We'll have to send troops deep into
hostile territory to attack their colony.


107
00:07:59.275 --> 00:08:02.768
Attack a termite colony, sir?
That's suicide.


108
00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:05.445
Exactly. Do you have
the list I asked for?

109
00:08:05.782 --> 00:08:07.068
Yes, General.

110
00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:11.319
These are the units loyal to the queen.

111
00:08:13.081 --> 00:08:14.081
Hm.

112
00:08:14.124 --> 00:08:15.911
Then they're the ones we'll be sending.

113
00:08:16.668 --> 00:08:18.876
It's a shame.
There are some fine officers here.


114
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.544
Don't we need the queen's approval
to declare war?


115
00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:25.124
Our very next stop, Cutter.

116
00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:30.634
General, we've been at peace
with that colony for years.


117
00:08:31.307 --> 00:08:33.890
- Why would they attack us?
- They want our land.


118
00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:36.514
They're desperate
for more foraging territory.


119
00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:39.267
Perhaps they think
we've grown soft or weak.


120
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:43.142
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty?


121
00:08:44.237 --> 00:08:46.399
Certainly, we don't need to send soldiers.

122
00:08:46.489 --> 00:08:47.730
Believe me.

123
00:08:47.824 --> 00:08:50.658
Every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.


124
00:08:52.787 --> 00:08:56.246
That's why we must strike now,
while we have the element of surprise.


125
00:08:56.624 --> 00:08:59.583
If the termite shock troops
enter our colony, well...


126
00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:03.629
Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.


127
00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:06.923
Very well.

128
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.626
You've made a wise decision.

129
00:09:09.137 --> 00:09:12.221
In fact, you've insured
the future of this colony.


130
00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:16.059
Hello, General.

131
00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:21.268
Princess Bala. 
What a nice surprise.

132
00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:23.223
You look lovelier each time I see you.

133
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.860
Thanks.

134
00:09:25.195 --> 00:09:28.029
I hope you're not just here on business.

135
00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:31.107
Oh, of course...
Of course not.


136
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:36.742
Because, um, it might be nice
if we had a conversation


137
00:09:37.498 --> 00:09:38.739
once before we get married.

138
00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:40.199
You're absolutely right.

139
00:09:40.293 --> 00:09:43.161
Cutter, schedule some private time
for me and Princess Bala.


140
00:09:43.796 --> 00:09:47.665
Uh, in fact, sir, there is time right now
for a personal moment.


141
00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:50.046
We're a few seconds ahead of schedule.

142
00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:52.219
Excellent. Princess.

143
00:09:52.305 --> 00:09:56.970
Well, a few seconds isn't much, but

144
00:09:57.435 --> 00:09:59.472
I guess if it's quality time...

145
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.393
So, how was your day?

146
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.354
- Anything interesting happen?
- We declared war.


147
00:10:07.195 --> 00:10:08.402
Declared war?

148
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:11.898
Boy, talk about a rough day.

149
00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:16.110
Sir, I hate to interrupt,
but time stands still for no ant.


150
00:10:16.412 --> 00:10:17.412
Princess.

151
00:10:23.419 --> 00:10:28.005
Mom, could you remind me,
why am I marrying this guy?


152
00:10:28.091 --> 00:10:30.925
Bala, do we have to argue
about this again?


153
00:10:31.427 --> 00:10:35.171
We don't seem to have
anything in common. The guy's a stiff.


154
00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:38.554
Yes, darling. I know the General
may be a little gruff,


155
00:10:38.643 --> 00:10:41.477
and somewhat overbearing at times,

156
00:10:41.562 --> 00:10:44.555
but I know that he cares about you.

157
00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:47.311
He's just not particularly good
at showing it.


158
00:10:47.902 --> 00:10:52.021
But you should have seen how persistently
he asked for your hand in marriage.


159
00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:53.356
But why me?

160
00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:55.941
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.


161
00:10:56.411 --> 00:10:57.902
It's your place, dear.

162
00:10:59.038 --> 00:11:02.907
- What if I don't like my place?
- Everyone has their place, Bala:


163
00:11:03.293 --> 00:11:06.001
you, the soldiers, the workers.

164
00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:09.163
Now, it's not all that bad
being princess, is it?


165
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.003
Would you prefer to be
carting around dirt all day?


166
00:11:12.093 --> 00:11:14.130
Oh, Mother, don't be so dramatic.

167
00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:19.798
At least, they seem to have some fun
every now and then.


168
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.598
- Two aphid beers.
- Why'd I have to be born a worker?


169
00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:31.939
You soldiers get all the glory,
plus you get to go out in the world.


170
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.317
You meet interesting insects,
you get to kill them.


171
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:35.527
Yeah.

172
00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:38.074
But you get to
spend all day with those...

173
00:11:38.995 --> 00:11:40.782
beautiful worker girls.

174
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:44.824
Weaver, they're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.


175
00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:49.537
I really don't think I'm ever gonna meet
the right girl for me.


176
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.418
Who said a girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.


177
00:11:52.508 --> 00:11:55.216
Don't you want your aphid beer?

178
00:11:55.678 --> 00:11:57.156
Call me crazy, but...

179
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.218
I have a thing about drinking
from the anus of another creature. Okay?


180
00:12:00.308 --> 00:12:01.515
Suit yourself.

181
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.387
Ah! Me, I'm cuttin' loose.

182
00:12:06.689 --> 00:12:08.521
We got royal inspection comin' up.

183
00:12:08.608 --> 00:12:11.396
Inspection, meaning you're gonna
stand around like an idiot


184
00:12:11.486 --> 00:12:13.523
while a bunch of
blue bloods smirk at you.

185
00:12:13.988 --> 00:12:15.674
I don't know how you put up with it,
Weaver.


186
00:12:15.698 --> 00:12:18.566
Z, I've known you
for a long time. Right?

187
00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:21.026
Definitely. You were born
two seconds after me.


188
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.079
Yeah. And ever since we were little,
I've been listenin' to you complain.


189
00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:26.157
What are you bitching about?

190
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.038
In case you haven't noticed,
we ants are running the show.


191
00:12:29.128 --> 00:12:30.619
We're the lords of the Earth.

192
00:12:30.713 --> 00:12:33.376
Hey. Don't talk to me about earth, okay?

193
00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:35.549
'Cause I just spent all day
hauling it around.


194
00:12:37.095 --> 00:12:39.929
There's just gotta be a better place.

195
00:12:40.932 --> 00:12:43.766
There is. I've been there.

196
00:12:44.644 --> 00:12:46.761
I'm sor... I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?


197
00:12:46.854 --> 00:12:48.766
There is a better place.

198
00:12:50.191 --> 00:12:51.727
Insectopia.

199
00:12:51.818 --> 00:12:55.983
Oh, really. Lunatic at 3:00.

200
00:12:56.322 --> 00:13:00.236
You can't understand until you go there
and see it for yourself.


201
00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:03.151
You can be your own ant there.

202
00:13:03.496 --> 00:13:05.738
The streets are paved with food.

203
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.157
Nobody tellin' you what to do.

204
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.244
No wars. No colony.

205
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.499
- I shoulda never left.
- Oh, yeah. Fascinating.


206
00:13:16.592 --> 00:13:20.256
We were on a long-range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.


207
00:13:20.513 --> 00:13:24.006
Nothing like a little post-traumatic
stress disorder to make your day complete.


208
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.934
- Then I saw it! Insectopia!
- Hey!


209
00:13:27.353 --> 00:13:28.935
You head towards the monolith.

210
00:13:29.021 --> 00:13:32.310
Ten clicks past the great canyons
to the land of red and white!


211
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.359
Hey, gramps.
You've had enough for one night.


212
00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:37.565
Come on. Before you get in trouble.

213
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.192
Head for the monolith! Listen to me!

214
00:13:40.283 --> 00:13:41.283
The monolith!

215
00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:44.443
That guy's got a screw loose.

216
00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:47.120
- Cross the lake!
- Insectopia.


217
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.281
Wouldn't it be great
if it were that easy?

218
00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:53.585
- Yeah. Dream on, Z.
- Cross the lake!


219
00:13:53.963 --> 00:13:55.829
Look for the land of red and white!

220
00:13:57.133 --> 00:14:02.128
Wow! This is so... gritty.

221
00:14:02.472 --> 00:14:05.636
Ten minutes and we're out of here.
Right? This place is off-limits.


222
00:14:05.725 --> 00:14:08.388
Just blame it on me.
Say it was all my idea.


223
00:14:08.478 --> 00:14:10.014
It is all your idea.

224
00:14:10.104 --> 00:14:13.393
Besides, no one's gonna recognize us.

225
00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:16.399
Come on, girls. 
What do you say?

226
00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:19.311
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

227
00:14:20.323 --> 00:14:23.441
<i>Okay, everybody.

228
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.323
- Time to cut a rug, Z.
- Oh, no. That's okay.


229
00:14:27.413 --> 00:14:30.497
I'm gonna leave the rug
just the way it is, Weaver.


230
00:14:42.637 --> 00:14:44.048
Step back, ladies.

231
00:14:44.597 --> 00:14:47.556
I'm gonna ask one of these workers
to dance with me.


232
00:14:47.934 --> 00:14:48.934
Oh.

233
00:14:51.145 --> 00:14:53.353
What a bunch of losers.

234
00:14:53.814 --> 00:14:57.103
Mindless zombies capitulating
to an oppressive system.


235
00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:59.105
Hi. Wanna dance?

236
00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:01.278
Absolutely.

237
00:15:02.657 --> 00:15:03.657
Follow me.

238
00:15:05.743 --> 00:15:08.201
So, how come I haven't seen you
around here before?


239
00:15:08.704 --> 00:15:10.286
Oh, I don't get out much.

240
00:15:10.873 --> 00:15:12.956
I, uh, I work over at the palace.

241
00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:16.376
Oh, the palace, huh?
I bet those royals really live it up.


242
00:15:16.754 --> 00:15:19.792
Course they're all a little,
you know, from inbreeding.


243
00:15:19.882 --> 00:15:20.882
What?

244
00:15:24.554 --> 00:15:25.554
Yowch!

245
00:15:27.557 --> 00:15:29.048
Ya-ya-yowch!

246
00:15:30.268 --> 00:15:31.268
Yowch.

247
00:15:35.147 --> 00:15:38.311
- Yowch.
- What on earth are you doing?


248
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:42.395
Well, actually, to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of making it up.


249
00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:44.072
Really?

250
00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:46.239
Why does everybody have to dance
the same way?


251
00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:49.489
You know, that's completely boring.
It's... It's monotonous.


252
00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:51.616
It's no fun.

253
00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:23.728
Hey. Watch your step, worker.

254
00:16:23.821 --> 00:16:26.529
You watch yours, buddy,
or you'll be in big trouble.


255
00:16:26.616 --> 00:16:29.734
Th-Th-That's okay.
I'll... I'm gonna let him off this time.


256
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.033
What? Are you crazy?
This guy's built like a pebble.


257
00:16:33.122 --> 00:16:34.863
Aren't you even gonna defend yourself?

258
00:16:34.957 --> 00:16:36.619
Hey, buddy. Get back in place.

259
00:16:38.252 --> 00:16:41.916
- Me? Uh... Uh...
- What if he doesn't want to?


260
00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:46.007
Yeah.
What if I don't like my place?


261
00:16:46.093 --> 00:16:48.426
- What's he talkin' about?
- We got us a troublemaker.


262
00:16:48.512 --> 00:16:49.548
Buckle up, Spanky.

263
00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:53.349
This one goes out
to all the lazy workers.


264
00:16:55.811 --> 00:16:58.178
You ought to watch that
aggressive behavior, buddy.


265
00:16:58.272 --> 00:17:00.389
He's just a worker.

266
00:17:03.027 --> 00:17:04.787
- Take it outside!
- Come on!


267
00:17:20.294 --> 00:17:23.833
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
The guards are coming.


268
00:17:25.007 --> 00:17:27.920
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait! Wait!


269
00:17:30.596 --> 00:17:32.679
Princess? You're a princess?

270
00:17:32.765 --> 00:17:34.882
Uh, I gotta go.

271
00:17:34.975 --> 00:17:37.888
- When can I see you again?
- Let me think.


272
00:17:39.355 --> 00:17:40.355
Never.

273
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:42.393
- Bye.
- No. Wait!

- Can I get you another one, pal?
- No, thanks.


282
00:18:40.416 --> 00:18:44.205
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.


283
00:18:44.295 --> 00:18:47.879
It's always slow in here the night
before one of those royal reviews.


284
00:18:47.965 --> 00:18:51.003
I guess the soldiers need their shut-eye
before they meet the queen.


285
00:18:51.594 --> 00:18:53.301
- I don't blame ya.
- That's it!


286
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.887
You know, I was once...

287
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640
See ya.

288
00:19:04.648 --> 00:19:06.264
Psst. Weaver.

289
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.523
I figured it out! Weaver. Weaver!

290
00:19:10.613 --> 00:19:11.694
What? What?

291
00:19:11.781 --> 00:19:13.581
I got a great idea.

292
00:19:13.949 --> 00:19:17.943
You gotta switch places with me. Let me go
to the inspection instead of you.


293
00:19:18.204 --> 00:19:21.948
- What time is it?
- Weaver. The royal family will be there.


294
00:19:22.249 --> 00:19:23.956
This is the only
way I can see her.

295
00:19:24.668 --> 00:19:27.251
- See who?
- Princess Bala.


296
00:19:27.588 --> 00:19:28.704
Are you nuts?

297
00:19:29.131 --> 00:19:31.464
You want me to switch places with you?

298
00:19:32.092 --> 00:19:34.379
Do you know how much trouble
you can get into


299
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.883
for even talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier?


300
00:19:37.223 --> 00:19:38.930
You can get in trouble just for listenin'

301
00:19:39.016 --> 00:19:41.554
to someone talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier.


302
00:19:42.311 --> 00:19:44.177
You have to help me.

303
00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:48.185
If I can't see her again,
my life is just not worth living.


304
00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:51.651
Pl
-Pl
-Please, Weaver. Please.

305
00:19:52.154 --> 00:19:55.238
Switch jobs with me just for a day.

306
00:19:55.866 --> 00:19:57.826
Th-Think of all the things
that I've done for you.


307
00:19:58.536 --> 00:20:00.573
Mm-hmm. I can't think of any.

308
00:20:01.247 --> 00:20:04.740
Okay. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.


309
00:20:07.586 --> 00:20:08.918
Would I meet some worker girls?

310
00:20:09.004 --> 00:20:12.463
Are you kidding?
They always go after the new guy.


311
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.212
It's like a sport for them!

312
00:20:14.593 --> 00:20:17.085
And-And believe me,
they will definitely go for


313
00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:19.011
an adorable little insect like you.

314
00:20:19.098 --> 00:20:20.098
Mm-hmm.

315
00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:23.766
Weaver, I... I have to see her again.

316
00:20:24.144 --> 00:20:28.184
Z, what kind of chance
do you have with a princess?


317
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.649
I mean, she probably
won't even remember you.


318
00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:35.687
I... I know it sounds nuts.

319
00:20:37.074 --> 00:20:38.531
But I have to try.

320
00:20:40.327 --> 00:20:41.943
Oh, boy.

321
00:20:43.581 --> 00:20:45.368
Princess, fancy meeting you here.

322
00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:48.291
What do you say we lose this crowd?

323
00:20:50.004 --> 00:20:53.588
Oh, me? You know, I... 
I wear many hats.

324
00:20:53.674 --> 00:20:56.166
I guess you'd have to call me
a Renaissance ant.


325
00:20:56.677 --> 00:20:57.793
Eyes right!

326
00:21:02.516 --> 00:21:05.725
- Beautiful! Just beautiful!
- Mm.


327
00:21:06.812 --> 00:21:09.555
The precision. The order.

328
00:21:10.065 --> 00:21:13.649
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
Hey. It's me.


329
00:21:13.736 --> 00:21:15.477
Remember Z from the bar?

330
00:21:15.571 --> 00:21:18.985
Princess Bala! Princess Bala! Princess...

331
00:21:19.074 --> 00:21:21.282
Bala, you must encourage the troops.

332
00:21:21.952 --> 00:21:22.952
Wave.

333
00:21:23.871 --> 00:21:27.911
Oh. She sees me!
Excuse me, guys. I-I... I'm sorry.


334
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.242
I just got a better offer.
Could you excu...


335
00:21:30.336 --> 00:21:31.872
Company halt!

336
00:21:35.883 --> 00:21:37.044
Princess!

337
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.923
- Princess Bala!
- Quiet there! Get back in rank.


338
00:21:42.014 --> 00:21:46.054
- You new, kid?
- Oh, yes, but I'm gettin' out soon.


339
00:21:46.143 --> 00:21:48.180
I
-I got a trial membership.

340
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.763
Trial membership.
That's a good one!


341
00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:54.475
- Name's Barbatus.
- Z.


342
00:21:54.568 --> 00:21:56.560
- Right face!
- Psst!


343
00:22:04.495 --> 00:22:09.286
Sacrifice. To some, it is just a word.

344
00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:12.200
To others, it is a code!

345
00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:15.002
Jeez. I'm bad at word games.

346
00:22:15.089 --> 00:22:18.207
A soldier knows that the life
of an individual ant doesn't matter.


347
00:22:18.968 --> 00:22:20.504
What matters is the colony.

348
00:22:21.053 --> 00:22:24.637
He's willing to live for the colony,
to fight for the colony,


349
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.222
to die for the colony.

350
00:22:26.308 --> 00:22:29.847
- This guy's crazy.
- I hear ya.


351
00:22:29.937 --> 00:22:34.398
At 0800 hours, we received word
that the termite enemy has mobilized.


352
00:22:34.942 --> 00:22:38.276
We have no choice but to launch
a preemptive strike.


353
00:22:38.904 --> 00:22:40.816
You are the queen's finest.

354
00:22:41.156 --> 00:22:43.239
I know you will all do your duty.

355
00:22:44.326 --> 00:22:46.818
I am proud to send you into battle.

356
00:22:46.912 --> 00:22:49.495
Into... I'm sor... 
I'm sorry, into battle?

357
00:22:49.581 --> 00:22:53.416
- Dismissed.
- Left face. Forward march.


358
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.912
You know, I think there's been
a terrible mistake.


359
00:22:57.006 --> 00:22:59.999
You know, the truth is I just...
I just came for the speech.


360
00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:02.675
Don't worry, kid. 
I'll watch out for ya.

361
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:10.810
Sound off!

362
00:23:10.853 --> 00:23:11.889
- One!
- Two!


363
00:23:11.979 --> 00:23:13.095
Sound off!

364
00:23:13.188 --> 00:23:14.269
- Three!
- Huh?


365
00:23:14.356 --> 00:23:15.267
Sound off!

366
00:23:15.357 --> 00:23:16.438
- Five!
- Six!


367
00:23:16.525 --> 00:23:17.561
- Seven!
- Eight!


368
00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:18.651
- Nine!
- Ten!


369
00:23:18.736 --> 00:23:19.897
- Eleven!
- Twelve!


370
00:23:19.987 --> 00:23:21.068
- Thirteen!
- Fourteen!


371
00:23:22.197 --> 00:23:26.567
<i>♪ We ants go marching one by one
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>


372
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.449
<i>♪ We slaughter termites just for fun
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>


373
00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:32.701
So, these termites, they're-they're...

374
00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:36.455
These guys are not going to put up much of
a fight? We're talkin' pushovers, right?


375
00:23:36.545 --> 00:23:39.458
Not really, kid.
They're five times our size.


376
00:23:39.548 --> 00:23:41.628
And they shoot acid from their foreheads.

377
00:23:42.342 --> 00:23:44.379
Hey! Keep it movin', shorty!

378
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.339
<i>♪ We ants go marching two by two

Hurrah, hurrah ♪</i>


380
00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:56.309
Say, what exactly does our platoon do?

381
00:23:56.398 --> 00:24:00.642
I mean, will we be serving beverages
or processing paperwork?


382
00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:04.320
Our platoon has the best assignment
of all! We're the first into battle.


383
00:24:04.406 --> 00:24:08.366
<i>♪ We ants go marching three by three

386
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.163
Hey. Wait a minute. Let's not get...
We're being too hasty here.


387
00:24:18.253 --> 00:24:21.371
These... These guys sound like bruisers.

388
00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:23.377
Just how were you figuring
on beating them?


389
00:24:23.467 --> 00:24:25.379
Superior numbers, kid!

390
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:28.344
Overwhelm their defenses
and kill their queen!


391
00:24:29.598 --> 00:24:32.341
Hey, fellas. You're being
a little extreme, I feel.


392
00:24:32.434 --> 00:24:35.347
Why don't we try and influence
their political process


393
00:24:35.437 --> 00:24:37.178
with campaign contributions?

394
00:24:37.272 --> 00:24:40.856
I like you, kid!
You got a sense of humor.


395
00:24:40.943 --> 00:24:44.857
- Forward!
- Come on. Let's kick some termite butt!


396
00:24:44.947 --> 00:24:46.939
Over the top!

397
00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:53.612
Yeeow!

398
00:24:59.378 --> 00:25:00.869
Yee-haw!

399
00:25:18.814 --> 00:25:20.931
- Where is everyone?
- Something's not right.


400
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.521
Don't be scared, kid.

401
00:25:30.242 --> 00:25:31.449
They're here!

402
00:25:33.162 --> 00:25:36.701
Attack!

403
00:26:00.022 --> 00:26:01.022
Come on.

404
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:19.869
Barbatus, you saved my life.

405
00:26:19.958 --> 00:26:21.870
Ah, don't get all sappy about it.

406
00:26:29.885 --> 00:26:32.502
Hey, guys. Look out behind you!

407
00:26:41.063 --> 00:26:42.520
Hey. Hey, guys?

408
00:26:42.814 --> 00:26:45.397
Can somebody help me here?
Can anybody... Hey.


409
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:00.581
Yeah.

410
00:27:03.794 --> 00:27:05.251
Okay, mama.

411
00:27:06.046 --> 00:27:07.046
Yeah!

412
00:27:08.924 --> 00:27:11.541
Oh, yeah. Big guy comin' through.

413
00:27:14.513 --> 00:27:15.594
Love it.

414
00:27:21.436 --> 00:27:24.304
Hey. Hey. Hey. 
Take it easy, muscles.

415
00:27:25.607 --> 00:27:27.599
You're makin' the rest of us look bad.

416
00:27:29.278 --> 00:27:30.610
What happened to Z?

417
00:27:31.613 --> 00:27:34.777
He's takin' a personal day,
so I'm fillin' in.


418
00:27:35.284 --> 00:27:37.697
You fill in any more, and you'll explode.

419
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.491
Eh, you got a problem?

420
00:27:44.584 --> 00:27:47.452
No, um...

421
00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:49.106
Nobody told me digging was so much fun.

422
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:52.420
You know, you pick the dirt up.
You move it.


423
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:56.844
You pick it up again.
You move it again. Lots of reps.


424
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.172
You exercise the arms and the thorax.

425
00:27:59.266 --> 00:28:01.474
Yes, I... I see what you mean.

426
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.303
- Mm. Yeah. That is fascinating.
- Sorry, sir.


427
00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:06.812
I was just havin' a little chat
with my friend, sir.


428
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.649
You know, I just had a little chat
with General Mandible.


429
00:28:11.486 --> 00:28:15.230
Anybody who doesn't meet his quota
is going to be downsized.


430
00:28:15.324 --> 00:28:16.690
Come on. Cut him a break.

431
00:28:18.327 --> 00:28:19.327
He's new.

432
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:20.870
Hey.

433
00:28:21.288 --> 00:28:24.577
What do you say we help
your attitude a little bit


434
00:28:24.666 --> 00:28:28.285
by taking away your rations
for the day?


435
00:28:29.588 --> 00:28:30.588
Thanks for your time.

436
00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:34.503
I don't know what came over me.

437
00:28:34.593 --> 00:28:35.879
Talking back like that.

438
00:28:37.179 --> 00:28:38.179
I must be losin' it.

439
00:28:39.264 --> 00:28:40.675
Sorry I got you in trouble.

440
00:28:40.766 --> 00:28:44.430
But, listen, you can...
share my rations. Whoa.


441
00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:45.519
If you want.

442
00:28:46.313 --> 00:28:49.647
Are you askin' me out to dinner?

443
00:28:49.733 --> 00:28:53.226
Oh, no. I... Well...

444
00:28:53.862 --> 00:28:56.605
If you don't have anything else planned.

445
00:28:56.698 --> 00:28:59.031
I'll check my calendar.

446
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:00.910
You know...

447
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.283
I'm kinda glad Z's takin' a breather.

448
00:29:36.696 --> 00:29:37.696
Kid!

449
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.856
Kid, over here.

450
00:29:42.244 --> 00:29:43.576
Barbatus.

451
00:29:44.246 --> 00:29:47.739
Be honest, kid. 
Am I hurt bad?

452
00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:52.456
N-No. N-Not at all. You're...
Actually, you're lookin' terrific.


453
00:29:52.546 --> 00:29:55.880
You got, you know,
swell color in your cheeks.


454
00:29:56.216 --> 00:29:59.584
No. I can see it in your eyes.

455
00:30:00.804 --> 00:30:01.920
I'm a goner.

456
00:30:03.723 --> 00:30:04.723
Help me up, Z.

457
00:30:07.602 --> 00:30:11.095
Oh! I can't feel my legs.

458
00:30:11.189 --> 00:30:15.900
You gotta hang in there, buddy.
I know you're gonna make it.


459
00:30:15.986 --> 00:30:18.820
Just take... take deep breaths.

460
00:30:18.905 --> 00:30:21.773
Because I'm gonna try and find your body.

461
00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:25.827
It's bound to be out there somewhere...

462
00:30:33.462 --> 00:30:35.954
Barbatus, hang on.

463
00:30:38.133 --> 00:30:41.877
- Barbatus...
- Don't make my mistake, kid.


464
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.296
Don't follow orders your whole life.

465
00:30:46.766 --> 00:30:48.553
Think for yourself.

466
00:30:53.899 --> 00:30:55.481
Barbatus.

467
00:31:10.373 --> 00:31:11.453
<i>We're on schedule.</i>

468
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.334
Work is completed on "A" section, sir.

469
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:16.501
We're clearing a path
through "D" section now.


470
00:31:16.588 --> 00:31:19.922
We need to push harder, Cutter.
I want double shifts around-the-clock.


471
00:31:20.008 --> 00:31:22.921
- We can't afford to let up. Is that clear?
- Crystal, sir.


472
00:31:23.011 --> 00:31:25.344
Good. What about section...

473
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.637
Excuse me, sir.

474
00:31:27.182 --> 00:31:28.593
This had better be important.

475
00:31:28.683 --> 00:31:30.515
Well, it's about the termite battle, sir.

476
00:31:30.936 --> 00:31:35.852
The enemy was destroyed, but I'm afraid
it was a disaster for our troops, as well.


477
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:39.104
Well, that's terrible. Terrible!

478
00:31:39.528 --> 00:31:42.942
There is a bit of good news, sir.
One soldier did make it back.


479
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:44.772
- No kidding?
- What did you say?


480
00:31:44.866 --> 00:31:46.607
Word is spreading through the colony, sir.

481
00:31:46.701 --> 00:31:49.114
The queen requested a meeting
with the war hero.


482
00:31:49.454 --> 00:31:52.697
Damn! Good.
Damn good.


483
00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:54.032
Uh, I'll handle this.

484
00:31:58.338 --> 00:32:00.455
Congratulations, soldier.

485
00:32:02.175 --> 00:32:05.043
Well, you're a little short
for a war hero, aren't you?


486
00:32:05.345 --> 00:32:06.586
A war hero?

487
00:32:07.013 --> 00:32:11.303
Sir. I don't actually think
that I'm a hero.


488
00:32:11.393 --> 00:32:13.259
Good. I don't like heroes.

489
00:32:13.353 --> 00:32:15.553
But, sir. You don't understand.

490
00:32:23.738 --> 00:32:25.650
I... I didn't do anything.

491
00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.780
I mean, it was all horrible.
It was just a massacre.


492
00:32:29.869 --> 00:32:32.156
A massacre upon a massacre.

493
00:32:32.247 --> 00:32:34.739
That's good, soldier. Now, wave.

494
00:32:42.007 --> 00:32:44.215
There was nothing you could do, Weaver.

495
00:32:44.843 --> 00:32:46.755
You didn't know they were going to war.

496
00:32:47.137 --> 00:32:49.003
I just feel horrible.

497
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:53.141
Poor Z. I should
have never let him go.

498
00:32:53.768 --> 00:32:56.351
Wait a minute. 
That's no soldier.

499
00:32:56.438 --> 00:32:57.770
That's Z!

500
00:32:58.148 --> 00:32:59.148
Z?

501
00:32:59.566 --> 00:33:02.274
The little guy made it!

502
00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:07.480
Let's go, soldier.

503
00:33:17.167 --> 00:33:20.751
As I was saying, son,
you are an ant after my own heart.


504
00:33:21.004 --> 00:33:24.088
An ant that looks Death
in the face and laughs.


505
00:33:25.091 --> 00:33:27.048
Well, actually, the truth is,

506
00:33:27.135 --> 00:33:29.548
I generally just make
belittling comments


507
00:33:29.638 --> 00:33:31.595
and snicker behind Death's back.

508
00:33:33.475 --> 00:33:34.636
General Mandible!

509
00:33:37.437 --> 00:33:39.394
Keep your comments to yourself.

510
00:33:39.731 --> 00:33:40.938
Let me do the talking.

511
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.983
May I present Her Majesty, the Queen.

512
00:33:52.786 --> 00:33:54.368
Charmed. Charmed.

513
00:33:54.454 --> 00:33:56.411
And the Royal Princess Bala.

514
00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:00.199
Welcome home, soldier.

515
00:34:00.919 --> 00:34:04.583
We cannot begin to express our gratitude
for your heroic efforts.


516
00:34:04.673 --> 00:34:07.666
The private has asked me to convey
his most humble appreciation.


517
00:34:07.759 --> 00:34:10.843
Please. Please. 
It was nothing really.

518
00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.592
Just your average run-of-the-mill valor

519
00:34:13.682 --> 00:34:16.265
and extraordinary courageousness,
you know.


520
00:34:16.351 --> 00:34:19.594
In the heat of battle,
there's very little time to think.


521
00:34:19.688 --> 00:34:23.102
One must attack! Attack! Attack!

522
00:34:23.191 --> 00:34:25.604
Well, indeed.

523
00:34:25.694 --> 00:34:29.278
As you can see, Your Highness,
the battlefield is fresh in his mind.


524
00:34:29.364 --> 00:34:31.230
So, begging your pardon,

525
00:34:31.324 --> 00:34:34.283
but this is the perfect time
to debrief the private.


526
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:37.783
Oh, please, General.
Not on our first date.


527
00:34:38.164 --> 00:34:40.201
Not on our first date.

528
00:34:40.542 --> 00:34:42.625
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

529
00:34:42.711 --> 00:34:45.954
Well, maybe. And then again, maybe not.

530
00:34:46.047 --> 00:34:47.879
And then... then again.

531
00:34:48.883 --> 00:34:49.714
Yowch.

532
00:34:49.801 --> 00:34:52.418
That's it! You're the guy from the bar.

533
00:34:52.512 --> 00:34:55.300
- Don't! Shh!
- "Bar"? What bar?


534
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.633
I danced with this guy
at the bar the other night.


535
00:34:59.227 --> 00:35:00.809
He was just a worker then.

536
00:35:01.438 --> 00:35:04.351
- What were you doing at a bar?
- Precisely what I want to know.


537
00:35:04.691 --> 00:35:06.478
No. This isn't about me.

538
00:35:06.568 --> 00:35:09.231
I mean, look at this worker.
Look what he's done.


539
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.734
I think you're thinkin' of someone else.
After all, I am a solider.


540
00:35:13.074 --> 00:35:15.782
Exactly. You were a worker.

541
00:35:16.244 --> 00:35:17.985
But now, you're a war hero.

542
00:35:19.289 --> 00:35:23.158
- He's a worker?
- A worker danced with my fiancée?


543
00:35:23.418 --> 00:35:26.877
F
-Fiancée? W
-W
-Wait a minute.

544
00:35:26.963 --> 00:35:29.706
This is not how it looks.
I can explain this.


545
00:35:29.799 --> 00:35:32.416
Hey. She was the one
making all the moves.


546
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.510
Arrest him.

547
00:35:33.762 --> 00:35:36.846
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.
Take it easy. Can't we discuss this?


548
00:35:36.931 --> 00:35:39.548
What are you doing? 
Let go of my daughter.

549
00:35:39.851 --> 00:35:41.808
He's taking her hostage!

550
00:35:41.895 --> 00:35:45.514
No. No. I'm not.
I mean, yes, I am.

551
00:35:46.316 --> 00:35:48.273
One more step and, uh,
the princess gets it.


552
00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:51.067
Let go of me!

553
00:35:51.154 --> 00:35:52.154
Ow!

554
00:35:52.655 --> 00:35:54.612
Don't make me hurt her. Ow!

555
00:36:10.924 --> 00:36:11.789
Uh.

556
00:36:11.883 --> 00:36:14.500
What are you doing, you creep?

557
00:36:14.928 --> 00:36:17.011
Are you out of your puny little mind?

558
00:36:17.096 --> 00:36:20.214
There they are! Down there!
Let's go. Move. Move. Move.


559
00:36:20.308 --> 00:36:21.970
Oh, good.

560
00:36:22.769 --> 00:36:26.012
Here they come to
rescue me and kill you.

561
00:36:26.105 --> 00:36:26.891
Kill?

562
00:36:26.981 --> 00:36:29.064
- Hey, you guys!
- Stop it. Stop it.


563
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.608
- What are you tryin' to do?
- Get off me, you little twerp!


564
00:36:31.694 --> 00:36:32.797
- What do you want to do?
- Ow!


565
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:34.421
- Throw away everything we've got?
- Hey!


566
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.402
What're you waiting for?

567
00:36:37.492 --> 00:36:39.859
Hello? Guys!

568
00:36:46.835 --> 00:36:48.622
- Huh?
- What is it?


569
00:36:53.758 --> 00:36:55.340
It's beautiful.

570
00:36:55.552 --> 00:36:57.509
Ridgeway, get out of there!

571
00:37:23.788 --> 00:37:24.824
- Oof!
- Uh!


572
00:37:38.803 --> 00:37:41.967
- Oh. Don't worry. I'm okay.
- You?


573
00:37:42.056 --> 00:37:44.548
You? You're okay?

574
00:37:45.101 --> 00:37:46.592
Hey. Who cares about you?

575
00:37:46.686 --> 00:37:48.894
- I almost died here.
- Will you please calm down?


576
00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.563
You're not going to let
a little near-death experience


577
00:37:51.649 --> 00:37:52.810
ruin your mood, are you?

578
00:37:52.901 --> 00:37:57.066
Hey. This is not a mood, okay?
You're not listening to me.


579
00:37:58.865 --> 00:38:00.072
Where am I?

580
00:38:03.912 --> 00:38:04.948
Look, what's-your-name.

581
00:38:05.038 --> 00:38:08.998
Just climb up that tree
and find out where I am.


582
00:38:09.083 --> 00:38:11.746
Look, the-the trick is not to panic.

583
00:38:11.836 --> 00:38:14.579
You know, h-h-he who panics is lost.

584
00:38:15.048 --> 00:38:17.415
What am I saying? We are lost.

585
00:38:24.891 --> 00:38:26.883
Ow!

586
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.512
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.

587
00:38:32.148 --> 00:38:33.355
Who's the bigger idiot,

588
00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:36.149
the idiot or the idiot
who gets kidnapped by the idiot?


589
00:38:36.235 --> 00:38:38.522
What'd you do,
talk those termites to death?


590
00:38:38.863 --> 00:38:42.277
I can't believe you tried to
pass yourself off as a soldier.


591
00:38:43.368 --> 00:38:44.700
Why are you stalking me?

592
00:38:45.286 --> 00:38:48.529
Don't you realize I'm out of your league?

593
00:38:48.623 --> 00:38:50.489
You're the one
who was cruising the worker bar


594
00:38:50.583 --> 00:38:51.744
looking for a little action.

595
00:38:51.834 --> 00:38:54.201
And you just happened to find it...

596
00:38:54.462 --> 00:38:58.206
the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker.

597
00:38:59.092 --> 00:39:01.800
Please. I was slumming it.

598
00:39:02.095 --> 00:39:03.211
Don't you get it?

599
00:39:03.638 --> 00:39:07.803
I chose you because you were
the most pathetic little bug in the joint.


600
00:39:08.017 --> 00:39:12.057
I was gonna let you become part
of my most erotic fantasies,


601
00:39:12.146 --> 00:39:14.559
but now you can just forget that.

602
00:39:14.649 --> 00:39:18.563
Write it off, you know. I guess
what you prefer is old Blood and Guts.


603
00:39:18.653 --> 00:39:22.897
This guy's idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at a public execution.


604
00:39:23.491 --> 00:39:26.325
Boy. You really chose the right husband.

605
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:28.323
For your information,

606
00:39:28.413 --> 00:39:31.121
the General and I are deeply,

607
00:39:31.207 --> 00:39:35.042
deeply in... engaged.

608
00:39:35.128 --> 00:39:38.246
You come right back down here
this instant!


609
00:39:38.506 --> 00:39:42.045
We are marching straight back
to the colony so that I...


610
00:39:47.515 --> 00:39:49.347
The monolith!

611
00:39:49.434 --> 00:39:50.845
...stupid little bug you are!

612
00:39:50.935 --> 00:39:53.427
Absolutely. Wonderful.
That's an appealing offer.


613
00:39:53.521 --> 00:39:58.641
But, considering the options, you go back.
Okay? 'Cause I'm going on to Insectopia.


614
00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:02.520
Oh. Come on. "Insectopia"?

615
00:40:03.031 --> 00:40:04.488
You're crazier than I thought.

616
00:40:04.824 --> 00:40:09.034
Yeah? Well, I happen to have
it on a very reliable source.


617
00:40:10.038 --> 00:40:13.827
Or... Or should I say,
a drunk, raving source?


618
00:40:13.916 --> 00:40:18.001
But the point is,
I'm convinced the place definitely exists.


619
00:40:18.463 --> 00:40:22.207
Stop! I order you to stop, worker!

620
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.714
Hey. I got a name. Okay? It's Z.

621
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.383
And out here, you can't order me around.

622
00:40:29.057 --> 00:40:31.720
All right. Fine. No problem.

623
00:40:46.908 --> 00:40:50.652
Worker! Worker!
Where are you?


624
00:40:51.162 --> 00:40:55.202
Z? Z? Wait for me.

625
00:40:56.751 --> 00:40:59.915
No more excuses, General.
I want my daughter back.


626
00:41:01.047 --> 00:41:03.755
Frankly, I'm beginning to doubt
your ability to handle this.


627
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.509
Believe me, Your Highness,
we will spare no effort to bring her back.


628
00:41:07.887 --> 00:41:12.222
Princess Bala is essential
to all our plans for the future.


629
00:41:14.435 --> 00:41:17.849
So he kills himself a hundred termites,
gets a few medals,


630
00:41:17.939 --> 00:41:21.228
then bada-bing, bada-bip,
bags himself the princess.


631
00:41:21.317 --> 00:41:23.730
He looks him dead in the eye
and says, "Bite me."


632
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.982
He said that to General Mandible?

633
00:41:26.072 --> 00:41:28.689
Buddy. Hey, hey, buddy.

634
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.363
You heard about the war hero named Z?

635
00:41:31.911 --> 00:41:33.493
Runs off with the princess, right?

636
00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:38.244
When they sent the guards after him,
he just looks at 'em and boom!


637
00:41:38.584 --> 00:41:42.544
- They burst into flames.
- Z? You talkin' about Z?


638
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.587
Hey, I know the guy.
He's a friend of mine.


639
00:41:44.674 --> 00:41:46.040
I think your information...

640
00:41:46.134 --> 00:41:50.299
- You know Z?
- Yeah. He's a worker. He used to dig here.


641
00:41:50.388 --> 00:41:54.803
A worker? That's impossible.
A worker can't do anything, except work.


642
00:41:54.892 --> 00:41:57.009
Yeah. It's not like we got a choice.

643
00:41:57.103 --> 00:42:00.562
We do have a choice.
Uh, I mean, look at Z.


644
00:42:00.648 --> 00:42:02.890
He decided he wanted something,
and he went for it.


645
00:42:02.984 --> 00:42:04.065
He's not alone.

646
00:42:04.152 --> 00:42:07.236
I used to be a soldier,
and I switched places with him.


647
00:42:07.321 --> 00:42:10.735
Wait a second. You're tellin' me
I don't have to be here?


648
00:42:10.825 --> 00:42:11.986
We've got a choice?

649
00:42:13.703 --> 00:42:15.583
The authorities don't want you
to know about it,


650
00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:17.474
but we don't have to work
on the tunnel anymore.


651
00:42:17.498 --> 00:42:19.660
It's the workers who control
the means of production.


652
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.912
If Z don't dig, I don't dig.

653
00:42:22.003 --> 00:42:24.120
People, what is this?
An encounter group?


654
00:42:25.006 --> 00:42:27.373
- Let's get back to work.
- Why?


655
00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:31.756
...on the tunnel anymore!
This guy, Z, he's leadin' the revolution!


656
00:42:32.388 --> 00:42:34.308
I'll... get back to you.

657
00:42:43.232 --> 00:42:45.940
Think about it, Z. Two ants.

658
00:42:46.777 --> 00:42:51.522
Who ever heard of two ants?
Two million ants, maybe. But two?


659
00:42:53.242 --> 00:42:57.361
Look, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty,

660
00:42:57.747 --> 00:43:00.490
and this whole desert thing?

661
00:43:01.584 --> 00:43:02.995
It just doesn't work for me.

662
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:06.579
- Yada, yada, yada, yada.
- I think it's about time you take me back.


663
00:43:06.672 --> 00:43:08.709
Take yourself back. Sheesh.

664
00:43:09.425 --> 00:43:13.044
Excuse me. You kidnapped me, remember?

665
00:43:14.055 --> 00:43:16.593
That means you have
certain responsibilities.


666
00:43:16.682 --> 00:43:19.641
You can't just abandon me
here in the wilderness.


667
00:43:19.727 --> 00:43:22.014
Yeah, well, it's better than
being back at the colony.


668
00:43:22.355 --> 00:43:25.564
- You're not serious, are you?
- Maybe you were living the high life,


669
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.516
but personally, this beats digging.

670
00:43:28.027 --> 00:43:30.788
If you'd ever done a day's labor,
you'd know what I was talking about.


671
00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:35.824
"Labor"? What do you know about labor?

672
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.493
How would you feel
if you were expected to give birth


673
00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:41.071
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life?


674
00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:42.749
Gee.

675
00:43:43.501 --> 00:43:44.537
Water!

676
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.628
Ahh. All you think about is yourself.

677
00:43:52.093 --> 00:43:54.506
Yeah? Well, nobody else
ever thought about me.


678
00:43:54.595 --> 00:43:57.303
So as far as I'm concerned,
I don't need anybody else.


679
00:43:57.723 --> 00:44:02.058
Help! Help me, Bala!

680
00:44:05.439 --> 00:44:08.682
Help! B
-B
-B
-B
-Bala!

681
00:44:08.776 --> 00:44:10.688
Hold on. I'll get you out. Hold on.

682
00:44:11.946 --> 00:44:13.938
Help, Ba...

683
00:44:34.927 --> 00:44:37.214
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.


684
00:44:38.306 --> 00:44:41.470
Now, maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us


685
00:44:42.143 --> 00:44:43.805
and head back to the colo...

686
00:44:44.854 --> 00:44:47.813
Oh, Z! What are you doing?

687
00:44:48.316 --> 00:44:51.809
- We've gotta cross the lake.
- Am I missing something here?


688
00:44:52.194 --> 00:44:54.106
Didn't we just get out of the water?

689
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.948
Bala, look, what have you got to lose?

690
00:44:59.035 --> 00:45:00.617
I mean, think about it.

691
00:45:00.703 --> 00:45:04.617
Do you really want to be
Mrs. Raving Lunatic?


692
00:45:08.002 --> 00:45:09.493
There's a better place.

693
00:45:11.005 --> 00:45:12.667
Z, please.

694
00:45:13.341 --> 00:45:16.129
Just... gimme one chance.

695
00:45:16.218 --> 00:45:18.335
If we don't find Insectopia soon,

696
00:45:18.429 --> 00:45:21.342
I promise I'll take you back
to the colony.


697
00:45:36.864 --> 00:45:38.776
I hope you know what you're doing.

698
00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:40.448
Yeah, me, too.

699
00:45:49.377 --> 00:45:52.620
We want Z! We want Z!

700
00:45:52.713 --> 00:45:54.420
People, come on.

701
00:45:55.383 --> 00:45:57.500
I know some ants
who aren't gonna make their quota.


702
00:45:57.802 --> 00:46:00.135
Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor.

703
00:46:00.221 --> 00:46:05.808
We want Z! We want Z!

704
00:46:06.477 --> 00:46:10.471
Sorry, sir. I came as soon as I heard.
I was debriefing the trackers.


705
00:46:10.564 --> 00:46:14.057
- And? What's the report?
- Well, this Z, sir.


706
00:46:14.402 --> 00:46:16.143
He's one slippery character.

707
00:46:16.237 --> 00:46:19.571
They lost Bala's trail
at the edge of the lake.


708
00:46:19.657 --> 00:46:20.738
The lake?

709
00:46:20.825 --> 00:46:24.614
<i>♪ All we are saying ♪</i>

710
00:46:24.703 --> 00:46:28.242
<i>♪ Is give Z a chance ♪</i>

711
00:46:28.749 --> 00:46:30.411
What's that soldier doing there?

712
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:34.836
It appears he's holding hands, sir,
with a worker.


713
00:46:36.132 --> 00:46:37.932
I don't like the way
things are going, Cutter.


714
00:46:38.592 --> 00:46:40.458
I'm counting on you for results.

715
00:46:41.554 --> 00:46:43.841
- Now, can I depend on you or not?
- Yes, sir.


716
00:46:44.098 --> 00:46:45.930
All right, then. 
Let's wrap this up.

717
00:46:47.184 --> 00:46:52.054
We want Z! We want Z!

718
00:46:52.148 --> 00:46:54.515
I've heard a lot about this Z.

719
00:46:56.527 --> 00:47:00.646
I even had the pleasure
of meeting him once.


720
00:47:02.074 --> 00:47:03.690
But where is he now?

721
00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.117
Can anyone point him out?

722
00:47:08.372 --> 00:47:11.115
I mean, if this Z
cares so much about us,

723
00:47:12.126 --> 00:47:13.867
then why isn't he here?

724
00:47:15.629 --> 00:47:16.961
I'll tell you why.

725
00:47:17.423 --> 00:47:20.541
Because Z doesn't give a damn about us.

726
00:47:22.803 --> 00:47:26.638
That's why he kidnapped our princess.
That's why he ran away.


727
00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:31.844
Z is no hero. We are the heroes.

728
00:47:32.563 --> 00:47:36.147
We are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony.


729
00:47:36.984 --> 00:47:40.477
And when we've completed
this magnificent structure,


730
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:42.817
we will reap the benefits:

731
00:47:43.324 --> 00:47:46.237
more food and less work for everyone.

732
00:47:47.703 --> 00:47:50.446
And as further reward
for your heroic efforts,


733
00:47:50.998 --> 00:47:53.536
and every one of you
will get the day off!

734
00:47:55.127 --> 00:48:00.714
So you can be the guests of honor
at the MegaTunnel dedication ceremonies!


735
00:48:06.847 --> 00:48:09.214
Mandible! Mandible!

736
00:48:09.308 --> 00:48:12.972
Mandible! Mandible!

737
00:48:13.062 --> 00:48:15.805
Mandible! Mandible!

738
00:48:15.898 --> 00:48:17.935
Mandible! Mandible!

739
00:48:18.025 --> 00:48:19.607
Now bring me that soldier.

740
00:49:00.067 --> 00:49:04.562
Oh, my God! Z! Come here!

741
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.082
It's Insectopia!

742
00:49:25.259 --> 00:49:27.922
You were right. 
It really is here.

743
00:49:40.816 --> 00:49:43.854
- Huh?
- All right. All right!


744
00:49:43.944 --> 00:49:45.651
- You're a genius.
- Let's eat.


745
00:49:50.743 --> 00:49:52.279
Huh.

746
00:49:58.751 --> 00:50:00.959
Well? What's the problem?

747
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.709
There's some kind of force field.

748
00:50:07.134 --> 00:50:11.720
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
How do you get in?


749
00:50:14.725 --> 00:50:17.968
Yes, well, I'm afraid
this is a private function.


750
00:50:18.312 --> 00:50:22.727
- Who are your friends, dear?
- Crawling insects, poopsie.


751
00:50:22.816 --> 00:50:25.604
Oh! The poor dears.

752
00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:29.897
Uh, good morning.

753
00:50:30.324 --> 00:50:32.236
- Huh?
- Darling, really?


754
00:50:32.326 --> 00:50:35.990
Greeting every insect
that emerges out of the grass?


755
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.370
Pardon me. I guess you don't recognize me.

756
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:47.290
I've been traveling and I'm all schlumpy.

757
00:50:47.925 --> 00:50:49.507
I'm Princess Bala.

758
00:50:49.885 --> 00:50:54.505
Oh! It's even worse. 
They're Eurotrash.

759
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.429
Darling, they're poor.
They're dirty. They're smelly.


760
00:50:59.228 --> 00:51:00.810
We have to help them.

761
00:51:01.605 --> 00:51:05.269
Just wait right here.
We'll fetch you a little something.


762
00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:08.852
Oh, please, Muffy. 
Not another crusade.

763
00:51:09.363 --> 00:51:13.232
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.


764
00:51:14.493 --> 00:51:18.362
I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!


765
00:51:18.622 --> 00:51:21.615
Mm. You have such a big heart.

766
00:51:22.167 --> 00:51:24.910
That's why you're
my little cuddly-widdles.


767
00:51:25.003 --> 00:51:29.873
Oh, my big, strong pheromone factory.

768
00:51:31.051 --> 00:51:33.168
- Mm!
- Oh!


769
00:51:33.554 --> 00:51:36.888
Oh, brother.
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.


770
00:51:37.516 --> 00:51:38.973
- You know...
- Oh!


771
00:51:39.059 --> 00:51:41.142
I guess I had imagined Insectopia...

772
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.437
I don't know, a little differently.

773
00:51:50.904 --> 00:51:52.145
Oh, Muffy!

774
00:51:52.239 --> 00:51:55.698
- No! Oh, no!
- Oh, no.


775
00:51:57.035 --> 00:51:58.867
Look out!

776
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:04.786
Z, help me!

777
00:52:06.211 --> 00:52:07.211
Z!

778
00:52:07.546 --> 00:52:10.038
Don't let me... 
Don't let me go, Z.

779
00:52:15.387 --> 00:52:17.253
Get me out of here!

780
00:52:22.144 --> 00:52:23.144
Bala!

781
00:52:30.903 --> 00:52:32.519
Whoa, this is not good.

782
00:52:39.369 --> 00:52:40.860
Whoa!

783
00:52:43.123 --> 00:52:45.115
Whoa-oa-oa!

784
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:18.902
Whoa-oa-oa!

785
00:53:27.501 --> 00:53:28.501
Hi.

786
00:53:35.759 --> 00:53:37.716
- Z?
- Yes?


787
00:53:38.053 --> 00:53:43.014
It looks like this is it, just when...
I was starting to like you.


788
00:53:52.985 --> 00:53:55.272
Who the hell is that?

789
00:54:08.876 --> 00:54:09.876
That's enough.

790
00:54:11.378 --> 00:54:13.711
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

791
00:54:14.298 --> 00:54:19.168
Soldier, the princess is vital
to the future of this colony.


792
00:54:19.928 --> 00:54:22.796
She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.


793
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:24.973
We already have a queen.

794
00:54:25.434 --> 00:54:28.427
As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?


795
00:54:29.187 --> 00:54:31.179
He's not important.

796
00:54:32.858 --> 00:54:33.894
Now, soldier,

797
00:54:34.568 --> 00:54:37.732
we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.


798
00:54:39.072 --> 00:54:40.072
Not you...

799
00:54:41.241 --> 00:54:42.573
not Cutter...

800
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:45.568
Not even her.

801
00:54:46.038 --> 00:54:48.246
Azteca!

802
00:54:48.332 --> 00:54:50.745
Don't tell that tight-ass anything,
Weaver! Ahh!


803
00:54:50.834 --> 00:54:53.076
Where is Z?

804
00:54:53.337 --> 00:54:54.919
I don't know where he is!

805
00:54:55.255 --> 00:54:57.668
Hm. That's too bad.

806
00:55:05.766 --> 00:55:06.766
Wait!

807
00:55:07.809 --> 00:55:08.925
Insectopia!

808
00:55:09.311 --> 00:55:12.804
Uh! I know it sounds crazy,
but that's where he'd be going.


809
00:55:12.898 --> 00:55:18.189
Soldier, you think this is a game?
Insectopia does not exist.


810
00:55:18.278 --> 00:55:21.692
As a matter of fact... it does.

811
00:55:22.199 --> 00:55:22.985
Sir?

812
00:55:23.075 --> 00:55:24.611
I'll brief you on the coordinates.

813
00:55:25.243 --> 00:55:26.859
You're gonna bring the princess back.

814
00:55:27.913 --> 00:55:30.280
And as for Z... kill him.

815
00:55:31.416 --> 00:55:34.329
But you said he didn't matter.

816
00:55:34.419 --> 00:55:38.083
It's for the good of the colony.
You made the right decision.


817
00:55:40.384 --> 00:55:45.721
Gentlemen, now you can see
how dangerous individualism can be.


818
00:55:46.306 --> 00:55:49.390
It makes us... vulnerable.

819
00:55:51.186 --> 00:55:52.186
Let's go.

820
00:55:54.815 --> 00:55:58.604
Take him back to the MegaTunnel.
Put him on the front line.


821
00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.320
Dismissed.

822
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.791
Jeez, what was I thinking?
I almost got you killed.


823
00:56:15.168 --> 00:56:18.832
Z, you know, you really
shouldn't be so hard on...


824
00:56:18.922 --> 00:56:22.916
That's it.
I'm taking you back to the colony.


825
00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:25.047
- Uh! Ow! Oh.
- Uh!


826
00:56:26.263 --> 00:56:30.348
- Insectopia? I must've been crazy.
- Z?


827
00:56:30.684 --> 00:56:32.767
But you know what?
I can admit it when I'm wrong.


828
00:56:32.853 --> 00:56:34.435
- Z.
- And this time, I gotta tell ya,


829
00:56:34.521 --> 00:56:37.355
I was absolutely, 100%...

830
00:56:39.067 --> 00:56:40.183
correct!

831
00:56:41.445 --> 00:56:46.986
Have... Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful in your life?


832
00:56:47.367 --> 00:56:51.782
- It's... Insect...
- Shh! Don't jinx it. Come on!

All right, everybody.
I want all teams in place,


847
00:58:19.501 --> 00:58:23.211
fully prepared, ready to seal the doors
here and here.


848
00:58:24.631 --> 00:58:27.568
<i>Make certain the digging crew

Mm.

852
00:59:01.835 --> 00:59:05.704
- This stuff tastes like crap.
- Really? Let me try some.


853
00:59:07.674 --> 00:59:10.838
Hey, it is crap. Not bad.

854
00:59:12.137 --> 00:59:16.347
- Somebody needs to feed that fire.
- Dude, I did it last time.


855
00:59:16.433 --> 00:59:19.267
I'm not gonna get it. 
It's not my job.

856
00:59:19.519 --> 00:59:21.511
Well, what about the new guy?

857
00:59:21.605 --> 00:59:23.517
He hasn't contributed yet.

858
00:59:24.274 --> 00:59:27.938
And... you know,
he just died in my arms like that.


859
00:59:28.028 --> 00:59:34.400
I... You know, I don't think he ever once
in his life made his own choice.


860
00:59:36.119 --> 00:59:37.735
I never knew it was like that.

861
00:59:39.039 --> 00:59:40.655
I mean, up in the palace...

862
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:45.376
Well, I guess we just let the General
make all the decisions.


863
00:59:47.881 --> 00:59:49.167
Let me ask you something.

864
00:59:50.091 --> 00:59:52.128
What made you come
to the bar that night?

865
00:59:53.511 --> 00:59:55.798
I guess I was looking for
a little trouble.


866
00:59:55.889 --> 00:59:58.472
Well, trouble's my middle name.

867
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.717
Actually, my middle name is Marion, but...

868
01:00:02.562 --> 01:00:05.475
- I don't want you to spread that around.
- You're pretty strange.


869
01:00:05.565 --> 01:00:07.306
You do know that, don't you?

870
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.984
Well, "strange" is not exactly
the word I would use.


871
01:00:11.071 --> 01:00:14.064
- You know, I...
- I like it. You're not like anyone else.


872
01:00:15.158 --> 01:00:19.027
Actually, now that you mention it,
there is a certain strangeness to me.


873
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.033
I mean, it's a, you know,
kind of a bizarre quality.


874
01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:24.115
Some have said "freak."

875
01:00:24.209 --> 01:00:26.792
But it's, uh, you know, complimentary.

876
01:00:31.466 --> 01:00:34.334
Hey, new guy! We need more wood!

877
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:39.968
I'll be right back.
Just hold that thought.


878
01:00:40.058 --> 01:00:42.015
Whatever it is you were thinking.

879
01:00:43.561 --> 01:00:46.269
Hey, you ever wonder why
they call you guys "pests"?


880
01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:51.108
What if, like,
we're just these tiny little things,


881
01:00:51.194 --> 01:00:56.406
and we're just, like, part of this whole
other huge universe that's, like,


882
01:00:56.491 --> 01:00:59.074
so big we don't even know it exists?

883
01:00:59.536 --> 01:01:02.904
Man, that is so deep.

884
01:01:03.331 --> 01:01:04.162
Perfect!

885
01:01:04.249 --> 01:01:08.209
Nothing like a little manual labor
on the most romantic night of my life.


886
01:01:14.175 --> 01:01:15.175
Hi.

887
01:01:15.427 --> 01:01:18.295
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd drop in.


888
01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:23.433
This is, uh... very bohemian.

889
01:01:23.768 --> 01:01:27.387
Aloha, dude. Welcome to Insec...

890
01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.480
...topia.

891
01:01:28.857 --> 01:01:30.974
Sorry for interrupting.

892
01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:37.234
You see, our princess
has, uh, gone missing,


893
01:01:37.324 --> 01:01:39.486
and we're just sick about it.

894
01:01:41.161 --> 01:01:44.996
She's about yea tall,
fairly easy on the eyes.


895
01:01:45.957 --> 01:01:48.870
- Anybody seen her?
- There she is. That's her. Yeah.


896
01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.834
Don't worry, Princess,
you'll be back home soon.


897
01:01:54.424 --> 01:01:57.292
Listen, Cutter, I'm... 
I'm not going back.

898
01:01:57.802 --> 01:02:00.966
The thing is,
Princess, I got orders.


899
01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:02.348
Orders?

900
01:02:02.515 --> 01:02:05.258
Can't you just once think for yourself?

901
01:02:06.853 --> 01:02:09.266
Well, that was very impressive.

902
01:02:09.731 --> 01:02:10.972
Where's Z?

903
01:02:11.691 --> 01:02:14.024
- Z? He's, uh...
- Dead!


904
01:02:15.445 --> 01:02:16.606
Z's dead.

905
01:02:17.489 --> 01:02:19.071
You don't need to worry about him.

906
01:02:19.157 --> 01:02:23.743
Z's dead. Well, he
was an ant with ideas.

907
01:02:24.412 --> 01:02:25.619
Too bad for him.

908
01:02:26.498 --> 01:02:28.956
Princess, your colony needs you.

909
01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:31.204
Cutter!

910
01:02:31.294 --> 01:02:34.332
- Stop right now! Let go of me!
- Bala!


911
01:02:34.672 --> 01:02:35.788
Stop, you... Hey!

912
01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:37.925
Oh, no.

913
01:02:39.135 --> 01:02:40.421
What am I gonna do?

914
01:02:41.221 --> 01:02:44.259
All right, look, look.
Let's be rational about this.


915
01:02:44.682 --> 01:02:47.595
You know, Bala and I,
you know, she's a princess,


916
01:02:47.685 --> 01:02:51.019
and I'm a soil-relocation engineer.

917
01:02:51.106 --> 01:02:52.722
So wha... You're no... Whew!

918
01:02:53.233 --> 01:02:54.565
On the other hand, uh...

919
01:02:56.027 --> 01:02:57.393
I've gotta go back for her.

920
01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.987
I'll... I'll give you a lift!

921
01:03:00.573 --> 01:03:03.816
S
-S
-S... Whoa! Oh!

922
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.072
It's the least I can do.

923
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:12.333
Besides,
it's what my waddly-kittles would want.


924
01:03:14.796 --> 01:03:18.085
Uh, look,
how about a cup of joe first?


925
01:03:18.174 --> 01:03:21.463
- Well, old boy, saddle up.
- I saw a puddle of coffee over there.


926
01:03:21.553 --> 01:03:24.091
It... It... Whoa!

927
01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.601
Look out!

928
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.272
Wait for my signal.

929
01:03:35.358 --> 01:03:37.190
Ah, Princess!

930
01:03:37.277 --> 01:03:40.111
- You're just in time.
- Take your hands off me.


931
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.864
General, what exactly is going on here?

932
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:47.660
- I demand an explanation.
- I'll explain everything afterwards.


933
01:03:48.246 --> 01:03:50.086
- Is the southeast entrance secure?
- Yes, sir.


934
01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.076
Not afterwards.

935
01:03:52.459 --> 01:03:53.459
Now.

936
01:03:56.754 --> 01:03:58.336
I don't like the way you think,

937
01:03:58.423 --> 01:04:00.915
and I don't like the way
you run this colony.


938
01:04:01.176 --> 01:04:04.089
And I don't like you. 
The wedding is off.

939
01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:06.629
Things are going to change around here.

940
01:04:07.223 --> 01:04:08.464
You're right, Princess.

941
01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:10.678
Things are going to change.

942
01:04:11.102 --> 01:04:12.889
Why don't we make her more comfortable?

943
01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:14.891
She'll be here for a while.

944
01:04:16.816 --> 01:04:18.307
What do you think you're doing?

945
01:04:18.693 --> 01:04:20.901
My mother will have your head!

946
01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:22.979
I doubt that.

947
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:26.232
Ah, you've got a fighter's spirit, Bala.

948
01:04:26.326 --> 01:04:29.114
And that's just what we need
to start our new colony.


949
01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:32.322
We will rinse away all
the filth from our gutters.


950
01:04:32.415 --> 01:04:35.999
We'll start anew,
with you by my side as my queen.


951
01:04:36.878 --> 01:04:38.164
You're crazy.

952
01:04:40.548 --> 01:04:42.756
I believe history will see
things differently.


953
01:04:44.093 --> 01:04:46.426
All right, gentlemen.
Time to take your positions.


954
01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.173
Someday... Someday you'll thank me.

955
01:04:59.275 --> 01:05:01.733
Pull up! Pull up! Ah!

956
01:05:02.612 --> 01:05:04.695
There it is!

957
01:05:08.159 --> 01:05:11.573
Well, then, go get
the woman you love, Z.

958
01:05:12.872 --> 01:05:14.909
So long, Chip. And thanks.

959
01:05:20.505 --> 01:05:21.505
You there!

960
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:22.869
Where do you think you're goin'?

961
01:05:22.924 --> 01:05:25.837
Me? Oh, no, I
was just... You know, I...

962
01:05:25.927 --> 01:05:27.543
You're not supposed to be out here.

963
01:05:28.012 --> 01:05:31.130
All workers are to report
to the tunnel-opening ceremonies.


964
01:05:31.224 --> 01:05:34.433
Oh! Yes, yes, of course!
The-The tunnel-opening ceremonies.


965
01:05:34.519 --> 01:05:37.808
I... Well, I should get going, then.
I...


966
01:05:37.897 --> 01:05:39.013
You know, the...

967
01:05:40.149 --> 01:05:40.980
Hey!

968
01:05:41.067 --> 01:05:44.231
I'm going to the...
the tunnel opening ceremonies.


969
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.312
- I'd better get goin'.
- Get moving.


970
01:05:46.823 --> 01:05:49.315
I'm going to the...
the tunnel-opening ceremonies.


971
01:05:51.744 --> 01:05:54.327
Excuse me, please.
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.


972
01:05:54.414 --> 01:05:57.122
- Hey, worker!
- Opening the tunnel. They need me.


973
01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.450
- I'm the key man.
- Where do you think you're going?


974
01:05:59.544 --> 01:06:01.206
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

975
01:06:05.425 --> 01:06:08.338
Hey, come on! Let me outta here!

976
01:06:08.428 --> 01:06:09.428
Hey!

977
01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:19.853
Gosh, this day just keeps getting
better and better.


978
01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.977
Big trouble!

979
01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:28.024
Are you listening to me out there?
I'm a princess,


980
01:06:28.114 --> 01:06:29.230
damn it!

981
01:06:33.786 --> 01:06:35.869
Wow, your manners haven't improved much.

982
01:06:35.955 --> 01:06:36.741
Z!

983
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:38.781
Whoa! Whoa!

984
01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:42.915
- Oh!
- It's you. You came back for me.


985
01:06:43.004 --> 01:06:47.795
Well, yeah, I came back for you.
You know, I have strong feelings for you.


986
01:06:48.134 --> 01:06:51.252
Let's face it, you're... you're...
you're beautiful. I...


987
01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:56.090
A little combative at times,
but I think we can work on that.


988
01:06:56.184 --> 01:06:57.641
You talk too much.

989
01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:04.728
Gee, I think I'm about to become
the strong, silent type.


990
01:07:06.486 --> 01:07:10.196
Come on. The city's deserted.
We'd better get outta here.


991
01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:13.490
Z... we can't go.

992
01:07:13.576 --> 01:07:17.240
Mandible's insane.
He keeps talking about


993
01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:21.324
washing away the filth
and changing history and...


994
01:07:21.668 --> 01:07:23.876
and I think he's going to try
to kill my mother.


995
01:07:24.462 --> 01:07:27.375
Not just your mother, everyone.

996
01:07:27.715 --> 01:07:29.672
- What's going on?
- Look.


997
01:07:30.343 --> 01:07:31.800
Here we are, safe in the city.

998
01:07:32.553 --> 01:07:34.713
But they're gonna seal
everybody off in the MegaTunnel.


999
01:07:35.139 --> 01:07:37.426
And... here's the lake.

1000
01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:39.345
You're right.

1001
01:07:40.019 --> 01:07:41.555
We can't leave now.

1002
01:07:42.939 --> 01:07:44.521
Come on. We gotta get down there.

1003
01:07:45.525 --> 01:07:48.643
Today is the realization of a dream.

1004
01:07:49.404 --> 01:07:51.111
A dream of a proud colony.

1005
01:07:51.864 --> 01:07:55.904
A pure colony. 
A colony reborn.

1006
01:08:00.373 --> 01:08:03.491
Moments from now this tunnel will open.

1007
01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:08.462
The past will be washed away,
and a new day will dawn.


1008
01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:12.545
A stirring speech, General.

1009
01:08:13.386 --> 01:08:15.719
I only wish my daughter
were here to appreciate it.


1010
01:08:15.805 --> 01:08:18.764
Your Majesty, I know how concerned
you are about Bala.


1011
01:08:19.267 --> 01:08:22.556
But my scouts are on her trail
and it's only a matter of time before...


1012
01:08:22.645 --> 01:08:25.683
General, I don't want to discuss it.
Just find her.


1013
01:08:26.441 --> 01:08:27.557
I will, Your Highness.

1014
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:30.110
Goodbye.

1015
01:08:46.753 --> 01:08:48.119
Seal up the doors.

1016
01:08:49.172 --> 01:08:50.413
Cutter, did you hear me?

1017
01:08:50.923 --> 01:08:53.040
Sir, I've been thinking.

1018
01:08:53.926 --> 01:08:55.588
Do we need to go through with this?

1019
01:08:55.678 --> 01:08:58.261
Look at what these workers have done.

1020
01:08:58.347 --> 01:09:02.261
They got the right stuff.
Isn't there any other way?


1021
01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:04.013
Cutter, you're a fine officer.

1022
01:09:04.103 --> 01:09:06.846
You have discipline, courage, ability.

1023
01:09:07.607 --> 01:09:11.226
But you seem to have a certain weakness
for the lower orders I find disturbing.


1024
01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:16.025
- Now, are you with me?
- Sir, uh... I apologize.


1025
01:09:16.115 --> 01:09:19.358
- All right, then. Seal it up.
- Yes, sir.


1026
01:09:32.298 --> 01:09:34.756
As I look out
on this magnificent tunnel,


1027
01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.376
I am filled with pride.

1028
01:09:38.262 --> 01:09:40.879
- Jump!
- In these difficult times,


1029
01:09:40.973 --> 01:09:44.717
it is a great solace to know
that you, our workers...


1030
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:46.989
Mom! Wait!

1031
01:09:47.188 --> 01:09:48.975
Every worker in the colony is here.

1032
01:09:50.024 --> 01:09:51.704
Hey, wait a minute.
That guy owes me money.


1033
01:09:51.776 --> 01:09:54.359
This tremendous accomplishment
is a testimony to the strength...


1034
01:09:54.445 --> 01:09:57.233
- People! Put your backs into it!
- Go warn your mother.


1035
01:09:57.323 --> 01:09:59.815
I gotta get to those diggers
before they break through!


1036
01:09:59.909 --> 01:10:01.116
There's not enough time!

1037
01:10:01.202 --> 01:10:03.945
Hey, leave the pessimism to me, okay?

1038
01:10:04.831 --> 01:10:08.495
Ow! Ooh! Yeeow!

1039
01:10:08.584 --> 01:10:11.167
Excuse me! Sorry about that. Excuse me.

1040
01:10:11.254 --> 01:10:14.497
In a few moments when our expert diggers
break through to the surface...


1041
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:17.128
- Mom! Mom, stop.
- ...the sun will pour into this...


1042
01:10:17.677 --> 01:10:20.090
Bala! Where've you been?
Are you all right?


1043
01:10:20.179 --> 01:10:23.013
- I'm fine.
- What happened?


1044
01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:25.508
Mother, we're in terrible danger.

1045
01:10:37.113 --> 01:10:39.230
Put your backs into it, people.

1046
01:10:39.824 --> 01:10:42.567
Wait! Hold... Hey, stop digging!

1047
01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.403
- Z? Is that you?
- Weaver, stop!


1048
01:10:45.496 --> 01:10:47.783
Z! You're back!

1049
01:10:47.874 --> 01:10:49.615
- Oh, Z! Oh.
- Weaver!


1050
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:52.372
Z! What's the matter?

1051
01:10:53.254 --> 01:10:56.372
Ho
-Hold up, everyone! Stop! Stop digging!

1052
01:10:56.465 --> 01:10:59.128
- On whose authority?
- On your own authority.


1053
01:10:59.218 --> 01:11:01.426
If you break through that wall,
we're all gonna...


1054
01:11:01.512 --> 01:11:03.925
Drown! This tunnel is going to flood.

1055
01:11:04.015 --> 01:11:06.257
So we've got to
get everyone out of here.

1056
01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:12.104
Look, I got orders,
and those orders say "dig."


1057
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:14.977
What if someone ordered you
to jump off a bridge? Ju-Ju-Ju...


1058
01:11:15.818 --> 01:11:20.313
Brother, I'm asking the wrong guy here.
Look, think for yourselves!


1059
01:11:21.115 --> 01:11:23.277
Gimme that! I've had enough out of you.

1060
01:11:24.035 --> 01:11:25.035
Get back to work!

1061
01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:27.033
What's that noise?

1062
01:11:28.706 --> 01:11:29.706
Uh-oh.

1063
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:32.832
- Let's get outta here!
- Run!


1064
01:11:35.004 --> 01:11:37.417
Run! Run! Keep going!

1065
01:11:38.049 --> 01:11:41.884
Everyone, listen to me.
We've all been deceived.


1066
01:11:43.262 --> 01:11:46.005
We need to calmly head toward the exits.

1067
01:11:46.098 --> 01:11:49.637
- Run for your lives! It's gonna flood!
- No. Don't panic.


1068
01:11:49.727 --> 01:11:53.016
- Don't panic!
- Every ant for himself!


1069
01:12:02.448 --> 01:12:04.610
- All the exits are blocked!
- We're trapped!


1070
01:12:29.433 --> 01:12:31.800
- What are we going to do?
- There's nothing we can do!


1071
01:12:38.818 --> 01:12:41.481
Yes, there is. 
Weaver, give me a leg up!

1072
01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:44.858
Everyone, listen to me!

1073
01:12:44.949 --> 01:12:47.532
- Who the heck are you?
- He's Z!


1074
01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:55.241
Listen, we gotta help each other
get outta here before we all drown!


1075
01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:56.165
How?

1076
01:12:56.252 --> 01:12:58.539
- By making a ladder.
- A ladder!


1077
01:12:58.629 --> 01:13:01.622
Hey, if we built
this, we can do anything.

1078
01:13:01.966 --> 01:13:05.630
- Okay, let's move it!
- I'm on it. All of you, gather round.


1079
01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.006
You, start climbing.

1080
01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:11.594
- Grab my arm.
- All right. Here I go.


1081
01:13:11.684 --> 01:13:13.425
- Go, go, go!
- All right!


1082
01:13:15.813 --> 01:13:17.520
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

1083
01:13:19.859 --> 01:13:22.317
Z, I've gotta help my mom.

1084
01:13:22.945 --> 01:13:23.776
Don't worry.

1085
01:13:23.863 --> 01:13:26.025
I know almost exactly what I'm doing.

1086
01:13:28.868 --> 01:13:30.075
I'll see you at the top.

1087
01:13:34.498 --> 01:13:40.085
Gentlemen, there comes a time
in the evolution of a perfect colony


1088
01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:43.668
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.


1089
01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:47.293
Now is that time.

1090
01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:52.715
<i>Below us right now,
the weak elements of the colony</i>


1091
01:13:52.808 --> 01:13:54.174
<i>are being washed away.</i>

1092
01:13:55.811 --> 01:13:59.805
Oh, my God, we're not gonna make it!

1093
01:13:59.899 --> 01:14:02.812
- We need more ants.
- You two better get up there.


1094
01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:05.235
Weaver, you can't hold it alone.

1095
01:14:05.321 --> 01:14:06.937
Get going!

1096
01:14:07.948 --> 01:14:09.064
Hang in there, buddy.

1097
01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:26.673
- Got it!
- Hurry up! Go, go, go, go!


1098
01:14:30.429 --> 01:14:34.514
Our princess is secured,
and our glorious future is at hand.


1099
01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:36.758
We can all stand proud.

1100
01:14:37.228 --> 01:14:39.845
It is time for a new beginning.

1101
01:14:50.449 --> 01:14:53.613
What the hell is that?

1102
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.112
I think that's the weak elements, sir.

1103
01:14:56.205 --> 01:14:59.744
- Gimme a hand!
- Z! You?


1104
01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:04.954
Let go! Don't you understand?
It's for the good of the colony.


1105
01:15:05.047 --> 01:15:08.256
What are you saying? 
We are the colony!

1106
01:15:12.388 --> 01:15:13.388
Cutter!

1107
01:15:14.098 --> 01:15:14.884
What are you doing?

1108
01:15:14.974 --> 01:15:18.058
Something I should've done
a long time ago.


1109
01:15:18.519 --> 01:15:21.557
This is for the
good of the colony, sir.

1110
01:15:23.566 --> 01:15:25.728
You useless, ungrateful maggot!

1111
01:15:25.818 --> 01:15:28.686
- I am the colony!
- Look out!


1112
01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:32.648
Oof! Ah!

1113
01:15:39.957 --> 01:15:40.957
Z!

1114
01:15:42.418 --> 01:15:45.752
Men, let's move it!
Get these ants up here.


1115
01:15:49.758 --> 01:15:52.216
- Keep it moving.
- Thank goodness we made it.


1116
01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.100
Wait here.

1117
01:16:08.485 --> 01:16:10.568
- Uh! Okay.
- Thank you. Ooh!


1118
01:16:10.863 --> 01:16:11.863
Weaver!

1119
01:16:13.407 --> 01:16:14.523
Where's Z?

1120
01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:24.250
Oh, no.

1121
01:16:25.211 --> 01:16:27.203
Back up, everybody, back up!

1122
01:16:27.296 --> 01:16:31.040
- Give him some air. Back up!
- Z, oh, Z.


1123
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.045
Please wake up.

1124
01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:40.677
Oh, no!

1125
01:16:46.023 --> 01:16:48.891
Huh!

1126
01:16:56.158 --> 01:16:57.239
Yowch!

1127
01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:02.158
You know, Weaver,
you still owe me that dinner.


1128
01:17:03.582 --> 01:17:04.582
Baby love.

1129
01:17:05.918 --> 01:17:08.911
- We made it, Z!
- You da ant!


1130
01:17:09.713 --> 01:17:11.750
- Eh!
- You did it.


1131
01:17:12.216 --> 01:17:13.216
We did it.

1132
01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:16.884
- Fellas, fellas, please.
- Oh! Oh!


1133
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:19.384
This is very embarrassing for me, I...

1134
01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:23.262
On the other hand,
I probably could get used to this.


1135
01:17:26.522 --> 01:17:29.014
<i>There you have it.
Your average "boy meets girl,</i>


1136
01:17:29.108 --> 01:17:33.193
<i>boy likes girl, boy changes
underlying social order" story.</i>


1137
01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.691
<i>So, what else can I tell you?</i>

1138
01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:38.906
<i>We rebuilt the colony.
It's even better than before,</i>


1139
01:17:38.993 --> 01:17:42.452
<i>you know, 'cause now it has
a very large indoor swimming pool.</i>


1140

are thinking of starting a family,</i>

maybe a million or two to begin with.</i>


1142
01:17:51.088 --> 01:17:55.378

<i>He's been putting me in touch
with my inner maggot,</i>


1144
01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:00.219

1145
01:18:00.306 --> 01:18:03.720

I've found my place.</i>
