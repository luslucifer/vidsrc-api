00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:27.094
- You're back!

2
00:04:27.128 --> 00:04:28.370
- Look who I found.

3
00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:29.232
- Margreta.

4
00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:31.266
- Linda, it's been too long!

5
00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:34.646
- It's only been...

6
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.646
- No, too long, I'vedecided,
Linda, too long.


7
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.094
What do you have for us this
time?


8
00:04:41.128 --> 00:04:43.784
- Pieces of Henry Kissinger'sheart.

9
00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:46.128
I'm branching out into fantasy.

10
00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:49.818
- Wonderful, only you
couldmake something wonderful


11
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.301
out of Henry Kissinger's heart.

12
00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:54.060
Oh let me show you.

13
00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.128
Would you like some coffee?

14
00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:58.577
- God, why do I ever leave?

15
00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:03.646
- Bread Factory.

16
00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:06.542
Just give me a second.

17
00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:08.749
You wanna see Mahagonny.

18
00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:10.094
You know the opera?

19
00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:13.060
Yes, I like it, too, I
just wanted to be sure


20
00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:14.473
you knew what you were in for.

21
00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:17.473
And your name is?

22
00:05:17.508 --> 00:05:19.197
Toni with an I.

23
00:05:20.163 --> 00:05:22.232
And do I know you, Toni?

24
00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:25.473
Well, okay then, welcome.

25
00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:28.060
And you need to sit where?

26
00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:31.232
You have what kind of condition?

27
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:35.749
How do you spell that?

28
00:05:35.784 --> 00:05:38.611
Just so when we're in
theambulance, I can let them know.


29
00:05:55.784 --> 00:05:56.784
- There's nothing.

30
00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:00.784
- There are many things.

31
00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:02.335
- No note, no clue.

32
00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:06.163
I can't figure out where
shewent, if something happened.


33
00:06:07.542 --> 00:06:09.335
- These, what are these?

34
00:06:10.232 --> 00:06:13.335
- Bills that came in,
I don'tknow what to do with them.


35
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:18.473
- You have Jan's checks?

36
00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:21.646
- Yeah, but like I don't know

37
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.301
if there's money in the
accounts or what.


38
00:06:27.646 --> 00:06:32.577
- Well, you are a journalist.

39
00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:53.518
- Hi, I'm calling from
the Checkford Journal.


40
00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:54.542
We have a check...

41
00:06:55.473 --> 00:06:57.335
Oh hi, Bill.

42
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.163
Yeah, yeah, I'm good what
about you?


43
00:07:01.335 --> 00:07:03.163
I don't know if you heard,

44
00:07:03.197 --> 00:07:05.611
but Jan, she's kind of gonemissing.

45
00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.232
Yeah, yeah, no one really knows.

46
00:07:11.128 --> 00:07:13.715
You haven't seen her lately, have you?

47
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:14.818
Have you seen her lately?

48
00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:20.197
Okay, and when was that?

49
00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:21.749
And did she say anything then?

50
00:07:21.784 --> 00:07:23.060
Like anything unusual?

51
00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:26.818
Okay, yeah.

52
00:07:28.784 --> 00:07:31.060
Anyway, we're like getting all
these bills


53
00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:32.104
and I didn't know if there'smoney

54
00:07:32.128 --> 00:07:33.542
in the account to pay them or?

55
00:07:34.404 --> 00:07:36.197
Do I need...

56
00:07:36.232 --> 00:07:39.060
Sure, he's checking,
hesays he can only tell me.


57
00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:41.439
Hello? Yeah, yeah I'm here.

58
00:07:43.404 --> 00:07:47.060
I am? He said I'm on the
account.


59
00:07:48.473 --> 00:07:49.611
So I can write checks?

60
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.749
Okay, do you know when she did
that?


61
00:07:58.473 --> 00:08:00.404
So that's the date when it waseffective,

62
00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:01.719
but do you know when she did it?

63
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:03.611
And what would she have to do?

64
00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:05.611
Just send you guys a form orsomething?

65
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:09.301
She could just talk to someone?

66
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.577
Okay, do you know who shetalked to?

67
00:08:14.715 --> 00:08:17.370
Yeah, yeah can you ask
andsee if anyone remembers?


68
00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:20.542
Thank you, yeah that'd
be really great to know.


69
00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:25.784
So just my signature?

70
00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:30.818
Okay yeah, yeah sure,
I'll come by later today.


71
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.163
And sorry, Bill, can
you check the account.


72
00:08:33.197 --> 00:08:37.370
Is it just the one the 3314 one?

73
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.094
Yeah, yeah can you just
check it and tell me


74
00:08:40.128 --> 00:08:41.784
how much is left, just so I don't...

75
00:08:41.818 --> 00:08:42.818
Right.

76
00:08:44.818 --> 00:08:47.404
Sorry? Sorry, how much?

77
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.370
For the newspaper?

78
00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:58.473
- You can pay these bills?

79
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.749
- Yeah, we can totally pay thebills.

80
00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:07.060
- What do you want?

81
00:09:07.094 --> 00:09:08.128
You got the vote.

82
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.232
What, I didn't invite you in!

83
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.128
You want something, you get it
yourself.


84
00:09:44.128 --> 00:09:46.266
- You didn't deserve it, Alec.

85
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:48.163
All your years with the mayor.

86
00:09:48.197 --> 00:09:50.749
And it's crummy that you
had to hear it from me.


87
00:09:55.749 --> 00:09:56.818
What are you gonna do?

88
00:09:58.646 --> 00:09:59.646
- Not your problem.

89
00:10:05.818 --> 00:10:06.818
I don't know.

90
00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:12.335
I can do tech!

91
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.301
He didn't have to bring
in that other woman!


92
00:10:14.335 --> 00:10:16.508
I can run a tech program
for the goddamn city.


93
00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:18.818
Who can run a tech programbetter than me?

94
00:10:20.404 --> 00:10:23.370
- I've met that woman
who'srecruiting tech companies for,


95
00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:25.715
God, what do they call it?

96
00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:29.232
- I don't care.

97
00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:31.818
- What's our mayor gotten
himself into?


98
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.715
- Not my mayor, not my
problem, not anymore.


99
00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:38.646
It's good to stick it to
'emone last time with the vote.


100
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.128
They don't get everything!

101
00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:42.818
- Thanks for that, Alec.

102
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.749
- Didn't do it for you.

103
00:10:44.784 --> 00:10:50.646
- A girl can dream.

104
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.094
There's got to be somebody
else you could work for.


105
00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:56.439
- Nobody else left, 
I tookcare of that.

106
00:10:56.473 --> 00:10:57.473
There's nobody else.

107
00:11:02.404 --> 00:11:07.060
- All that fighting,
so much time fighting.


108
00:11:08.128 --> 00:11:09.370
Somehow we both lost.

109
00:11:11.473 --> 00:11:14.749
- We're ancient, theworld's
not ours anymore.


110
00:11:14.784 --> 00:11:16.335
Good talk, Dorothea.

111
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.784
- So you want a job?

112
00:11:20.818 --> 00:11:21.818
- Working for you?

113
00:11:22.784 --> 00:11:24.266
- You get to yell at people.

114
00:11:33.232 --> 00:11:34.301
- Where you going?

115
00:11:34.335 --> 00:11:35.508
- Sorry?

116
00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:37.266
- You going here to this place?

117
00:11:37.301 --> 00:11:39.335
- Uh, we're going...

118
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.508
- Can't park here.

119
00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:44.749
Go to the Bread Factoryor
get out, factory only.


120
00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:48.749
That's it, go on, go on!

121
00:11:50.197 --> 00:11:51.197
Good!

122
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.749
- Did you bring Linda here for
me?


123
00:12:09.473 --> 00:12:10.715
- Marvin had to reschedule so...

124
00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:12.646
- I know.

125
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.508
I know, but then you
bring Linda here for me?


126
00:12:19.335 --> 00:12:20.715
You did, thank you.

127
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.680
I'm ready.

128
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.611
I'm ready to rehearse.

129
00:12:33.646 --> 00:12:35.404
We have to get back to the play.

130
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.060
- You're sure you're...

131
00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:41.163
- We are so behind, so
behind the schedule.


132
00:12:42.646 --> 00:12:46.060
We'll have to start over orthe role,

133
00:12:46.094 --> 00:12:48.335
I will forgot, it will
fall out of my head.


134
00:12:49.784 --> 00:12:51.611
How will we find a new Polyxena?

135
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.818
- Fine, I'll do it.

136
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.163
- You will not play my daughter.

137
00:12:59.197 --> 00:13:00.370
- Elsa will do it.
- No.


138
00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:01.404
- She translated it.
- No.


139
00:13:01.439 --> 00:13:02.449
- She knows all the lines.

140
00:13:02.473 --> 00:13:03.508
- Oh no please, no.

141
00:13:03.542 --> 00:13:05.439
- I'll talk to her about it
tomorrow.


142
00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:08.715
- You will not say this toher, Dorothea.

143
00:13:08.749 --> 00:13:11.128
Not even as a joke.

144
00:13:11.163 --> 00:13:13.473
She is such a nervous woman.

145
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.128
Can you imagine?

146
00:13:18.163 --> 00:13:20.542
Promise me you will notsay
this to her, Dorothea.


147
00:13:20.577 --> 00:13:21.577
- I promise.

148
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.335
- She may never come back.

149
00:13:27.749 --> 00:13:28.749
- What about Wendy?

150
00:13:28.784 --> 00:13:29.680
- No.

151
00:13:29.715 --> 00:13:32.404
- No?
- No, she is very smart.


152
00:13:32.439 --> 00:13:34.301
But we cannot cast the cat.

153
00:14:19.094 --> 00:14:21.335
- Fuck!

154
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.301
Sorry, Sir Walter, what
are you doing here?


155
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.680
How'd you get in?

156
00:14:32.508 --> 00:14:33.749
- I don't remember.

157
00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:37.508
- Want some coffee?

158
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.163
- Could I trouble you for some
tea?


159
00:14:41.197 --> 00:14:43.060
- Sorry, I don't think Jandrank tea.

160
00:14:48.508 --> 00:14:49.508
Checkford Journal.

161
00:14:50.577 --> 00:14:52.473
Two o'clock, yup.

162
00:14:54.197 --> 00:14:55.577
- Is this your network, Journal?

163
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:56.818
- Yeah.

164
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.680
- What's the password?

165
00:14:57.715 --> 00:14:58.577
- Journal.

166
00:14:58.611 --> 00:14:59.439
- Thanks, man.

167
00:14:59.473 --> 00:15:01.335
- No problem, you want coffee?

168
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.370
- Thanks, man.

169
00:15:05.163 --> 00:15:05.818
- Can you grab some water?

170
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.680
It's just down the hall.

171
00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:07.542
- Cool.

172
00:15:07.577 --> 00:15:08.577
- Checkford Journal.

173
00:15:09.611 --> 00:15:11.128
- You really don't know?

174
00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:12.266
- No, sorry.

175
00:15:12.301 --> 00:15:13.749
- Darren will know.

176
00:15:13.784 --> 00:15:16.128
Darren, you know who Kissinger
is, right?


177
00:15:17.163 --> 00:15:19.197
- Sounds really familiar.

178
00:15:19.232 --> 00:15:20.646
- Really? Maybe Rasputin?

179
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.094
You know who Rasputin was?

180
00:15:23.128 --> 00:15:25.266
- The guy with the spinningwheel?

181
00:15:25.301 --> 00:15:27.197
- That's Rumpelstiltskin.

182
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.197
- That's right.

183
00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:32.266
Wait, Henry Kissinger, of
course I know who he is.


184
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:33.680
You didn't say Henry.

185
00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:34.875
Why are we talking about him?

186
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.060
- It's Linda's exhibit.

187
00:15:36.094 --> 00:15:37.301
- I'm doing an installation.

188
00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:39.094
It's called Henry Kissinger's
Heart.


189
00:15:39.128 --> 00:15:41.060
- Oh, did he have a heartproblem?

190
00:15:41.094 --> 00:15:43.163
- Yes, yes, he did.

191
00:15:44.646 --> 00:15:47.060
- Dima will know who Rasputin
is.


192
00:15:47.094 --> 00:15:48.173
- Why are we talking aboutRasputin?

193
00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.646
- Dima is Russian, of coursehe knows.

194
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.404
- Well that's actually so funny.

195
00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:54.404
I was just reading those stories

196
00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:56.439
that Teffi wrote about meetinghim.

197
00:15:56.473 --> 00:15:57.680
- Who's Teffi?

198
00:15:57.715 --> 00:16:00.680
- Oh my God, you don't know
who Teffi is?


199
00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:02.577
- That was good, Teresa.

200
00:16:03.577 --> 00:16:04.577
- Teresa!

201
00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:07.646
- What?

202
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.163
- Teresa.

203
00:16:09.197 --> 00:16:11.197
- Ah!

204
00:16:11.232 --> 00:16:14.128
- Okay, whoa, like youguys
were making more sense


205
00:16:14.163 --> 00:16:15.587
when you were talking about
Kissinger.


206
00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:17.128
- How would you
like to be ina play?

207
00:16:17.163 --> 00:16:18.266
- You're kidding.

208
00:16:18.301 --> 00:16:20.128
- No, you would be perfect.

209
00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:21.242
- Okay, you're definitely
kidding.


210
00:16:21.266 --> 00:16:22.587
What do I know about being ina play?

211
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:23.691
- You would play my daughter.

212
00:16:23.715 --> 00:16:26.197
- Dima will do it, he's theartsy one.

213
00:16:26.232 --> 00:16:28.060
- Oh Teresa, you would beperfect.

214
00:16:28.094 --> 00:16:30.542
You have a strong spirit,
just like the character.


215
00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:33.060
- So this is how you
geteveryone to be in your plays?


216
00:16:33.094 --> 00:16:34.060
- It's a right of passage.

217
00:16:34.094 --> 00:16:35.715
Every citizen of Checkford
appears


218
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:37.508
on the stage at the BreadFactory.

219
00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:40.542
- Teresa, you would be
soperfect to play Polyxena.


220
00:16:40.577 --> 00:16:42.301
- My name would be Polyxena?

221
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.818
- Yes, and you die, but
beautiful.


222
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.656
- Ooo, I've always
wanted to die beautiful.


223
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.508
- So you'll do it!

224
00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:49.060
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

225
00:16:49.094 --> 00:16:50.473
I don't know if Sam is gonna...

226
00:16:50.508 --> 00:16:53.370
- I'll talk to him.
- Dorothea!


227
00:16:53.404 --> 00:16:56.266
- This is real, this is
happening!


228
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:57.301
- I don't...

229
00:16:57.335 --> 00:16:59.197
- Don't resist the Greta.
- But I haven't,


230
00:16:59.232 --> 00:17:00.542
I don't, look, things are busy.

231
00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:03.060
- How can you resist the Greta?

232
00:17:19.232 --> 00:17:20.163
- You know him?

233
00:17:20.197 --> 00:17:22.163
- No, must be one of the tech
guys.


234
00:17:24.301 --> 00:17:25.197
- You alright, Sam?

235
00:17:25.232 --> 00:17:27.473
- Yeah, just a little tired.

236
00:17:27.508 --> 00:17:30.508
- Yeah, and things at home?

237
00:17:31.577 --> 00:17:34.197
- I don't really know.

238
00:17:34.232 --> 00:17:38.577
- Well if you ever needcompany,
you know where we are.


239
00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:40.335
We'd love to see you.

240
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.232
- Yeah.

241
00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:44.197
- We'll even cook for you for
a change.


242
00:17:45.301 --> 00:17:47.301
- Alright, yeah, thanks.

243
00:17:48.301 --> 00:17:49.415
- Well it's the least I can do

244
00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:52.370
for how I'm about to
complicate your life.


245
00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:53.818
- Okay.

246
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.266
- We'd like Teresa to be in
the play.


247
00:17:56.301 --> 00:17:57.439
- Because of Julie?

248
00:17:57.473 --> 00:17:59.715
- Yeah, in Julie's role.

249
00:17:59.749 --> 00:18:00.818
- Sorry about that.

250
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.749
- No, you don't have to be
sorry.


251
00:18:02.784 --> 00:18:04.197
Just tell me straight.

252
00:18:04.232 --> 00:18:07.370
Will it be a problem for
you if she does the play?


253
00:18:07.404 --> 00:18:10.060
- Shouldn't be, it's mostly
nights right?


254
00:18:10.094 --> 00:18:12.542
She works days, it'll be
harder for her than me.


255
00:18:14.404 --> 00:18:17.060
- All right, we'll give it atry.

256
00:18:18.094 --> 00:18:20.542
But let me know if it becomesa problem.

257
00:18:20.577 --> 00:18:21.577
- Sure.

258

- Okay, Joe's coming out
there to meet you now.


330
00:22:57.715 --> 00:23:00.439
Omar, your aunt lives by
the Feeling Place, right?


331
00:23:00.473 --> 00:23:01.542
- Yeah.

332
00:23:01.577 --> 00:23:03.457
- Okay, cool, like from
her place, can you see...


333
00:23:05.094 --> 00:23:06.094
Checkford Journal.

334
00:23:07.232 --> 00:23:08.232
Wait, what happened?

335
00:23:09.715 --> 00:23:12.301
Okay, how late?

336
00:23:12.335 --> 00:23:14.680
Well no they'll adjourn
by then if no one...


337
00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:18.232
No, go I, go, I'll send
someone to stall.


338
00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:21.404
Okay, you want something to do?

339
00:23:21.439 --> 00:23:22.266
- Yes!

340
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:23.404
- Okay, you good at math?

341
00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:24.577
- No!

342
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:26.266
- Okay, do you have money?

343
00:23:26.301 --> 00:23:27.715
- Do I look like I have money?

344
00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:30.060
- Okay, pretend you did.

345
00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:31.128
- Cool.

346
00:23:31.163 --> 00:23:32.449
- And then they just took it
all from you.


347
00:23:32.473 --> 00:23:33.542
- They did what?

348
00:23:33.577 --> 00:23:34.794
- Right now you can't
get it back but at least


349
00:23:34.818 --> 00:23:36.518
they can tell you what
they'regonna do with it, right?


350
00:23:36.542 --> 00:23:38.266
- Uh, yeah.

351
00:23:38.301 --> 00:23:39.691
- Okay, I'm texting you where
to go.


352
00:23:39.715 --> 00:23:41.060
In the room there's a mic.

353
00:23:41.094 --> 00:23:42.163
Go to the mic and find out

354
00:23:42.197 --> 00:23:44.094
what they're doing with your money, okay?

355
00:23:44.128 --> 00:23:46.439
Keep asking questions
until Marek gets there.


356
00:23:46.473 --> 00:23:49.404
Keep asking questions, andthey're
not allowed to go home.


357
00:24:09.542 --> 00:24:11.197
- Music do I hear?

358
00:24:18.784 --> 00:24:21.439
How the thoughts keep time.

359
00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:27.542
Tell me my friend by samovar,

360
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.060
where has she gone?

361
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.094
- Which she do you mean?

362
00:24:32.128 --> 00:24:35.060
- She, she who sat over there.

363
00:24:35.094 --> 00:24:38.128
- I don't believe a she sat
there.


364
00:24:38.163 --> 00:24:40.404
Those are all boys.

365
00:24:42.646 --> 00:24:43.646
- Tragedy.

366
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.715
No, there was a she.

367
00:24:49.818 --> 00:24:51.197
Chekhov's woman.

368
00:24:52.094 --> 00:24:53.266
- Chekhov's woman?

369
00:24:55.508 --> 00:24:56.680
You've lost me.

370
00:24:58.542 --> 00:25:00.232
- Not only you my friend.

371
00:25:02.197 --> 00:25:03.197
So many.

372
00:25:05.163 --> 00:25:07.094
I have lost so many.

373
00:25:11.611 --> 00:25:12.749
Another samovar.

374
00:25:14.128 --> 00:25:16.818
I remember a time by another
samovar,


375
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.370
like this, but larger.

376
00:25:19.715 --> 00:25:21.370
All was larger then.

377
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:26.508
Those summer days.

378
00:25:26.542 --> 00:25:28.370
They never wanted to end, did
they?


379
00:25:30.335 --> 00:25:32.646
Those country nights.

380
00:25:34.197 --> 00:25:35.473
How they glowed.

381
00:25:37.508 --> 00:25:42.508
Inspiring a love that would
not sleep.


382
00:25:46.335 --> 00:25:48.060
That was the time of my Tanya.

383
00:25:50.818 --> 00:25:52.370
Have I told you of Tanya?

384
00:25:53.646 --> 00:25:58.128
- No, but you will.

385
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.611
- She was the doctor's daughter.

386
00:26:03.542 --> 00:26:07.749
When they first arrived,
she and the doctor,


387
00:26:09.163 --> 00:26:11.335
I feared she was the doctor'syoung wife.

388
00:26:13.232 --> 00:26:16.646
I saw her and thought I am lost.

389
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.749
She is the doctor's young wife.

390
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.749
But no, she was the
daughter and unattached.


391
00:26:26.784 --> 00:26:30.508
And I immediately made
plans to extend my stay.


392
00:26:33.439 --> 00:26:34.784
At the time I was staying

393
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.680
with my cousin called Sigizmund.

394
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:41.680
- Is it important?

395
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.266
- What?

396
00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:46.404
- That he is called Sigizmund.

397
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.646
- I'm sure it was to him.

398
00:26:49.715 --> 00:26:51.266
But once she arrived,

399
00:26:53.439 --> 00:26:55.128
I thought no more of him.

400
00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:04.060
She spoke so little in
the beginning, this Tanya.


401
00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.094
She was hard to know.

402
00:27:09.473 --> 00:27:13.335
She agreed to come with mefor
walks among the fir trees.


403
00:27:14.577 --> 00:27:15.784
But she stayed silent.

404
00:27:18.611 --> 00:27:20.749
And then one day

405
00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:24.370
while she was tending the
samovar,


406
00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:29.128
her back to me, she asked me aquestion.

407
00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.577
I remember it all.

408
00:27:34.335 --> 00:27:36.335
The shape of her back.

409
00:27:37.818 --> 00:27:39.404
Like a question itself.

410
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.577
She asked what I, esteemed
actor,


411
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.577
thought of the plays of Lemkov.

412
00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:50.784
- Lemkov?

413
00:27:50.818 --> 00:27:52.680
- Lemkov!

414
00:27:53.749 --> 00:27:55.060
Never heard of the man.

415
00:27:58.508 --> 00:28:03.508
Finally my Tanya was wishing
to engage me,


416
00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:06.646
and I could give her nothing.

417
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.680
She named the plays.

418
00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:10.749
I knew none.

419
00:28:12.163 --> 00:28:14.715
How, I asked, might one
encounter


420
00:28:14.749 --> 00:28:16.646
the great man's manuscripts

421
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.335
for I desired to know

422
00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:22.611
the man she regarded so highly.

423
00:28:24.439 --> 00:28:27.370
She revealed that she
had copies of his plays


424
00:28:27.404 --> 00:28:30.473
but they were at her home.

425
00:28:32.094 --> 00:28:34.163
And her home was far away.

426
00:28:36.646 --> 00:28:37.646
However.

427
00:28:39.197 --> 00:28:41.749
- However.

428
00:28:41.784 --> 00:28:45.784
- However, she had committed

429
00:28:45.818 --> 00:28:47.818
certain scripts to memory.

430
00:28:49.577 --> 00:28:53.611
And if I so desired she would
teach me


431
00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:56.611
the monologues and dialogueson our walks.

432
00:28:59.646 --> 00:29:04.197
I so desired.

433
00:29:08.232 --> 00:29:12.473
And so it was that Tanya,
the doctor's daughter, and I


434
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:18.128
we began these little dramas
on our walks.


435
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.266
So many lives we lived.

436
00:29:25.301 --> 00:29:28.439
The emotional history we
amassed.


437
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.128
The words were brilliant.

438
00:29:39.715 --> 00:29:41.060
And so was she.

439
00:29:41.094 --> 00:29:43.646
If anyone belonged on the stage,

440
00:29:45.266 --> 00:29:46.301
it was she.

441
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:53.301
How I fantasized about
our touring the world.


442
00:29:55.094 --> 00:29:58.715
Performing to an
audienceof more than trees.


443
00:30:04.473 --> 00:30:06.060
But it was not to be.

444
00:30:08.577 --> 00:30:12.060
For all our spiritual
coupling that season,


445
00:30:14.232 --> 00:30:15.784
for all my devotion to her,

446
00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:19.508
her position was an impossibleone.

447
00:30:20.577 --> 00:30:21.760
For she was not only
the doctor's daughter,


448
00:30:21.784 --> 00:30:24.680
she was also his assistant.

449
00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.060
And as she was my superior

450
00:30:32.094 --> 00:30:34.197
so was she his.

451
00:30:34.232 --> 00:30:36.818
The doctor without herwould
be a complete failure.


452
00:30:39.232 --> 00:30:40.818
So tight was his grip on her,

453
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.473
she would never be free of him.

454
00:30:46.818 --> 00:30:51.611
The gods let giants

455
00:30:51.646 --> 00:30:59.128
walk among us.

456
00:30:59.163 --> 00:31:02.232
They give us a chance to save
ourselves


457
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.611
and watch as we choke themwith our fears

458
00:31:13.508 --> 00:31:16.060
chain them to our pettiness.

459
00:31:19.784 --> 00:31:24.473
- And what was to become ofyoung Tanya?

460
00:31:28.232 --> 00:31:29.404
- Of Tanya?

461
00:31:29.439 --> 00:31:31.680
- Yes, Tanya.

462
00:31:36.715 --> 00:31:40.439
- Alas, she died in the War of

463
00:31:43.094 --> 00:31:45.404
I lost my one true love

464
00:31:46.818 --> 00:31:48.335
in the War of 1812.

465
00:31:51.197 --> 00:31:52.473
Let me never forget.

466
00:31:54.163 --> 00:31:58.542
God, let me keep the memory

467
00:31:58.577 --> 00:31:59.680
of my dear Tanya.

468
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:01.680
Of our walks.

469
00:32:03.232 --> 00:32:06.646
Oh God you great shower

470
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.784
and subtractor of beautiful
things


471
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:14.577
let me keep this one
miraculous memory!


472
00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.749
- So Teresa, this is yourfirst entrance.

473
00:32:20.784 --> 00:32:23.749
It's an easy one, your
mother calls to you.


474
00:32:23.784 --> 00:32:26.301
Euripides has written in yourcue.

475
00:32:26.335 --> 00:32:27.646
So she says...

476
00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.404
- O daughter, O child of
a most unfortunate mother.


477
00:32:31.439 --> 00:32:34.266
Come out now, come out of the
house.


478
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:35.715
- And that's you, got it?

479
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.301
- When she says, come
out now, I come out.

480
00:32:40.335 --> 00:32:41.646
Yeah, I think I got it.

481
00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.335
- Okay, well it can pile on
pretty fast,


482
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.060
so you want to start slow.

483
00:32:46.094 --> 00:32:49.370
- Okay, but I'm a grown up.

484
00:32:49.404 --> 00:32:51.094
- Well that's a rarity in ourwork.

485
00:32:51.128 --> 00:32:53.163
- Don't say that.

486
00:32:53.197 --> 00:32:55.301
- Greta is a rarity too.

487
00:32:55.335 --> 00:32:58.128
Look, a whole room of rarities.

488
00:32:58.163 --> 00:33:00.094
So this first time around,

489
00:33:00.128 --> 00:33:02.197
you just do what you want.

490
00:33:02.232 --> 00:33:05.370
And we'll see what happens
and take it from there.


491
00:33:05.404 --> 00:33:07.197
From O daughter, O child.

492
00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:17.060
- O daughter, O child of
a most unfortunate mother


493
00:33:17.094 --> 00:33:20.128
come out now, come out of the
house.


494
00:33:20.163 --> 00:33:23.818
Come and hear your
mother'svoice, oh my child.


495
00:33:25.784 --> 00:33:29.163
- Mother why are you shouting?

496
00:33:29.197 --> 00:33:31.611
What's next, what's the news?

497
00:33:31.646 --> 00:33:33.611
Mother, you've startled
me out of the house


498
00:33:33.646 --> 00:33:35.094
like a terrified bird.

499
00:33:35.128 --> 00:33:36.818
- Alas, my child.

500
00:33:38.784 --> 00:33:41.128
- What is this unholy prelude
to sorrow?


501
00:33:41.163 --> 00:33:43.266
- Ah, your life.

502
00:33:43.301 --> 00:33:48.163
- Speak out, please, conceal
it no longer.


503
00:33:48.197 --> 00:33:52.232
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, mother.

504
00:33:52.266 --> 00:33:53.266
Why are you weeping?

505
00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:54.473
- My child...

506
00:33:54.508 --> 00:33:56.784
- Great, let's stop there.

507
00:33:56.818 --> 00:33:57.715
Let's do it again.

508
00:33:57.749 --> 00:34:00.094
And this time around you don't
have


509
00:34:00.128 --> 00:34:02.197
to be so respectful of mama.

510
00:34:02.232 --> 00:34:04.060
You're letting her finish

511
00:34:04.094 --> 00:34:06.266
and then there's a
littlespace before your line.


512
00:34:06.301 --> 00:34:08.439
- Oh really, sorry, I didn'tknow.

513
00:34:08.473 --> 00:34:09.749
- No, don't be sorry.

514
00:34:09.784 --> 00:34:13.646
Just try it again and thistime
just have a conversation.


515
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.232
Okay? Okay.

516
00:34:18.128 --> 00:34:21.370
- O daughter, O child of
a most unfortunate mother


517
00:34:22.473 --> 00:34:24.784
come out now, come out of the
house.


518
00:34:25.991 --> 00:34:29.060
Come and hear your mother's
voice, oh my child.


519
00:34:29.094 --> 00:34:31.404
- Sorry, you'rewhistling?

520
00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:32.439
- Yes.

521
00:34:33.542 --> 00:34:34.370
- On purpose?

522
00:34:34.404 --> 00:34:35.646
- Yes.

523
00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.784
- Oh?

524
00:34:36.818 --> 00:34:38.266
- It says.

525
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:40.060
- It says to whistle?

526
00:34:40.094 --> 00:34:41.749
- Well it says she enters
singing.


527
00:34:41.784 --> 00:34:43.064
I didn't know what you wanted me

528
00:34:43.094 --> 00:34:44.370
to sing so I just whistled.

529
00:34:44.404 --> 00:34:46.680
- It does say she enters
singing.


530
00:34:46.715 --> 00:34:49.542
- Great, we won't worry aboutthat now.

531
00:34:51.094 --> 00:34:52.680
- Oh, okay.

532
00:34:53.749 --> 00:34:56.266
- Well we'll get there, once
more.


533
00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:04.060
- O daughter, O child of
a most unfortunate mother


534
00:35:04.094 --> 00:35:07.370
come out now, come out of the
house.


535
00:35:07.404 --> 00:35:10.818
Come and hear your
mother'svoice, oh my child.


536
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.335
- Mother, why are you shouting?

537
00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.094
What's next, what's the news?

538
00:35:14.128 --> 00:35:16.232
Mother, you've startled
me out of the house


539
00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:17.542
like a terrified bird.

540
00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:19.094
- Alas, my...
- What is this unholy


541
00:35:19.128 --> 00:35:20.335
prelude to sorrow?

542
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.577
- Ah your...
- Speak out.


543
00:35:21.611 --> 00:35:24.577
- Great, sorry, my fault.

544
00:35:24.611 --> 00:35:27.060
Conversation means
somethingdifferent to everyone.


545
00:35:27.094 --> 00:35:30.439
So you don't need to interrupt.

546
00:35:38.473 --> 00:35:39.439
- Am I in trouble?

547
00:35:39.473 --> 00:35:42.060
- No, no, it's just that Gretaknows

548
00:35:42.094 --> 00:35:43.542
I can't resist her coming close.

549
00:35:43.577 --> 00:35:45.232
But this is a good idea.

550
00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:49.060
Let's just forget all
aboutwho's talking and how fast.


551
00:35:49.094 --> 00:35:51.784
And Greta's gonna,

552
00:35:51.818 --> 00:35:53.197
well, we'll make it simple.

553
00:35:53.232 --> 00:35:55.577
Greta's going to give
yousomething like a performance.


554
00:35:55.611 --> 00:35:58.197
- Something like a performance?

555
00:35:58.232 --> 00:36:00.060
- Greta's going to transcendperformance

556
00:36:00.094 --> 00:36:05.094
and you just feel what's
happening,


557
00:36:05.404 --> 00:36:09.163
and respond, react, go with it.

558
00:36:09.197 --> 00:36:10.611
If you're worried for her, goto her

559
00:36:10.646 --> 00:36:14.508
and whatever you want,
whatever makes sense.


560
00:36:16.715 --> 00:36:17.784
- Sure.

561
00:36:17.818 --> 00:36:21.060
- Okay, so we're going
to back up a little bit.


562
00:36:22.197 --> 00:36:24.508
And get more of a runway intothe scene.

563
00:36:24.542 --> 00:36:26.335
And we're going to...

564
00:36:28.197 --> 00:36:30.611
146.

565
00:36:30.646 --> 00:36:32.473
- Yes, yes, that is perfect.

566
00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:38.370
- Alright, here we go.

567
00:36:41.508 --> 00:36:43.060
Oh! Whistle for me again.

568
00:36:47.818 --> 00:36:49.094
Slower.

569
00:36:53.818 --> 00:36:54.818
Fewer gaps.

570
00:37:00.128 --> 00:37:02.542
You're right, she'swhistling
when she enters.


571
00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:07.232
Or actually Sandra is
whistling, Sandra?


572
00:37:14.611 --> 00:37:16.197
And you know when?

573
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.542
Okay, here we go.

574
00:37:26.266 --> 00:37:30.060
- Oh unhappy me, what cry,

575
00:37:30.094 --> 00:37:32.577
what lament, what weeping

576
00:37:32.611 --> 00:37:35.128
can help an old woman unsaved?

577
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.094
Unsalved, enslaved.

578
00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:42.094
Unbearable, unendurable.

579
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.060
Who defends me?

580
00:37:47.094 --> 00:37:51.163
What family, what city?

581
00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:54.128
The old man is gone.

582
00:37:55.784 --> 00:37:57.060
The children are gone.

583
00:37:58.646 --> 00:38:00.680
I don't know which direction
to step.


584
00:38:01.749 --> 00:38:04.611
This way? That way?

585
00:38:04.646 --> 00:38:06.301
Where will I be safe?

586
00:38:07.163 --> 00:38:11.370
What god, what divinity stands
at my side?


587
00:38:13.094 --> 00:38:17.749
O daughters of Troy
bearing tidings of pain


588
00:38:19.128 --> 00:38:22.232
you have borne so much pain

589
00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:26.128
you've destroyed me.

590
00:38:26.163 --> 00:38:29.060
Destroyed me.

591
00:38:29.094 --> 00:38:32.439
The daylight no longer
means anything to me.


592
00:38:34.749 --> 00:38:37.508
My life means nothing now.

593
00:38:44.335 --> 00:38:47.163
This way, poor old foot.

594
00:38:48.818 --> 00:38:50.266
Carry an old woman

595
00:38:50.301 --> 00:38:54.301
to this homestead, this tent.

596
00:38:57.749 --> 00:39:01.646
O daughter, O child of
a most unfortunate woman


597
00:39:03.094 --> 00:39:05.611
come out of the house, comeout now,

598
00:39:05.646 --> 00:39:08.818
come and hear your
mother'svoice, oh my child.


599
00:39:11.439 --> 00:39:13.197
- Mother, why are you shouting?

600
00:39:15.094 --> 00:39:17.370
What news, what's next?

601
00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:19.577
Mother, you've startled me

602
00:39:19.611 --> 00:39:21.818
out of the house like a
terrified bird.


603
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.266
- Alas, my child.

604
00:39:24.715 --> 00:39:27.439
- What is this unholy prelude
to sorrow?


605
00:39:27.473 --> 00:39:29.473
- Ah, your life.

606
00:39:29.508 --> 00:39:31.749
- Speak out!

607
00:39:31.784 --> 00:39:34.266
Please, conceal it no longer.

608
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.197
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, mother.

609
00:39:40.232 --> 00:39:41.473
Why are you weeping?

610
00:39:41.508 --> 00:39:45.060
- My child O child,

611
00:39:45.094 --> 00:39:47.266
of a most unhappy mother.

612
00:39:49.232 --> 00:39:50.646
- What are you telling me?

613
00:40:01.163 --> 00:40:06.163
- The Argives' consensusimpels
them to slaughter you


614
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.715
upon the tomb of Peleus' son.

615
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.542
- Sorry, sorry.

616
00:40:18.577 --> 00:40:19.715
- No.

617
00:40:19.749 --> 00:40:23.301
- No, don'tbe sorry, that was great.

618
00:40:23.335 --> 00:40:25.611
Really great, did it feel good?

619
00:40:25.646 --> 00:40:29.542
- Yeah, Greta was doing
all the work though.


620
00:40:29.577 --> 00:40:31.266
Oh my God, you're amazing.

621
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:35.266
- No you, Teresa, it is
unbelievable.


622
00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:37.680
You must always be on stage.

623
00:40:39.301 --> 00:40:41.232
- Sorry but we got to thatlast line

624
00:40:41.266 --> 00:40:45.715
and I heard everything youwere saying

625
00:40:45.749 --> 00:40:48.301
like each word I got

626
00:40:48.335 --> 00:40:51.060
it just like didn't
make sense all together.


627
00:40:52.335 --> 00:40:53.715
- Yes, okay.

628
00:40:53.749 --> 00:40:56.335
Teresa, what happened there
that feeling


629
00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.335
that you had that this
was right, this wasn't.


630
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:00.370
Hold on to that.

631
00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:02.577
- Okay.

632
00:41:02.611 --> 00:41:04.197
- It's good to stop then.

633
00:41:04.232 --> 00:41:06.094
When it doesn't feel good.

634
00:41:06.128 --> 00:41:10.404
- Okay, it just confused mewas all.

635
00:41:14.577 --> 00:41:15.473
- What?

636
00:41:15.508 --> 00:41:17.818
- Your next line.

637
00:41:22.335 --> 00:41:25.404
- Oh, alas, mother, what are
you saying?


638
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.680
Okay.

639
00:41:27.715 --> 00:41:28.749
- Get back here

640
00:41:28.784 --> 00:41:30.070
we're not done yet.
- What for? What for?


641
00:41:30.094 --> 00:41:32.060
- What makes you think
you get to decide this?


642
00:41:32.094 --> 00:41:33.094
- The law!

643
00:41:33.128 --> 00:41:35.163
- It's not about the law, it's
your life.


644
00:41:35.197 --> 00:41:36.508
- Yes, my life!

645
00:41:36.542 --> 00:41:37.784
- We get it, she left you.

646
00:41:37.818 --> 00:41:38.887
She fucked up your life,

647
00:41:38.922 --> 00:41:40.070
so now you're going to
fuck it up even more!


648
00:41:40.094 --> 00:41:41.060
That'll show her.

649
00:41:41.094 --> 00:41:41.818
- This isn't about her!

650
00:41:41.853 --> 00:41:42.611
- Of course it's about her!

651
00:41:42.646 --> 00:41:43.542
Get over it.

652
00:41:43.577 --> 00:41:44.404
- Jason.
- She wanted more,


653
00:41:44.439 --> 00:41:45.266
but she was beneath you!

654
00:41:45.301 --> 00:41:46.128
- What the fuck does

655
00:41:46.163 --> 00:41:47.060
that even mean?
- Get over it.


656
00:41:47.094 --> 00:41:48.242
- This is me getting over it!

657
00:41:48.266 --> 00:41:50.060
This is what I want to do!

658
00:41:50.094 --> 00:41:50.749

659
00:41:50.784 --> 00:41:51.611
you want this week.

660
00:41:51.646 --> 00:41:53.060
- Why do you care?

661
00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:54.335
Why do you suddenly care?

662
00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.266
Oh I know, because this
might look bad for you.


663
00:41:57.301 --> 00:42:00.094
The great Jason Beck, whathis
kid dropped out of school?


664
00:42:00.128 --> 00:42:00.784
Maybe we won't have him-You

665
00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:01.715
On our TV show.

666
00:42:01.749 --> 00:42:03.266
- Look I don't care what you
think.


667
00:42:03.301 --> 00:42:04.335
- Obviously!

668
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.484

- I know how to run a newspaper!

671
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.611
- Listen to how ridiculous you
sound!


672
00:42:09.646 --> 00:42:10.473
- You only care...

673
00:42:10.508 --> 00:42:11.818
- A newspaper, that's the
future!


674
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.818
- I'm good at it!

675
00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.060
- Of course you are dear.

676
00:42:14.094 --> 00:42:15.301
- How would you know?

677
00:42:15.335 --> 00:42:16.587

Lessons on how to treat mom?

680
00:42:21.094 --> 00:42:21.749
- Get out.

681
00:42:21.784 --> 00:42:22.611
- Jason!

682
00:42:22.646 --> 00:42:23.715
- Don't do anything rash.

683
00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:24.715
- No get out, justbecause
the girl left you.


684
00:42:24.749 --> 00:42:26.473
- Oh no, no, no, no.

685
00:43:14.784 --> 00:43:17.370
- Can I get you anything else?

686
00:46:13.508 --> 00:46:14.818
- Checkford Journal office.

687
00:46:15.715 --> 00:46:17.232
Yeah we're still in business.

688
00:46:17.266 --> 00:46:19.473
That's how come there's a
paper today.


689
00:46:19.508 --> 00:46:21.060
You want an ad or something?

690
00:46:22.439 --> 00:46:23.439
How come?

691
00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.370
You can talk to him in a minute.

692
00:46:27.577 --> 00:46:28.577
You've got what?

693
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.301
How can anyone see that?

694
00:46:33.335 --> 00:46:35.060
No, look on page four,

695
00:46:35.094 --> 00:46:37.060
that's an ad, that's what you
want.


696
00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.060
- I know Jan would be proud.

697
00:46:40.094 --> 00:46:41.128
You did good Max.

698
00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:43.473
Yeah, you could use some more

699
00:46:43.508 --> 00:46:45.163
arts coverage but you did good.

700
00:46:46.715 --> 00:46:49.577
Yeah, next week you
should interview Teresa.


701
00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:51.197
Everyone knows her from thediner

702
00:46:51.232 --> 00:46:53.508
so they'd like to know
this new side of her.


703
00:46:55.163 --> 00:46:57.094
Who have you got doing your adsales?

704
00:46:58.611 --> 00:46:59.611
Can I borrow him?

705
00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:03.646
We're proud of you Max.

706
00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.439
We're lucky to have you doing
this, okay.


707
00:47:06.473 --> 00:47:09.335
- Yes, no, I know, I know.

708
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:10.577
That's what it'll have to be.

709
00:47:10.611 --> 00:47:13.163
But if it's fast enoughwe
can make it look like...


710
00:47:14.163 --> 00:47:15.439
We'll make it a good thing.

711
00:47:16.335 --> 00:47:19.611

00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:42.611

720
00:47:43.715 --> 00:47:45.749
- Yes it worked but just for a
week.


721
00:47:45.784 --> 00:47:46.784
It's the exact same...

722
00:47:46.818 --> 00:47:48.208
- It's the other line now,
it's running.


723
00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:49.197
I don't know where to shut itoff.

724
00:47:49.232 --> 00:47:52.680
- It's right by the, hold on.

725

It's by the, you know theblue
thing which has the...


726
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.060
Just do it!

727
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.404
Both, it's both lines now.

728
00:48:16.439 --> 00:48:19.577
Yes, Frank, I need you to fix
it now.


729
00:48:19.611 --> 00:48:21.715
In a couple hours there'llbe

730
00:48:21.749 --> 00:48:24.335
You know kids, they like
to use the bathroom?


731
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.335
Yes, well, yes tell me what todo.

732
00:48:28.542 --> 00:48:33.128
Yes, the first section
it'scoming up the first section.


733
00:48:33.163 --> 00:48:34.749
And then the other line whichcrosses

734
00:48:34.784 --> 00:48:37.749
where you were working,
it's got the same issue.


735
00:48:38.784 --> 00:48:40.818
Yeah, and what if it doesn't...

736
00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.128
Okay but...

737
00:48:44.266 --> 00:48:46.508
Frank stay by the phone.

738
00:48:46.542 --> 00:48:49.508
Don't you dare not answer the
phone.

I know that it's the new inn

that wants it for a patio.

790
00:52:03.749 --> 00:52:06.542
Going from a place where
artists make things


791
00:52:06.577 --> 00:52:10.128
to where you pay to sit insomeone's yard?

00:52:11.266 --> 00:52:12.266
No thank you.

Well you don't each need to...

794
00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:21.163
Christ, thank you, thank you.

795
00:52:21.197 --> 00:52:24.232
Goodbye, come see a play.

796
00:52:24.266 --> 00:52:25.301
- It's still running.

797
00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.508
- Oh right, here's what we
need to do.


798
00:53:13.163 --> 00:53:17.749
- What would Hecuba do
ifPolydorus did not also die?


799
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.508
- What would she do?

800
00:53:19.542 --> 00:53:22.060
- Yes, her daughter dies

801
00:53:22.094 --> 00:53:23.818
then she learns that her son
is dead.


802
00:53:27.577 --> 00:53:31.060
With her son she can
takerevenge on Polymestor.


803
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.060
It feels easy.

804
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.060
- What do you mean?

805
00:53:37.094 --> 00:53:38.646
- Well it feels easier in the
end.


806
00:53:39.646 --> 00:53:41.646
- It feels easier if
both her children die?


807
00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.197
- No, it's easier to know whatto do.

808
00:53:46.232 --> 00:53:49.301
My son is dead, 
Polymester didit.

809
00:53:49.335 --> 00:53:51.060
Here he is, okay.

810
00:53:52.335 --> 00:53:56.611
But what would she do
if it is just Polyxena?


811
00:53:56.646 --> 00:53:59.749
If it is only her
daughterwho is sacrificed.


812
00:54:01.335 --> 00:54:03.060
She has her grief.

813
00:54:04.473 --> 00:54:06.370
But no action.

814
00:54:06.404 --> 00:54:08.577
- What's the action you...

815
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:10.128
- No revenge.

816
00:54:11.163 --> 00:54:13.094
- What's wrong with that?

817
00:54:13.128 --> 00:54:15.301
- She gets so angry when her son

818
00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:19.094
is killed and wants revengebut
not for her daughter.


819
00:54:19.128 --> 00:54:20.749
That is what is wrong.

820
00:54:20.784 --> 00:54:23.094
No? It doesn't feel right.

821
00:54:24.439 --> 00:54:25.784
- Don't think so little of her.

822
00:54:25.818 --> 00:54:28.680
- No, I am going to think
little of her?


823
00:54:28.715 --> 00:54:30.818
No Dorothea, I have to play her.

824
00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.473
I cannot think little of her.

825
00:54:33.508 --> 00:54:35.266
But I have to understand.

826
00:54:35.301 --> 00:54:37.715
That is okay, to understand?

827
00:54:37.749 --> 00:54:39.301
- What do you wanna understand?

828
00:54:39.335 --> 00:54:40.404
- The play.

829
00:54:44.197 --> 00:54:48.060
If I learn that my daughter is
killed


830
00:54:48.094 --> 00:54:49.680
but no news about my son,

831
00:54:52.232 --> 00:54:53.508
what would I do?

832
00:54:53.542 --> 00:54:55.094
Kill myself?

833
00:54:55.128 --> 00:54:56.370
Take revenge?

834
00:54:57.508 --> 00:54:58.335
She doesn't seem to...

835
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.542
- Who would she take revenge on?

836
00:55:02.197 --> 00:55:05.232
- Who? Odysseus.

837
00:55:05.266 --> 00:55:07.542
She saves his life before.

838
00:55:07.577 --> 00:55:10.715
And he does nothing for her
now, nothing!


839
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:14.301
First, revenge.

840
00:55:15.335 --> 00:55:17.715
Then the Greeks.

841
00:55:17.749 --> 00:55:19.577
- Revenge on the Greeks?

842
00:55:19.611 --> 00:55:21.060
- Theseus' sons.

843
00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:26.335
They are the ones first to
talk to sacrifice Polyxena.


844
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:27.715
They are the leaders.

845
00:55:27.749 --> 00:55:29.232
Theseus' sons, why not?

846
00:55:29.266 --> 00:55:30.749
You don't get mad at them?

847
00:55:30.784 --> 00:55:32.542
- Yeah I get mad.

848
00:55:32.577 --> 00:55:34.266
- Well then, why no revenge?

849
00:55:38.646 --> 00:55:40.301
- She has the line about Helen.

850
00:55:41.232 --> 00:55:43.094
- What line about Helen?

851
00:55:43.128 --> 00:55:44.542
- Revenge on Helen.

852
00:55:44.577 --> 00:55:45.577
- What?

853
00:55:47.197 --> 00:55:50.060
- Line five, 458.

854
00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:59.439
- Come on.

855
00:55:59.473 --> 00:56:01.439
This is not revenge.

856
00:56:01.473 --> 00:56:05.542
She says screw Helen for
what she did to Troy.


857
00:56:05.577 --> 00:56:08.266
Her eyes, what her eyes did toTroy.

858
00:56:08.301 --> 00:56:10.715
She is not going to take
revenge on Helen.


859
00:56:10.749 --> 00:56:11.749
- Okay.

860
00:56:16.508 --> 00:56:18.335
- This doesn't bother you?

861
00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:20.508
- It does now.

862
00:56:20.542 --> 00:56:23.163
Of course it bothers me if
Hecuba


863
00:56:23.197 --> 00:56:25.335
cares more about her son thanher daughter

864
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:28.611
or if her revenge is easy.

865
00:56:28.646 --> 00:56:31.508
- Well, her revenge doesn't have

866
00:56:31.542 --> 00:56:34.577
to be easy but Sir Walter...

867
00:56:34.611 --> 00:56:36.128
- I know, I know.

868
00:56:37.715 --> 00:56:39.060
God, I love these lines.

869
00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:41.577
Oh poor me.

870
00:56:41.611 --> 00:56:43.818
Don't tell me it'sCassandra
you're carrying.


871
00:56:44.715 --> 00:56:47.370
The prophet, the baccante.

872
00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:48.680
- You love those lines?

873
00:56:48.715 --> 00:56:49.784
- Yeah, the rhythm.

874
00:56:50.749 --> 00:56:52.749
Oh poor me, don't tell me it's
Cassandra


875
00:56:52.784 --> 00:56:55.163
you're carrying, the
prophet, the baccante.


876
00:56:57.404 --> 00:57:00.232
Elsa really, really nailed this.

877
00:57:06.404 --> 00:57:09.404
Maybe it's the hope.

878
00:57:11.197 --> 00:57:15.611
Polydorus was safe, free
with money and allies.


879
00:57:16.508 --> 00:57:18.163
He was hope.

880
00:57:19.128 --> 00:57:22.301
Suddenly he's dead, the
lasthope for the family is dead.


881
00:57:24.784 --> 00:57:28.197
You're most desperate
when there's no hope.


882
00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.301
Maybe?

883
00:57:33.335 --> 00:57:34.335
- Maybe.

884
00:57:36.128 --> 00:57:37.128
- To be continued?

885
00:57:38.542 --> 00:57:39.542
- Maybe.

886
00:58:30.749 --> 00:58:31.784
- I screwed up.

887
00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:34.646
- How is that?

888
00:58:37.439 --> 00:58:38.784
- Ray lost his job.

889
00:58:41.197 --> 00:58:43.301
I didn't mean for him to lose
his job.


890
00:58:43.335 --> 00:58:44.577
- You wrote an article only.

891
00:58:44.611 --> 00:58:46.508
- Yeah but I should have
known, right?


892
00:58:49.266 --> 00:58:53.163
You see, it's basic politics.

893
00:58:53.197 --> 00:58:54.266
I should have known.

894
00:58:54.301 --> 00:58:57.749
- Max, there is a vast
history to the world.


895
00:58:57.784 --> 00:59:00.197
- Yeah, but this was basic.

896
00:59:02.577 --> 00:59:04.577
I should have known, or lookedit up.

897
00:59:09.197 --> 00:59:10.197
I screwed up.

898
00:59:12.404 --> 00:59:14.301
- You screwed up!

899
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.818
Someone yelled that atme
once when I was young.


900
00:59:23.094 --> 00:59:24.577
Someone I idolized.

901
00:59:26.577 --> 00:59:31.577
That moment it is indented
in my spine, it hurt.


902
00:59:32.094 --> 00:59:34.266
But it was what I needed.

903
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:39.611
And I was always amazed how heknew this.

904
00:59:41.197 --> 00:59:46.197
Just as I am amazed how you
canplay this role for yourself.


905
00:59:47.508 --> 00:59:49.818
That you can yell to correctyourself.

906
00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:58.094
Now Max, you wrote avery
interesting profile.


907
00:59:58.128 --> 01:00:00.749
I learned a great dealabout
May and Ray from it.


908
01:00:01.818 --> 01:00:04.439
More than the many articlesthat
others have written.


909
01:00:04.473 --> 01:00:07.439
How was it I never knewthat
she was from Alabama?


910
01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:09.818
And he was from Australia?

911
01:00:11.128 --> 01:00:12.784
This is valid information

912
01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:15.473
for a pair that traffics in
identity.


913
01:00:19.232 --> 01:00:23.232
Now you wrote that Ray'smother
was Taiwanese, yes?


914
01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:29.439
If you were more familiar
with the politics


915
01:00:29.473 --> 01:00:33.094
between China and Taiwan
you might have foreseen


916
01:00:33.128 --> 01:00:35.266
that this could cause himproblems.

917
01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:38.473
So in one sense, you screwed up.

918
01:00:39.749 --> 01:00:42.473
But in another you did not.

919
01:00:44.404 --> 01:00:45.818
You have learned your lesson.

920
01:00:46.818 --> 01:00:47.818
You'll move on.

921
01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:55.128
- Jan wouldn't have made this
mistake.


922
01:00:59.611 --> 01:01:00.784
Why did she leave?

923
01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.473
I don't know what I'm doing.

924
01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:12.611
- Max, if I may, 
I have an idea.

925
01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.818
A theory why Jan left.

926
01:01:16.784 --> 01:01:17.784
It's just a theory.

927
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680
- Yeah, okay.

928
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.473
- It starts with a story.

929
01:01:28.266 --> 01:01:29.587
- Going to tell us a story,
are you?


930
01:01:29.611 --> 01:01:30.749
- If I may.

931
01:01:30.784 --> 01:01:33.266
- Right on, make it count.

932
01:01:34.335 --> 01:01:37.060
- Once there was a young
British couple


933
01:01:38.301 --> 01:01:40.335
traveling through the south of France.

934
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.577
- Oh, I like this.

935
01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:47.128
- They were on their way toltaly
when their car broke down.


936
01:01:48.818 --> 01:01:52.335
Now, to the young, this is no
tragedy.


937
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.749
They had only vague aims andno agenda.

938
01:01:56.646 --> 01:02:00.370
Harold, the young man,
was on his way to Italy


939
01:02:00.404 --> 01:02:02.404
to study with the great
architects.


940
01:02:03.508 --> 01:02:07.060
The woman, Susan, took
portraits.


941
01:02:09.404 --> 01:02:11.577
Now, while their car was beingrepaired

942
01:02:11.611 --> 01:02:14.232
they decided to explore theplace

943
01:02:14.266 --> 01:02:16.749
that they had so nearly flownby.

944
01:02:18.094 --> 01:02:20.611
They were young and curious.

945
01:02:20.646 --> 01:02:22.301
They made friends easily.

946
01:02:24.473 --> 01:02:25.818
And one young friend,

947
01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:31.094
Claire she took them up to the
mountains.


948
01:02:32.232 --> 01:02:36.508
She knew a young man, Pierrewho
ran a restaurant there.


949
01:02:37.818 --> 01:02:40.473
The restaurant was soon toclose.

950
01:02:40.508 --> 01:02:43.128
And she wanted to eat thereone last time.

951
01:02:45.818 --> 01:02:50.163
Harold and Susan how theyloved that food.

952
01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.060
You see, mountain food isunique.

953
01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:00.060
Yes, every pile of earthhas
its own point of view.


954
01:03:01.508 --> 01:03:05.232
Every piece invents its own

955
01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:07.818
roots and leaves.

956
01:03:10.715 --> 01:03:13.577
Well that afternoon, it
changed Harold.


957
01:03:13.611 --> 01:03:15.335
All these tastes.

958
01:03:16.335 --> 01:03:18.473
He was so full of questions.

959
01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.680
And Pierre answered them
all, but it took months.


960
01:03:23.715 --> 01:03:26.508
But at the end it became clear

961
01:03:26.542 --> 01:03:29.784
that the restaurant should notclose

962
01:03:29.818 --> 01:03:33.577
but should pass to Harold, andso it did.

963
01:03:35.301 --> 01:03:37.784
And he did marvelous thingswith it.

964
01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.404
For 20 years.

965
01:03:43.577 --> 01:03:46.232
Now when Harold died, it was
unclear


966
01:03:46.266 --> 01:03:48.439
what should become of therestaurant.

967
01:03:50.232 --> 01:03:54.646
Susan kept it open whileshe
searched for a new chef.


968
01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:59.232
The search was long and
difficult


969
01:03:59.266 --> 01:04:03.680
but in the end it
revealedthe perfect person


970
01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:05.646
to run the place.

971
01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.680
It turned out to be Susan
herself.


972
01:04:08.784 --> 01:04:12.749
And so for the next 20
years she ran the place.


973
01:04:15.784 --> 01:04:19.473
She even achieved a certainnational fame.

974
01:04:20.715 --> 01:04:23.128
If one can be famous up in themountains.

975
01:04:26.473 --> 01:04:29.439
Now Susan, she thought ahead.

976
01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:33.439
She could have continued
working,


977
01:04:33.473 --> 01:04:36.301
but she knew that with everyyear

978
01:04:36.335 --> 01:04:38.266
there were fewer young people

979
01:04:38.301 --> 01:04:40.508
who were interested in thiskind of work.

980
01:04:41.542 --> 01:04:46.301
So at the height of
the restaurant's renown


981
01:04:46.335 --> 01:04:48.473
she searched for her
replacement.


982
01:04:50.749 --> 01:04:54.128
When she found him,

983
01:04:54.163 --> 01:04:59.060
a young man, not an obvious
candidate to the others


984
01:04:59.094 --> 01:05:03.266
but she saw something in him.

985
01:05:06.128 --> 01:05:10.577
She found him, and she
left, she disappeared.


986
01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:12.818
She loved the place, but sheleft.

987
01:05:14.232 --> 01:05:16.784
She knew that if she stayed

988
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.715
she would cast a long shadow.

989
01:05:21.715 --> 01:05:24.266
She knew the best gift shecould give

990
01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:28.439
this new young chef was anempty kitchen.

991
01:05:30.439 --> 01:05:33.060
The work would teach him allthe rest.

992
01:05:37.715 --> 01:05:40.232
- Your stories always make mehungry.

993
01:05:41.266 --> 01:05:44.542
- Now Max, I have watched you.

994
01:05:44.577 --> 01:05:49.163
I have seen how you
have avoided Jan's desk.


995
01:05:50.094 --> 01:05:52.508
Even now as you sitthere
you avoid the place


996
01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:54.473
where her typewriter was.

997
01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:59.197
Now, it is possible she
took this typewriter


998
01:05:59.232 --> 01:06:02.060
because, it is true that writers

999
01:06:02.094 --> 01:06:05.197
have a close connection
with these machines.


1000
01:06:06.646 --> 01:06:11.646
But it is also possible thatshe took it

1001
01:06:11.715 --> 01:06:13.508
to make room for you.

1002
01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:19.577
That she left you an empty
kitchen.


1003
01:06:24.163 --> 01:06:26.818
She saw something in you.

1004
01:06:29.439 --> 01:06:32.060
And I now see she couldn't

1005
01:06:32.094 --> 01:06:34.060
possibly have chosen better.

1006
01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:38.542
- Here, here!

1007
01:06:39.404 --> 01:06:41.163
Here's to the chosen

1008
01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:45.060
and capable young Max.

1009
01:06:51.301 --> 01:06:53.784
To young Max!

1010
01:06:57.818 --> 01:06:58.818
- Thank you, Sam.

1011
01:06:59.060 --> 01:06:59.680
- Sure.

1012
01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:00.542
- And how are...

1013
01:07:00.577 --> 01:07:02.335
- Sorry, Greta, just a sec.

1014
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:11.508
- Be right back, Sam.

1015
01:07:15.266 --> 01:07:18.232
- Hello, Simon, sorry,
I don't mean to disturb you.


1016
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:31.853

1019

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:17.370
- Hey, Max.

1028
01:08:17.404 --> 01:08:18.232
- I can't believe it.

1029
01:08:18.266 --> 01:08:19.094
- Max.

1030
01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:19.818
- He fucking changed the locks.

1031
01:08:19.853 --> 01:08:21.439
- Max, he didn't mean to.

1032
01:08:21.473 --> 01:08:23.542
- How do you not mean to
change the locks?


1033
01:08:26.163 --> 01:08:27.232
- He's not here is he?

1034
01:08:28.128 --> 01:08:31.094
- No.

1035
01:08:31.128 --> 01:08:32.542
Max, I told you he wouldn't be.

1036
01:08:33.473 --> 01:08:35.128
- He's probably on some TV show.

1037
01:08:38.335 --> 01:08:39.818
He is, isn't he?

1038
01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:43.404
- Your father is very good on
TV.


1039
01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:45.611
- Yeah, of course he is.

1040
01:08:45.646 --> 01:08:47.508
He knows it all, he's perfect
for TV.


1041
01:08:50.577 --> 01:08:51.404
I'll get my things.

1042
01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.577
- Oh but you don't have to.

1043
01:08:53.611 --> 01:08:55.818
Right away, don't you want to
sit a bit?


1044
01:08:59.128 --> 01:09:00.715
You look tired, 
Max, you look...

1045
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:05.232
- I am, I've been working, it's hard.

1046
01:09:09.335 --> 01:09:10.818
- Will you sign it for me?

1047
01:09:12.197 --> 01:09:13.094
- What do you
want me to signit for?

1048
01:09:13.128 --> 01:09:14.473
- Please.

1049
01:09:14.508 --> 01:09:16.404
- Mom, editors don't sign
newspapers.


1050
01:09:18.542 --> 01:09:19.680
- Okay.

1051
01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:21.173
- I got kicked out of the
house for it,


1052
01:09:21.197 --> 01:09:22.277
now you want me to sign it?

1053
01:09:22.301 --> 01:09:25.577
- You don't have to.

1054
01:09:25.611 --> 01:09:28.335
That's okay, but don't you
want to sit for a while?


1055
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:31.163
He's not gonna be home untillate.

1056
01:09:31.197 --> 01:09:32.060
Dinner's...

1057
01:09:32.094 --> 01:09:33.025
- I can't, mom.

1058
01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.070
- I made spaghetti the way you
like.


1059
01:09:34.094 --> 01:09:35.139
- I can't, mom, I have work.

1060
01:09:35.163 --> 01:09:36.311
- I made it the way you
like, except I put...


1061
01:09:36.335 --> 01:09:38.646
- Do you have any idea
howmuch work I have to do?


1062
01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.508
You can't just sit...

1063
01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.335
- No! Jesus, mom, no, I can't!

1064
01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:42.794
How many times do I have to
tell you?


1065
01:09:42.818 --> 01:09:44.301
No! I can't!

1066
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:50.749
Fine.

1067
01:09:53.404 --> 01:09:54.232
- You'll stay?

1068
01:09:54.266 --> 01:09:56.680
- Yeah, I'll stay, I'll stay.

1069
01:10:16.335 --> 01:10:17.335
- Is it okay?

1070
01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:18.404
- Yeah.

1071
01:10:18.439 --> 01:10:20.542
- Yeah? You like it?

1072
01:10:20.577 --> 01:10:24.060
- Yeah, it's good, tastes good.

1073
01:13:48.473 --> 01:13:52.197
- Ow! Jesus!

1074
01:13:52.232 --> 01:13:53.232
- Ray?

1075
01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.266
- Ow...

1076
01:13:55.301 --> 01:13:56.449
- What the fuck are you doing?

1077
01:13:56.473 --> 01:13:59.680
- I was kidnapping you, it was
awesome.


1078
01:13:59.715 --> 01:14:01.301
- You were what?

1079
01:14:01.335 --> 01:14:02.404
- Kidnapping you.

1080
01:14:03.508 --> 01:14:04.370
- Ray.

1081
01:14:04.404 --> 01:14:05.232
- Yeah?

1082
01:14:05.266 --> 01:14:07.335
- I asked you to meet me here.

1083
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:10.646
- May, a lot of people
know their kidnappers.


1084
01:14:12.232 --> 01:14:14.680
- So what, am I kidnapping younow?

1085
01:14:14.715 --> 01:14:16.749
No, this isn't ridiculous atall.

1086
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.163
You licked me!

1087
01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:23.577
- Mmmh.

1088
01:14:23.611 --> 01:14:25.646
- It's like you're six years
old.


1089
01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.794
- We should do a piece likethis!

1090
01:14:26.818 --> 01:14:27.818
- Lick the kidnapper?

1091
01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:29.611
- Lick the kidnapper, that's
right!


1092
01:14:29.646 --> 01:14:30.656
That's brilliant, we can...

1093
01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.508
- Ray.

1094
01:14:31.542 --> 01:14:33.060
- You know what...

1095
01:14:35.163 --> 01:14:37.335
It's what we're good at, May.

1096
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:38.370
- Yeah.

1097
01:14:40.611 --> 01:14:41.749
- Is it like this with him?

1098
01:14:41.784 --> 01:14:44.404
- No, he is much more mature.

1099
01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.680
It's no fun at all.

1100
01:14:51.646 --> 01:14:53.508
Why'd you do it, May?

1101
01:14:53.542 --> 01:14:54.473
- You told me to!

1102
01:14:54.508 --> 01:14:55.611
- I told you not to!

1103
01:14:55.646 --> 01:14:56.680
- After you told me to!

1104
01:14:56.715 --> 01:14:57.784
After I did it!

1105
01:14:57.818 --> 01:14:59.311
- Well why'd you have to
listen to me in order?


1106
01:14:59.335 --> 01:15:00.301
You should know better.

1107
01:15:00.335 --> 01:15:01.749
- Boy, I really should.

1108
01:15:04.749 --> 01:15:05.577
- No, you should do it.

1109
01:15:05.611 --> 01:15:06.784
- Oh, Jesus.

1110
01:15:06.818 --> 01:15:07.646
- You should.

1111
01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.680
- I did.

1112
01:15:12.128 --> 01:15:13.542
- We worked so hard for it.

1113
01:15:15.542 --> 01:15:16.646
- Yeah.

1114
01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.542
- I don't want it to just
disappear.


1115
01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:22.232
But fuck! The new guy.

1116
01:15:23.784 --> 01:15:26.439
It's so hard seeing you with
the new Ray.


1117
01:15:26.473 --> 01:15:28.060
I bet his name isn't even Ray.

1118
01:15:29.232 --> 01:15:30.680
I bet that's not his real name.

1119
01:15:32.542 --> 01:15:33.749
Fuck, it is!

1120
01:15:34.818 --> 01:15:37.094
You even found a new
Ray who's really a Ray.


1121
01:15:37.128 --> 01:15:41.128
It's so...

1122
01:15:41.163 --> 01:15:42.577
You look so happy together.

1123
01:15:43.473 --> 01:15:45.370
Why do you always look so happy?

1124
01:15:46.611 --> 01:15:49.335
- Why do you always looklike
you're selling clothes?


1125
01:15:51.646 --> 01:15:52.749
It's who we are, babe.

1126
01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.680
People believe me.

1127
01:15:58.646 --> 01:16:01.094
- That's such a fucking
mindfuck!


1128
01:16:01.128 --> 01:16:02.335
- What?

1129
01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:04.439
- I don't know whether
tobelieve anything from you.


1130
01:16:04.473 --> 01:16:06.370
How do I know you're not into
him?


1131
01:16:06.404 --> 01:16:07.508
- I'm not, Ray.

1132
01:16:09.508 --> 01:16:10.508
He's not you.

1133
01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:14.335
- See?

1134
01:16:15.163 --> 01:16:17.439
Mindfuck, how do I know?

1135
01:16:22.197 --> 01:16:24.715
Fine, I believe you.

1136
01:16:27.404 --> 01:16:29.508
How am I not gonna see you
every day, May?


1137
01:16:30.508 --> 01:16:33.646
How come we not work togetherany more?

1138
01:16:36.404 --> 01:16:42.163
- I don't know.

1139
01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:44.439
- The hierarchy of furniture
is cruel.


1140
01:16:46.611 --> 01:16:48.094
- Yes.

1141
01:16:48.128 --> 01:16:52.680
- The suffering of furniture
is real.


1142
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.680
- Yes.

1143
01:17:14.266 --> 01:17:16.715
♪ This is the place

1170
01:19:42.715 --> 01:19:45.680
- I'm sorry, they voted.

1171
01:19:45.715 --> 01:19:48.163
The school board they voted
last night.


1172
01:19:48.197 --> 01:19:50.680
It's a new board, and
I'm not on it anymore.


1173
01:19:50.715 --> 01:19:53.232
I just heard.

1174
01:19:53.266 --> 01:19:55.266
The school arts funding
is going to them now.


1175
01:19:56.197 --> 01:19:57.197
To May Ray.

1176
01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.404
It's the same proposal as before

1177
01:20:01.439 --> 01:20:02.919
so they didn't need the notice
period.


1178
01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:07.508
It's done, I'm sorry.

1179
01:20:12.473 --> 01:20:14.577
And it's not Pat's fault, you
know.


1180
01:20:15.715 --> 01:20:16.760
There was nothing she could'vedone,

1181
01:20:16.784 --> 01:20:19.060
it was all the new people.

1182
01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:27.715
I'm sorry, they kept it reallyquiet.

1183
01:20:27.749 --> 01:20:31.128
I just found out.

1184
01:20:38.232 --> 01:20:39.232
- Yeah.

1185
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.577
- Hold me steady there,
children and help me go out.


1186
01:21:18.611 --> 01:21:20.197
Keep me straight!

1187
01:21:20.232 --> 01:21:21.473
That's the way.

1188
01:21:22.335 --> 01:21:25.439
I'm not young anymore,
dear daughters of Troy.


1189
01:21:25.473 --> 01:21:29.508
I'm a servant like you thoughl
once was your mistress.


1190
01:21:35.473 --> 01:21:38.646
Blazing sunlight of
Zeus, and obsidian night


1191
01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:43.508
when will these phantoms
andnight terrors leave me alone?


1192
01:21:45.335 --> 01:21:50.335
O Holy One Earth below
motherof black-winged dreams


1193
01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:54.508
may the vision I saw in
thenight stay away leave me be!


1194
01:21:56.508 --> 01:21:59.439
There, in my dream, was my child

1195
01:21:59.473 --> 01:22:02.197
whom I sent off to Thrace forsafekeeping.

1196
01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:05.439
There was Polyxena, too.

1197
01:22:05.473 --> 01:22:07.680
My dear daughter appeared in
this vision


1198
01:22:07.715 --> 01:22:09.542
and it shook me with panic.

1199
01:22:11.128 --> 01:22:12.370
Gods of earth down below,

1200
01:22:12.404 --> 01:22:14.266
keep my child safe from harm!

1201
01:22:14.301 --> 01:22:16.197
He alone is my anchor.

1202
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:19.611
A friend of his father
watches over him now,


1203
01:22:19.646 --> 01:22:22.749
here in Thrace, land of snow.

1204
01:22:24.818 --> 01:22:27.094
How I fear what comes next.

1205
01:22:29.163 --> 01:22:31.611
Our refrain will be wailing.

1206
01:22:31.646 --> 01:22:33.473
We're wailing already.

1207
01:22:34.646 --> 01:22:37.680
I'm quailing and trembling
like never before.


1208
01:22:40.128 --> 01:22:43.197
The gods granted Helenus
insight, where is he?


1209
01:22:44.197 --> 01:22:45.577
Where's my Cassandra?

1210
01:22:45.611 --> 01:22:47.818
O daughters of Troy where's
the judge


1211
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:50.473
that can help me decipherthese dreams?

1212
01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:54.680
Here's what I saw in my vision:

1213
01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.680
a dappled deer being slaughtered

1214
01:22:59.577 --> 01:23:02.163
slain by a wolf's bloody claw

1215
01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:07.646
and torn from my knees withoutpity.

1216
01:23:12.301 --> 01:23:15.301
- Mother, why are you shouting?

1217
01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.163
What's next, what's the news?

1218
01:23:18.197 --> 01:23:21.301
You've startled me out of
thehouse like a terrified bird.


1219
01:23:21.335 --> 01:23:23.197
- Alas, my child.

1220
01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:27.370
- What is this unholy prelude
to sorrow?


1221
01:23:27.404 --> 01:23:29.577
- Ah, your life.

1222
01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:32.473
- Speak out!

1223
01:23:34.335 --> 01:23:35.715
Please, conceal it no longer.

1224
01:23:35.749 --> 01:23:39.232
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, mother.

1225
01:23:42.301 --> 01:23:43.301
Why are you weeping?

1226
01:23:46.473 --> 01:23:51.335
- My child, O child of an
unhappy mother.


1227
01:23:54.094 --> 01:23:55.335
- What are you telling me?

1228
01:24:01.094 --> 01:24:04.370
- The Argives' consensus
impels them


1229
01:24:04.404 --> 01:24:08.370
to slaughter you upon
the tomb of Peleus' son.


1230
01:24:10.439 --> 01:24:12.508
- Alas, mother, what are yousaying?

1231
01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:16.197
- Look here comesOdysseus, in quite a rush.

1232
01:24:16.232 --> 01:24:18.404
- He'll tell you, Hecuba,
what will be next.


1233
01:24:22.232 --> 01:24:26.266
- Woman I think you know thearmy's mind

1234
01:24:26.301 --> 01:24:27.680
and what has been decreed.

1235
01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:29.818
Still, I will tell you.

1236
01:24:32.128 --> 01:24:35.335
The Achaeans have resolved
to sacrifice Polyxena,


1237
01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.818
your daughter at the site

1238
01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:39.818
of Achilles' lofty burialmound and grave.

1239
01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:44.060
They designated me to be
herconvoy and to escort her there.


1240
01:24:44.094 --> 01:24:45.370
The appointed priest presiding

1241
01:24:45.404 --> 01:24:48.542
at the sacrificial rite
will be Achilles' son.


1242
01:24:50.404 --> 01:24:53.680
You are aware of how you
must conduct yourself.


1243
01:24:56.094 --> 01:25:00.094
Don't think your hands' andarms' strength

1244
01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:01.404
can contend with mine.

1245
01:25:02.439 --> 01:25:06.508
Don't make me have to
drag you off by force.


1246
01:25:07.646 --> 01:25:10.646
Recognize where your safetylies.

1247
01:25:11.749 --> 01:25:13.542
Acknowledge your present
troubles.


1248
01:25:14.715 --> 01:25:16.542
The better part of wisdom

1249
01:25:16.577 --> 01:25:20.197
is to keep your thoughtsin
line even in troubles.


1250
01:25:23.508 --> 01:25:24.784
- If it's allowed for servants

1251
01:25:24.818 --> 01:25:27.128
to ask questions that cause no
pain,


1252
01:25:27.163 --> 01:25:29.128
and do not sting the heart.

1253
01:25:29.163 --> 01:25:31.646
- It is allowed, ask,
I don't begrudge the time.


1254
01:25:32.611 --> 01:25:36.163
- You know when
you came tollion a spy,

1255
01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:38.646
disguised in shabby clothes

1256
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.542
with drops of blood trickling

1257
01:25:40.577 --> 01:25:42.508
from your eyes down to your jaw?

1258
01:25:42.542 --> 01:25:44.577
- Yes, I know, it touched myinmost heart.

1259
01:25:44.611 --> 01:25:46.680
- And Helen knew you, and toldonly me?

1260
01:25:46.715 --> 01:25:49.060
- I remember, I was in greatdanger.

1261
01:25:49.094 --> 01:25:51.508
- You were humbled and
took hold of my knees?


1262
01:25:51.542 --> 01:25:54.163
- I gripped your robe so
hard my hand went dead.


1263
01:25:54.197 --> 01:25:57.266
- Well, then, I saved you,
and sent you from our land?


1264
01:25:57.301 --> 01:25:59.611
- Because of that,
I liveto see this daylight.


1265
01:25:59.646 --> 01:26:02.680
- What did you tell me,
then, when you were my slave?


1266
01:26:02.715 --> 01:26:05.715
- The words came easily,
I didn't want to die.


1267
01:26:05.749 --> 01:26:08.715
- Well, aren't you ashamed,
then, of these counsels?


1268
01:26:08.749 --> 01:26:12.094
You whom I treated just as youdescribe

1269
01:26:12.128 --> 01:26:15.301
and now instead of showing anykindness

1270
01:26:15.335 --> 01:26:17.542
intend to do us all the harmyou can?

1271
01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:19.749
You're an ungracious breed,

1272
01:26:19.784 --> 01:26:23.163
you demagogues lusting foracclaim.

1273
01:26:23.197 --> 01:26:24.611
You don't care if you hurt afriend

1274
01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:28.197
or a loved one if your
wordsfind favor with the masses.


1275
01:26:28.232 --> 01:26:31.163
Tell me, now, were you
compelled to slaughter


1276
01:26:31.197 --> 01:26:34.439
a human victim at a tomb
where cattle sacrifice


1277
01:26:34.473 --> 01:26:35.646
would be more proper?

1278
01:26:36.577 --> 01:26:39.577
Perhaps Achilles wants his
just revenge,


1279
01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:42.439
murder, to strike back atmurderers.

1280
01:26:42.473 --> 01:26:45.197
But this girl hasn't done himany harm!

1281
01:26:46.197 --> 01:26:50.508
You once fell at my feet
and took hold of my hand


1282
01:26:50.542 --> 01:26:53.094
and touched the cheek of thisold woman.

1283
01:26:54.646 --> 01:26:57.335
Now I am touching yours.

1284
01:26:57.370 --> 01:26:59.508
I am your suppliant.

1285
01:26:59.542 --> 01:27:02.060
I am begging for repayment.

1286
01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.094
Please, be gracious.

1287
01:27:05.128 --> 01:27:08.060
Please, don't drag my child
from my arms.


1288
01:27:09.232 --> 01:27:10.473
Don't kill her.

1289
01:27:11.611 --> 01:27:14.439
Enough have died already.

1290
01:27:17.784 --> 01:27:21.818
She's my escape from sorrows.

1291
01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:27.060
My delight, my coolness,
my relief from many things.


1292
01:27:27.404 --> 01:27:31.060
My city, my nurse,

1293
01:27:31.094 --> 01:27:32.715
my staff, my guide.

1294
01:27:37.611 --> 01:27:40.163
Those with power shouldstay
within their limits.


1295
01:27:41.818 --> 01:27:43.163
The fortunate should realize

1296
01:27:43.197 --> 01:27:45.128
their joy may not go on forever.

1297
01:27:45.163 --> 01:27:48.680
Look at me, I'm not what I
once was.


1298
01:27:48.715 --> 01:27:52.439
A single day divested me
of all the wealth I had.


1299
01:27:55.784 --> 01:28:00.784
I beg you by your beard
show reverence and pity.


1300
01:28:02.508 --> 01:28:06.542
Go to the Achaean army
and change their minds.


1301
01:28:06.577 --> 01:28:10.232
Tell them killing women
will stir up grudges.


1302
01:28:10.266 --> 01:28:12.060
When you had the chance,

1303
01:28:12.094 --> 01:28:14.060
when you dragged them from the
altars,


1304
01:28:14.094 --> 01:28:15.611
you didn't kill them.

1305
01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.749
You had pity.

1306
01:28:21.266 --> 01:28:23.508
Tell them Greek law regarding
bloodshed


1307
01:28:23.542 --> 01:28:26.404
is the same for free men andfor slaves.

1308
01:28:26.439 --> 01:28:28.232
- I am prepared to save your life

1309
01:28:28.266 --> 01:28:30.060
and I stand by my statement.

1310
01:28:37.473 --> 01:28:40.818
You treated me kindly, 
I wasfortunate.

1311
01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.620
But I will not take back theproposition

1312
01:28:42.646 --> 01:28:44.473
I made to the assembly.

1313
01:28:44.508 --> 01:28:46.163
Now that Troy is taken we
should offer


1314
01:28:46.197 --> 01:28:47.680
to the army's greatest man

1315
01:28:47.715 --> 01:28:51.163
the sacrifice he asks for, your child.

1316
01:28:53.577 --> 01:28:57.335
So many cities are undone bythis mistake.

1317
01:28:57.370 --> 01:28:59.749
The noble man, the eager
benefactor


1318
01:28:59.784 --> 01:29:02.508
gets no more reward than
lesser men.


1319
01:29:02.542 --> 01:29:06.577
Achilles is deserving
of every honor, woman.


1320
01:29:06.611 --> 01:29:09.266
He has died a mostglorious
death for Hellas.


1321
01:29:10.197 --> 01:29:11.266
For his country.

1322
01:29:15.197 --> 01:29:18.749
Well, isn't it shameful
to treat him as a friend


1323
01:29:18.784 --> 01:29:21.611
while he's alive but not
when he has perished?


1324
01:29:21.646 --> 01:29:22.725
What, then, will people say

1325
01:29:22.749 --> 01:29:25.060
if there's another marshalingof troops,

1326
01:29:25.094 --> 01:29:27.542
another contest against theenemy?

1327
01:29:27.577 --> 01:29:29.232
Will we fight then?

1328
01:29:29.266 --> 01:29:31.404
Or will we simply be in
love with our survival


1329
01:29:31.439 --> 01:29:34.473
since as we've seen the
dead receive no honor?


1330
01:29:36.611 --> 01:29:38.508
And as for all your pitifulsuffering,

1331
01:29:39.715 --> 01:29:40.715
I heard you out.

1332
01:29:41.818 --> 01:29:43.060
Now you listen to me.

1333
01:29:44.784 --> 01:29:47.749
We have old women whose sheer
wretchedness


1334
01:29:47.784 --> 01:29:50.060
outweighs yours and old men too,

1335
01:29:50.094 --> 01:29:53.370
and brides whose husbands,
excellent young men,


1336
01:29:53.404 --> 01:29:56.818
lie dead here, the dust
oflda covering their bodies.


1337
01:29:58.094 --> 01:30:01.232
You must endure what happens.

1338
01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:06.508
Our Greek custom of honoringthe noble

1339
01:30:06.542 --> 01:30:09.439
may well strike you as idiotic.

1340
01:30:09.473 --> 01:30:12.232
All right, then, we're fools.

1341
01:30:13.301 --> 01:30:15.611
You barbarians go right on ahead

1342
01:30:15.646 --> 01:30:17.818
not treating friends as friends.

1343
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.646
Not valuing those who die withglory.

1344
01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.715
Greece will have good fortune

1345
01:30:23.749 --> 01:30:26.060
and your fates will match yourcounsels.

1346
01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:32.232
- Ah, slavery is an evil.

1347
01:30:33.197 --> 01:30:35.163
Defeated by violence slavesendure

1348
01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:36.784
what they should never have to.

1349
01:30:36.818 --> 01:30:39.577
- My words are wasted,

1350
01:30:39.611 --> 01:30:42.473
flung up to the sky and gone.

1351
01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:49.060
My child I cannot prevent your
murder.


1352
01:30:49.197 --> 01:30:52.060
But you if you have more
strength


1353
01:30:52.094 --> 01:30:54.060
than your mother go on,

1354
01:30:54.094 --> 01:30:57.370
and like a nightingale
pour your voice out,


1355
01:30:57.404 --> 01:30:59.715
every note, to save your life.

1356
01:30:59.749 --> 01:31:02.508
Throw yourself pitifully atOdysseus' knee

1357
01:31:02.542 --> 01:31:04.577
and make your appeal on thesecounts:

1358
01:31:04.611 --> 01:31:06.232
he himself has children.

1359
01:31:06.266 --> 01:31:09.060
He may pity your hard fortune.

1360
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:20.370
- Odysseus I see that you are
hiding.


1361
01:31:20.404 --> 01:31:22.128
You're off the hook, don'tworry.

1362
01:31:23.232 --> 01:31:27.163
I refuse to call on Zeus,
protector of the suppliants.


1363
01:31:28.715 --> 01:31:32.818
Since I'm compelled I'll
follow you


1364
01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.197
and also since death is what I want.

1365
01:31:39.749 --> 01:31:43.163
If I resist I'll be no good,

1366
01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:45.060
in love with mere survival.

1367
01:31:46.818 --> 01:31:48.197
Why should I live?

1368
01:31:49.439 --> 01:31:51.542
My father was the lord
of all the Phrygians.


1369
01:31:51.577 --> 01:31:54.128
That was my starting point.

1370
01:31:54.163 --> 01:31:56.335
Then, I was raised on promises

1371
01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:58.404
and hopes of royal marriage,

1372
01:31:58.439 --> 01:32:02.370
and keen rivalries to seewhose
hearth I would belong to.


1373
01:32:05.128 --> 01:32:06.128
Unlucky me.

1374
01:32:08.542 --> 01:32:10.749
I was the princess once.

1375
01:32:12.301 --> 01:32:15.439
First among the women of Ida.

1376
01:32:15.473 --> 01:32:17.508
Admired among the maidens,

1377
01:32:17.542 --> 01:32:20.232
equal to the gods

1378
01:32:20.266 --> 01:32:24.680
in all but one respect,
mortality.


1379
01:32:27.818 --> 01:32:32.060
And now I am a slave.

1380
01:32:33.335 --> 01:32:35.611
The name, to start with-so
unfamiliar


1381
01:32:35.646 --> 01:32:38.163
makes me long for death.

1382
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.197
And then I might get
cruel-minded masters


1383
01:32:42.232 --> 01:32:45.232
whoever pays for me with silver.

1384
01:32:45.266 --> 01:32:49.301
Me, sister of Hector, and of many others!

1385
01:32:49.335 --> 01:32:51.232
Will give me orders?

1386
01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:55.370
Tell me that I must make
thebread and sweep the house,


1387
01:32:55.404 --> 01:33:00.404
and do my weaving spendingpainful
days under compulsion.


1388
01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:03.749
Some paid-for slave
fromsomewhere will defile my bed


1389
01:33:03.784 --> 01:33:06.060
which was considered
prestigious once


1390
01:33:06.094 --> 01:33:08.197
and a prize for rulers.

1391
01:33:11.370 --> 01:33:15.680
No. I am free

1392
01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:17.197
to close my eyes forever,

1393
01:33:18.266 --> 01:33:21.749
turn away from this day'slight
give my body to Hades.


1394
01:33:21.784 --> 01:33:26.060
Go ahead, Odysseus lead me
away now


1395
01:33:26.094 --> 01:33:27.060
and destroy me.

1396
01:33:27.094 --> 01:33:29.508
I have no hope of any future
joy.


1397
01:33:29.542 --> 01:33:31.508
And mother, please don't sayor do a thing

1398
01:33:31.542 --> 01:33:32.680
to try to stop me.

1399
01:33:32.715 --> 01:33:34.163
You should want, as much as I
do,


1400
01:33:34.197 --> 01:33:35.680
for me to die before
submitting myself


1401
01:33:35.715 --> 01:33:38.473
to shameful humiliation farbeneath

1402
01:33:38.508 --> 01:33:40.646
our family's level of
distinction.


1403
01:33:44.232 --> 01:33:45.818
- Nobility is clearly stamped.

1404
01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:48.266
- The sign is wondrous andimpressive.

1405
01:33:48.301 --> 01:33:50.197
- All the more so for
those who prove they're


1406
01:33:50.232 --> 01:33:52.232
worthy of distinction.
- I will not let go


1407
01:33:52.266 --> 01:33:53.266
of this child.

1408
01:33:53.301 --> 01:33:54.861
- Nor will I go away and leave
her here.


1409
01:33:55.784 --> 01:33:58.094
- Mother, listen to me.

1410
01:33:58.128 --> 01:34:02.060
And you, son of Laertes
ease up on her a little.


1411
01:34:02.094 --> 01:34:04.439
It's natural for her to fumewith rage.

1412
01:34:10.163 --> 01:34:11.508
Oh, mother, poor thing.

1413
01:34:14.611 --> 01:34:16.542
Don't fight this battle.

1414
01:34:17.715 --> 01:34:19.197
They're the ones in power.

1415
01:34:20.611 --> 01:34:24.060
Do you want to fall to
theground cast down by force?


1416
01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.060
They'll lacerate your ancient
skin,


1417
01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:28.266
you'll lose your dignity.

1418
01:34:29.542 --> 01:34:32.577
Some youthful arm willgrab
you and drag you off,


1419
01:34:32.611 --> 01:34:34.439
you'll suffer all these things.

1420
01:34:40.611 --> 01:34:42.611
O my dearest, give me your
sweet hand.


1421
01:34:47.749 --> 01:34:50.232
Place your cheek against
my cheek for after this,


1422
01:34:50.266 --> 01:34:53.335
I never will again see the sun's

1423
01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:56.577
great blaze or see its light.

1424
01:35:07.715 --> 01:35:10.094
These are the final
words I'll speak to you.


1425
01:35:23.611 --> 01:35:24.784
I'm going now, mother.

1426
01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:29.163
I'm going down below.

1427
01:35:38.335 --> 01:35:42.473
♪ Breeze

1428
01:35:42.508 --> 01:35:47.508
♪ Ocean breeze

1429
01:35:48.404 --> 01:35:53.404
♪ You spirit the oceangoing

1430
01:35:53.542 --> 01:35:58.542
♪ Barks away

1431
01:35:58.749 --> 01:36:03.749
♪ Far over the deep sea waves

1432
01:36:05.266 --> 01:36:08.266
♪ Now where will you lead

1433
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:12.508
♪ Unhappy me

1434
01:36:15.508 --> 01:36:19.128
- Poor woman enduring more
than I can say.


1435
01:36:19.163 --> 01:36:21.646
- You exist no longer,
though you see the daylight.


1436
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.749
- You have no city.

1437
01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:25.094
- No husband.

1438
01:36:25.128 --> 01:36:26.232
- No child.

1439
01:36:26.266 --> 01:36:27.370
- You're crushed.

1440
01:36:28.266 --> 01:36:29.646
- You've told me nothing new.

1441
01:36:31.784 --> 01:36:34.060
Don't throw these words in my
face.


1442
01:36:35.439 --> 01:36:38.715
I know already.

1443
01:36:38.749 --> 01:36:42.473
Tell me now, why are
youbringing me Polyxena's body?


1444
01:36:43.577 --> 01:36:47.301
I hear every Achaean hand
is busy with her burial.


1445
01:36:47.335 --> 01:36:51.266
- She doesn't know shehasn't
grasped this new pain.


1446
01:36:51.301 --> 01:36:52.404
She laments Polyxena.

1447
01:36:54.404 --> 01:36:55.611
- Oh, poor me.

1448
01:36:56.784 --> 01:36:59.715
Don't tell me it'sCassandra you're carrying

1449
01:36:59.749 --> 01:37:01.266
the prophet, the bacchante!

1450
01:37:01.301 --> 01:37:04.335
- She lives, don't wail for
her sake.


1451
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:06.094
Save your groans for him.

1452
01:37:06.128 --> 01:37:07.784
- This is the one who died.

1453
01:37:07.818 --> 01:37:08.818
Look, now.

1454
01:37:13.749 --> 01:37:18.680
- Alas, I see Polydorus,

1455
01:37:18.715 --> 01:37:20.060
he's dead.

1456
01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:26.473
My child, the one the Thracian

1457
01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:29.197

01:40:03.404 --> 01:40:04.404
- What was that about?

1488
01:40:04.439 --> 01:40:06.163
- Pat, her son.

1489
01:40:06.197 --> 01:40:09.060
His boat accident, it was at
sea.


1490
01:40:09.094 --> 01:40:10.680
- Oh God.

1491
01:40:10.715 --> 01:40:13.404
- He died at sea.

1492
01:40:13.439 --> 01:40:16.060
- I didn't even think,
and in the play Polydorus,


1493
01:40:16.094 --> 01:40:17.439
Oh my goodness.

1494
01:40:17.473 --> 01:40:19.060
- Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1495
01:40:21.611 --> 01:40:23.060
Have you seen Dorothea?

1496
01:40:24.646 --> 01:40:28.094
- She, it was a hard night for
her,


1497
01:40:28.128 --> 01:40:29.439
so she couldn't stay.

1498
01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:34.404
- Oh, was she not happy with
tonight?


1499
01:40:34.439 --> 01:40:37.266
- No, no, she's very happywith the play.

1500
01:40:37.301 --> 01:40:38.439
It was some other things.

1501
01:40:38.473 --> 01:40:40.163
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1502
01:40:41.163 --> 01:40:42.749
- And it was hard on her.

1503
01:40:42.784 --> 01:40:45.370
To see this smallaudience on opening night.

1504
01:40:46.577 --> 01:40:48.508
- I don't understand it.

1505
01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:50.335
I thought there would be more
people.


1506
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:52.680
It was such a hit in the
Renaissance.


1507
01:40:55.094 --> 01:40:56.439
I hope it wasn't me.

1508
01:40:57.542 --> 01:40:59.818
Maybe if you had a more famous
translator.


1509
01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:04.335
- No, we had exactly the righttranslator.

1510
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:06.680
And I know Dorothea she feelsthe same.

1511
01:41:06.715 --> 01:41:09.439
- You were so wonderful tonight.

1512
01:41:10.784 --> 01:41:12.577
I hope more people get to seeyou.

1513
01:41:12.611 --> 01:41:15.060
I know that Max is comingtomorrow.

1514
01:41:15.094 --> 01:41:18.404
I thought Sandra would
have been here tonight.


1515
01:41:18.439 --> 01:41:21.680
- Oh my goodness, you don'tknow.

1516
01:41:21.715 --> 01:41:22.715
- Know what?

1517
01:41:25.508 --> 01:41:28.060
- I'm sorry, Elsa.

1518
01:41:28.094 --> 01:41:31.577
But, Sandra a few days ago,

1519
01:41:31.611 --> 01:41:34.370
she went into the hospital...

1520
01:41:38.508 --> 01:41:41.232
- Oh my God, she...

1521
01:41:46.439 --> 01:41:48.473
- That's right, you weren't at
tech.


1522
01:41:48.508 --> 01:41:50.163
We found out that night.

1523
01:41:52.301 --> 01:41:53.646
- I didn't know.

1524
01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:56.542
- I didn't realize you didn't
know.


1525
01:41:56.577 --> 01:41:57.680
It was just last minute,

1526
01:41:57.715 --> 01:42:02.335
but we made a dedication
to her in the program.


1527
01:42:04.197 --> 01:42:06.611
I'm sorry no one told you, Elsa.

1528
01:42:06.646 --> 01:42:10.060
I hope it is okay with
you, the dedication.


1529
01:42:11.611 --> 01:42:14.611
- Yes, of course, of course.

1530
01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.611
She really won't be here
anymore.


1531
01:42:22.646 --> 01:42:23.749
Her singing...

1532
01:42:25.404 --> 01:42:27.163
She won't be singing anymore.

1533
01:42:27.197 --> 01:42:30.094
- Oh, Elsa, sweetheart.

1534
01:42:32.611 --> 01:42:34.715
- I didn't really know
anything about her.


1535
01:42:35.784 --> 01:42:37.508
Anything about her.

1536
01:42:37.542 --> 01:42:40.335
She was just here and I never...

1537
01:42:41.749 --> 01:42:44.128
She wanted to tell me.

1538
01:42:44.163 --> 01:42:46.335
It would have been so easy
just to listen.


1539
01:42:47.749 --> 01:42:49.611
She had stories.

1540
01:42:49.646 --> 01:42:51.784
- Oh, Elsa, Elsa.

1541
01:42:53.749 --> 01:42:56.715
That is not the thing to think
about.


1542
01:42:58.370 --> 01:43:00.266
You do know her.

1543
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:04.680
She was here.

1544
01:43:05.818 --> 01:43:08.749
She loved to be with
us inside the theater.


1545
01:43:08.784 --> 01:43:13.715
So she was like you, like me.

1546
01:43:13.749 --> 01:43:16.266
- I think my husband is gonnaleave me!

1547
01:43:20.163 --> 01:43:21.163
I'm sorry.

1548
01:43:22.749 --> 01:43:24.301
I don't know why I said that.

1549
01:43:26.370 --> 01:43:28.473
This feels like therapy.

1550
01:43:28.508 --> 01:43:31.473
I've never been but if
my therapist hugged me,


1551
01:43:31.508 --> 01:43:35.128
it might feel like this.

1552
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:41.060
- Elsa, you are in the theater.

1553
01:43:41.094 --> 01:43:42.370
Poor people therapy.

1554
01:43:47.439 --> 01:43:50.439
So, your husband.

1555
01:43:59.197 --> 01:44:00.439
I know, I know.

1556
01:44:00.473 --> 01:44:02.715
It was so nice of Claudiaand
Linda to come, I think.


1557
01:44:02.749 --> 01:44:03.680
- Oh wasn't it?

1558
01:44:03.715 --> 01:44:05.542
- Yes, so nice.

1559
01:44:05.577 --> 01:44:06.577
- Hi.

1560
01:44:09.404 --> 01:44:11.439
- Hi.

1561
01:44:11.473 --> 01:44:14.232
- I'm sorry, I should
have brought flowers.


1562
01:44:15.128 --> 01:44:17.680
I realized after, after theshow,

1563
01:44:17.715 --> 01:44:19.784
I realized I should have
brought flowers.


1564
01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:23.577
And there's no place opentonight.

1565
01:44:23.611 --> 01:44:26.163
And so I walked down the street

1566
01:44:26.197 --> 01:44:29.060
thinking I could just
pick some from a yard


1567
01:44:29.094 --> 01:44:31.163
just this once.

1568
01:44:31.197 --> 01:44:32.794
But this turns out to be
the only goddamn street


1569
01:44:32.818 --> 01:44:34.818
in America without flowers, sol just...

1570
01:44:36.473 --> 01:44:38.128
There's just trees.

1571
01:44:38.163 --> 01:44:40.094
So I just uh...

1572
01:44:40.128 --> 01:44:43.577
And you two, you both deserve

1573
01:44:47.404 --> 01:44:51.094
there's still some sap here.

1574
01:44:55.404 --> 01:44:56.404
I'm sorry.

1575
01:44:58.232 --> 01:44:59.301
You both deserve...

1576
01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:07.163
- You were there tonight?

1577
01:45:07.197 --> 01:45:10.818
- Yeah, I was a little late
getting in.


1578
01:45:11.784 --> 01:45:13.542
I missed the,

1579
01:45:13.577 --> 01:45:16.335
I'll come back, I want to
comeback anyway, I'll come back.


1580
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:20.128
- She is the Euripidestranslator
of her generation.


1581
01:45:20.163 --> 01:45:21.128
- Greta, stop.

1582
01:45:21.163 --> 01:45:23.266
- It was astonishing.

1583
01:45:23.301 --> 01:45:26.094
- Okay, goodnight.

1584
01:45:26.128 --> 01:45:27.197
- So were you.

1585
01:45:27.232 --> 01:45:28.646
- Thank you, gotta go.

1586
01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.335
Go and make sure Dorotheadoesn't
bring home more cats.


1587
01:45:35.818 --> 01:45:38.197
- Hey, you wanna walk for a bit?

1588
01:45:38.232 --> 01:45:39.473
Maybe just down the block?

1589
01:45:40.818 --> 01:45:45.611
We could take a take a little
time


1590
01:45:45.646 --> 01:45:46.646
to smell the,

1591
01:45:48.439 --> 01:45:49.439
oh, wait, nevermind.

1592
01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:03.094
- The smell of nevermind at
midnight.


1593
01:46:05.128 --> 01:46:06.577
The Greeks had a word for that.

1594
01:46:08.163 --> 01:46:09.163
- I believe it.

1595
01:49:14.404 --> 01:49:15.404
- What is it?

1596
01:49:17.508 --> 01:49:18.508
What's in there?

1597
01:49:20.439 --> 01:49:21.784
More repairs, fewer people.

1598
01:49:27.542 --> 01:49:29.197
Is the party over?

1599
01:49:29.232 --> 01:49:30.542
Is the war over?

1600
01:49:32.301 --> 01:49:34.060
What happened, how'd it turn
out?


1601
01:49:42.818 --> 01:49:46.680
- You are always carryingthings.

1602
01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:52.370
It is hard to be always
carrying things.


1603
01:49:59.301 --> 01:50:00.301
- What are we doing?

1604
01:50:01.818 --> 01:50:03.163
What are we doing here?

1605
01:50:13.784 --> 01:50:15.577
I'm having a crisis here!

1606
01:50:15.611 --> 01:50:18.060
Could you be a little less
supportive?


1607
01:50:18.094 --> 01:50:21.680
I'm trying to come unanchored.

1608
01:50:23.232 --> 01:50:25.611
- Oh, I should go?

1609
01:50:39.508 --> 01:50:40.508
- No.

1610
01:50:41.473 --> 01:50:43.370
- But I've come unanchored.

1611
01:51:12.370 --> 01:51:14.060
- How far are we going?

1612
01:51:14.094 --> 01:51:16.335
- How far do you feellike?

1613
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:18.094
- Could you leave?

1614
01:51:18.128 --> 01:51:20.577
Leave this beautiful sidewalk?

1615
01:51:20.611 --> 01:51:25.060
- The sidewalk, yes, but not you.

1616
01:51:25.094 --> 01:51:27.128
I am forever your date.

1617
01:51:27.163 --> 01:51:29.818
To the next party, the next war.

1618
01:51:32.232 --> 01:51:33.818
Tell the joke.

1619
01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:34.680
- What?

1620
01:51:34.715 --> 01:51:36.232
- Please.

1621
01:51:36.266 --> 01:51:37.266
- Seriously now?

1622
01:51:37.301 --> 01:51:39.404
- Now is the perfect time.

1623
01:51:42.197 --> 01:51:43.128
- Ole and Lena...

1624
01:51:43.163 --> 01:51:45.784
- No, with us, tell itwith us.

1625
01:51:45.818 --> 01:51:47.370
- Greta and Dorothea.
- Yeah.


1626
01:51:47.404 --> 01:51:49.197
- Had beentogether for a long time.

1627
01:51:49.232 --> 01:51:50.611
- And?

1628
01:51:50.646 --> 01:51:53.128
- And, one day, Dorothea,

1629
01:51:53.163 --> 01:51:55.508
she's not doing so well.

1630
01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:59.163
She's so weak, and shecalls
Greta to her bedside.


1631
01:51:59.197 --> 01:52:00.611
And she tells Greta,

1632
01:52:00.646 --> 01:52:03.542
Oh we've seen so much.

1633
01:52:04.611 --> 01:52:06.473
Remember when our building
caught on fire


1634
01:52:06.508 --> 01:52:08.060
and you were evacuated to theroof,

1635
01:52:08.094 --> 01:52:09.335
me across the street.

1636
01:52:09.370 --> 01:52:12.301
For hours, we didn't know
what happened to each other.


1637
01:52:12.335 --> 01:52:13.542
- I do remember.

1638
01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:17.784
I thought, maybe, I had lost
you.


1639
01:52:19.611 --> 01:52:20.680
- Remember when thetheater

1640
01:52:20.715 --> 01:52:22.439
flooded on opening night?

1641
01:52:22.473 --> 01:52:23.749
- On Seventh Street!

1642
01:52:23.784 --> 01:52:25.163
- You were in costume,

1643
01:52:25.197 --> 01:52:26.818
hiked up your skirt and helpedme bail

1644
01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:28.680
out the theater at half hour.

1645
01:52:28.715 --> 01:52:30.301
- Yeah, I thought thisis going

1646
01:52:30.335 --> 01:52:31.301
to happen every night?

1647
01:52:31.335 --> 01:52:33.370
I will need an earlier call
time!


1648
01:52:34.542 --> 01:52:36.335
- And remember whenmom died?

1649
01:52:36.370 --> 01:52:37.646
- Yes.

1650
01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.163
- We'd only beenon a
few dates and you came.


1651
01:52:40.197 --> 01:52:42.266
Not to my hometown, but
to the next town over.


1652
01:52:42.301 --> 01:52:45.163
You stayed in that crummy motel.

1653
01:52:45.197 --> 01:52:47.370
Even though you knew thatyou
couldn't be seen with me.


1654
01:52:47.404 --> 01:52:49.611
But you came to be near.

1655
01:52:49.646 --> 01:52:51.794
To give me a place to go
whenthey were driving me bonkers.


1656
01:52:51.818 --> 01:52:53.542
- Yes.

1657
01:52:53.577 --> 01:52:56.542
- And remember
when May from Alabama


1658
01:52:56.577 --> 01:53:00.197
and Ray from Australia came totown.

1659
01:53:00.232 --> 01:53:02.128
And built that eyesore downthe street

1660
01:53:02.163 --> 01:53:03.784
and took away our school
funding?


1661
01:53:03.818 --> 01:53:04.887
- Oh, yes.

1662
01:53:04.922 --> 01:53:06.439
- All those
terrible times, Greta.


1663
01:53:06.473 --> 01:53:08.370
You were always there, by myside.

1664
01:53:08.404 --> 01:53:09.611
- Yes.

1665
01:53:09.646 --> 01:53:12.577
- All thoseterrible times, you were there.

1666
01:53:12.611 --> 01:53:13.818
- Yes.

1667
01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:15.542
- I'm startingto think you're bad luck.

1668
01:53:20.335 --> 01:53:22.473
Why do you like that joke?

1669
01:56:15.508 --> 01:56:18.715
