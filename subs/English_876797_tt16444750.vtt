00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:27.002
<b>You haven't changed at all!</b>

158
00:15:27.342 --> 00:15:28.831
<b>This way!
Everyone's here!</b>


159
00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.842
<b>Hey, Miyuki! 
Show us your child!</b>

160
00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:40.309
<b>- Here.
- Wait!</b>


161
00:15:40.998 --> 00:15:43.366
<b>- Seems like he's gotten bigger again!
- Yeah.</b>


162
00:15:43.476 --> 00:15:46.243
<b>He's so hard-headed,
I'm having a hard time!</b>


163
00:15:46.343 --> 00:15:48.091
<b>But, he's undeniably cute!</b>

164
00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:50.099
<b>No, he's such a monster!</b>

165
00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:53.306
<b>Hey, Matsuri! Matsuri!
You're in Tokyo too, right?</b>


166
00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:56.693
<b>Tokyo? I envy you!</b>

167
00:15:56.783 --> 00:15:59.030
<b>Matsuri, where are you working?</b>

168
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.698
<b>Well…</b>

169
00:16:01.828 --> 00:16:04.455
<b>- Just an ordinary office worker.
- You have it good!</b>


170
00:16:04.495 --> 00:16:07.412
<b>An Office Lady at Tokyo.
What kind of work?</b>


171
00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:09.899
<b>Well…</b>

172
00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.237
<b>Publishing Industry.</b>

173
00:16:12.307 --> 00:16:14.535
<b>Publishing Industry?!</b>

174
00:16:14.984 --> 00:16:17.582
<b>Matsuri! You should join the group
next time for drinks!</b>


175
00:16:17.622 --> 00:16:19.070
<b>There you go!</b>

176
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.347
<b>There's only 3 of us there!
Right, Kazuto? Kazu?</b>


177
00:16:22.447 --> 00:16:24.954
<b>Let's have a drink together at Tokyo
next time, us three!</b>


178
00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:27.722
<b>Wait, Manabe's
in Tokyo, too?</b>


179
00:16:27.812 --> 00:16:30.189
<b>Didn't you, like,
inherit your father's company?</b>


180
00:16:30.249 --> 00:16:34.325
<b>He is such a mystery!
If he did, his life would have been secured!</b>


181
00:16:34.405 --> 00:16:35.534
<b>But why?</b>

182
00:16:35.614 --> 00:16:37.492
<b>Well, I've got
my own circumstances.</b>


183
00:16:37.572 --> 00:16:39.600
<b>What do you mean by that?!</b>

184
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.287
<b>Hey, Takeru! It's almost time
for the main event!</b>


185
00:16:42.357 --> 00:16:44.085
<b>Oh, right, right!</b>

186
00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:47.222
<b>Alright, everyone! Listen!
All eyes on me!</b>


187
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:50.589
<b>Do you guys remember what this is?</b>

188
00:16:51.568 --> 00:16:53.756
<b>Our time capsule!</b>

189
00:16:55.923 --> 00:16:58.301
<b>For the future us!</b>

190
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:02.547
<b>Once I call your name,
come up and claim yours!</b>


191
00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.134
<b>Kuro!</b>

192
00:17:05.214 --> 00:17:06.833
<b>Catch it!</b>

193
00:17:06.962 --> 00:17:08.561
<b>Hotpot right here!</b>

194
00:17:11.308 --> 00:17:12.996
<b>Alright, Matsuri!</b>

195
00:17:13.416 --> 00:17:14.745
<b>Here's yours.</b>

196
00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:17.012
<b>Alright, Manabe Kazuto.
Kazu!</b>


197
00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.371
<b>Here you go.</b>

198
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.848
<b>This is no good.</b>

199
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:22.826
<b>Alright, pass this around.</b>

200
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:24.705
<b>TO ME, 10 YEARS LATER.</b>

201
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:24.705
<b>ARE YOU DOING WELL?</b>

202
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:24.705
<b>NOW THAT I'M 14,</b>

203
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:24.705
<b>I'M SO HOOKED ABOUT</b>

204
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:24.705
<b>STUDYING AND CLUB ACTIVITIES</b>

205
00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:24.705
<b>EVERY DAY.</b>

206
00:17:23.186 --> 00:17:24.705
<b>Pass it!</b>

207
00:17:27.362 --> 00:17:33.376
<b>HOWEVER, I AM HAVING FUN AND DOING MY BEST. 
WHAT KIND OF WORK WILL I DO,
ONCE I BECOME A MEMBER OF THE WORKING SOCIETY?
WILL YOU HAVE A LOVER? WILL YOU DEBUT AS A NOVELIST?</b>


208
00:17:33.476 --> 00:17:35.334
<b>MAY YOU LIVE A WONDERFUL LIFE.</b>

209
00:17:44.765 --> 00:17:46.493
<b>Who wants to get
a second batch of drinks?</b>


210
00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:47.911
<b>Here!</b>

211
00:17:48.461 --> 00:17:50.499
<b>Alright, all of you, come this way!</b>

212
00:17:57.602 --> 00:17:58.850
<b>Manabe.</b>

213
00:17:59.929 --> 00:18:02.407
<b>Everyone's going for a second drink.</b>

214
00:18:15.684 --> 00:18:17.492
<b>Are you okay?</b>

215
00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:19.080
<b>Water.</b>

216
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.298
<b>It's been a while
since I last mingled with people.</b>


217
00:18:42.337 --> 00:18:45.803
<b>I'm so nervous that I can't even drink.</b>

218
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.558
<b>You must be thinking,
why did I even come, right?</b>


219
00:19:06.882 --> 00:19:08.611
<b>Takabayashi, you…</b>

220
00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:13.296
<b>I think you don't remember me at all.</b>

221
00:19:13.885 --> 00:19:14.904
<b>What?</b>

222
00:19:16.543 --> 00:19:18.451
<b>That's not true.</b>

223
00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:21.757
<b>In sophomore year…</b>

224
00:19:23.895 --> 00:19:26.283
<b>my school uniform button fell off…</b>

225
00:19:26.812 --> 00:19:30.579
<b>and when you fixed it for me,
I was so happy.</b>


226
00:19:36.203 --> 00:19:37.961
<b>I think that did happen.</b>

227
00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:42.936
<b>You really don't remember, do you?</b>

228
00:19:44.075 --> 00:19:45.124
<b>Yeah.</b>

229
00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:46.663
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

230
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.987
<b>Hey, let's get going!</b>

231
00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:55.204
<b>Stop flirting over there already.</b>

232
00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:02.497
<b>Everyone really grew into adults.</b>

233
00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:13.416
<b>It was so much fun.</b>

234
00:20:22.147 --> 00:20:24.115
<b>I had fun today.</b>

235
00:20:27.162 --> 00:20:28.700
<b>See you.</b>

236
00:21:14.684 --> 00:21:15.863
<b>This one, right?</b>

237
00:21:15.933 --> 00:21:19.380
<b>I want to put this here,
then the yellow ones in front.</b>


238
00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:26.842
<b>Wait.
What's with that get-up, Matsuri?</b>


239
00:21:27.192 --> 00:21:28.451
<b>Job interview.</b>

240
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:33.266
<b>Something happened at the class reunion?</b>

241
00:21:34.634 --> 00:21:36.323
<b>Nothing really.</b>

242
00:21:36.922 --> 00:21:39.160
<b>I might die of boredom.</b>

243
00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:41.458
<b>Matsuri.</b>

244
00:21:42.277 --> 00:21:45.414
<b>You shouldn't mention words like "die"
in-front of those two.</b>


245
00:21:46.313 --> 00:21:47.352
<b>I know.</b>

246
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:53.456
<b>You don't have to be in a rush.
Go at your own pace.</b>


247
00:21:55.853 --> 00:21:58.271
<b>- I'm off.
- Be well.</b>


248
00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:02.816
<b>Let's see.</b>

249
00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:05.983
<b>You dropped out of college
during your third year, correct?</b>


250
00:22:06.453 --> 00:22:07.571
<b>Yes.</b>

251
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:10.469
<b>Any part-time experiences?</b>

252
00:22:11.388 --> 00:22:12.786
<b>I don't have one.</b>

253
00:22:13.356 --> 00:22:14.574
<b>I see.</b>

254
00:22:16.622 --> 00:22:18.540
<b>By the way,</b>

255
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.878
<b>about your illness.</b>

256
00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:22.866
<b>Are you already cured?</b>

257
00:22:26.083 --> 00:22:27.252
<b>Well…</b>

258
00:23:39.499 --> 00:23:40.718
<b>Hello?</b>

259
00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:50.918
<b>Hey, Matsuri!</b>

260
00:23:51.238 --> 00:23:54.205
<b>Sorry for being late.
There was heavy traffic.</b>


261
00:23:54.834 --> 00:23:58.450
<b>But seriously, you being here
really saved my ass!</b>


262
00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:01.118
<b>What happened?</b>

263
00:24:02.077 --> 00:24:03.116
<b>Well…</b>

264
00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:06.622
<b>I don't get it myself, too.</b>

265
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.359
<b>He just kinda…</b>

266
00:24:10.968 --> 00:24:12.986
<b>jumped out from his</b>

267
00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:14.824
<b>room's balcony.</b>

268
00:24:16.972 --> 00:24:19.120
<b>He's not in a critical state, though.</b>

269
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.357
<b>I got a call from his parents
to come over to the hospital.</b>


270
00:24:23.236 --> 00:24:24.185
<b>No…</b>

271
00:24:24.924 --> 00:24:27.891
<b>His parents should be
the one to come here!</b>

272
00:24:44.914 --> 00:24:46.063
<b>Why are you…</b>

273
00:24:47.322 --> 00:24:49.240
<b>I got a call
from your parents.</b>


274
00:24:52.037 --> 00:24:53.935
<b>What happened to you?!</b>

275
00:24:58.321 --> 00:24:59.659
<b>I see.</b>

276
00:25:01.278 --> 00:25:02.736
<b>Sorry you had to come here.</b>

277
00:25:03.945 --> 00:25:05.643
<b>You too, Takabayashi.</b>

278
00:25:12.396 --> 00:25:13.695
<b>Seriously.</b>

279
00:25:16.412 --> 00:25:18.460
<b>Did you get into an argument
with your parents?</b>


280
00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:21.577
<b>Naturally,
they should be here!</b>


281
00:25:24.175 --> 00:25:26.752
<b>If they were ordinary parents, I guess.</b>

282
00:25:28.021 --> 00:25:29.090
<b>What?!</b>

283
00:25:30.558 --> 00:25:32.536
<b>They want to
cut ties with me, though.</b>


284
00:25:34.824 --> 00:25:37.501
<b>If I died, it's just
as they wanted it to be.</b>

285
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.169
<b>That's the reason?</b>

286
00:25:41.987 --> 00:25:44.055
<b>Don't know what came over me.</b>

287
00:25:46.722 --> 00:25:47.811
<b>Hey!</b>

288
00:25:50.718 --> 00:25:51.957
<b>Is it about work?</b>

289
00:25:55.134 --> 00:25:57.292
<b>I got fired last month.</b>

290
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.229
<b>No.</b>

291
00:26:00.998 --> 00:26:03.525
<b>- But that's just---
- I had so much fun.</b>


292
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.747
<b>It's been a while
since I last saw everyone.</b>

293
00:26:13.056 --> 00:26:16.332
<b>Everyone's just living their own lives
just as they could.</b>


294
00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:19.939
<b>Aside from me.</b>

295
00:26:21.337 --> 00:26:23.206
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

296
00:26:26.223 --> 00:26:28.131
<b>In my time capsule…</b>

297
00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:35.753
<b>I wrote, "Please live a good life,
once you become an adult."</b>


298
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.458
<b>Seems so stupid, right?</b>

299
00:26:42.886 --> 00:26:47.661
<b>I came to Tokyo without permission because
I didn't want to be controlled by my parents.</b>


300
00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:52.676
<b>I don't even know my purpose in life.</b>

301
00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:57.421
<b>When I thought about how these days
might keep dragging on longer…</b>


302
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.928
<b>it just came rushing out.</b>

303
00:27:02.356 --> 00:27:05.064
<b>What do you even mean by that?</b>

304
00:27:07.551 --> 00:27:09.469
<b>- Matsuri?
- I'm sorry.</b>


305
00:27:09.629 --> 00:27:10.828
<b>I need to go.</b>

306
00:27:12.117 --> 00:27:13.745
<b>Why?
What happened?</b>


307
00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:23.495
<b>I may not know
much about you, Manabe…</b>


308
00:27:25.483 --> 00:27:27.491
<b>but that's so unfair of you.</b>

309
00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:30.728
<b>Be well.</b>

310
00:28:36.702 --> 00:28:38.410
<b>Ms. Takabayashi!</b>

311
00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:52.336
<b>You may proceed to the clinic upstairs.</b>

312

<b>You're in good condition.</b>

313
00:29:00.998 --> 00:29:03.325
<b>We'll maintain your medicine dosage.</b>

314
00:29:03.895 --> 00:29:07.291
<b>Please continue to control your salt intake

315
00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.249
<b>Alright.</b>

316
00:29:10.878 --> 00:29:12.097
<b>How has it been?</b>

317
00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:13.705
<b>How's life at home?</b>

318
00:29:15.433 --> 00:29:17.121
<b>I've got too much free time.</b>

319
00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:19.050
<b>I can't even work.</b>

320
00:29:19.809 --> 00:29:23.585
<b>It made me feel about how this will
keep dragging on for how many years.</b>


321
00:29:25.183 --> 00:29:26.412
<b>Matsuri.</b>

322
00:29:27.042 --> 00:29:29.829
<b>I know you have looked up
a lot of information about this disease,</b>


323
00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:32.286
<b>but anything is possible
with this disease.</b>


324
00:29:33.145 --> 00:29:35.293
<b>Medical standards are also improving,</b>

325
00:29:35.733 --> 00:29:37.501
<b>so let's both do our best!</b>

326
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:42.906
<b>I'm looking forward to the day
you create that special medicine soon.</b>


327
00:29:45.603 --> 00:29:46.832
<b>Of course.</b>

328
00:29:47.121 --> 00:29:48.540
<b>I'll do my best.</b>

329
00:29:53.795 --> 00:29:55.373
<b>Mail for you.</b>

330
00:29:55.553 --> 00:29:58.021
<b>Wasn't this from your
class reunion last time?</b>


331
00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.169
<b>What?</b>

332
00:30:03.235 --> 00:30:04.584
<b>Let me see.</b>

333
00:30:05.523 --> 00:30:07.331
<b>Oh, my.</b>

334
00:30:11.517 --> 00:30:13.425
<b>Is this Miyuki?</b>

335
00:30:13.795 --> 00:30:16.632
<b>She looks like a completely different person!</b>

336
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.127
<b>Everyone's grown into adults.</b>

337
00:30:36.782 --> 00:30:37.871
<b>Yes?</b>

338
00:30:40.318 --> 00:30:42.276
<b><i>It's me, 
Manabe.</i></b>

339
00:30:42.916 --> 00:30:43.955
<b>What?</b>

340
00:30:44.594 --> 00:30:47.141
<b><i>Well, I… I just…</i></b>

341
00:30:47.601 --> 00:30:51.497
<b><i>I got discharged last week, and was
wondering if we could talk for a while?</i></b>


342
00:30:51.687 --> 00:30:54.284
<b><i>Let's celebrate!
I'll send the address to you.</i></b>


343
00:30:54.364 --> 00:30:56.442
<b><i>I just sent it.
All good?</i></b>


344
00:30:56.492 --> 00:30:59.499
<b><i>- Okay? Alright, hanging up. I sent it.</i>
- Hey, wait. No, wait.</b>


345
00:31:04.494 --> 00:31:08.070
<b>Every time I come here,
I keep eating everything.</b>


346
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.867
<b>So many original dishes,
and "Gen's Special" is specially good!</b>


347
00:31:12.626 --> 00:31:13.985
<b>Thanks for the wait!</b>

348
00:31:14.694 --> 00:31:17.990
<b>Mr. Gen!
These are my classmates from middle-school.</b>


349
00:31:19.139 --> 00:31:20.498
<b>Welcome.</b>

350
00:31:21.347 --> 00:31:24.194
<b>Mr. Gen is like
my father here in Tokyo.</b>

351
00:31:24.324 --> 00:31:27.191
<b>I always come to him for advices!</b>

352
00:31:27.651 --> 00:31:29.249
<b>Enjoy your time.</b>

353
00:31:29.959 --> 00:31:30.958
<b>Yes.</b>

354
00:31:31.917 --> 00:31:34.874
<b>Alright, now that everybody's here,
let's drink to that.</b>


355
00:31:36.382 --> 00:31:37.461
<b>Alright.</b>

356
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.878
<b>Congrats on getting discharged!</b>

357
00:31:40.977 --> 00:31:42.916
<b>Cheers!</b>

358
00:31:50.598 --> 00:31:52.136
<b>You know what?</b>

359
00:31:52.896 --> 00:31:55.923
<b>We'll listen to what you have to say,
no matter what. Right, Matsuri?</b>


360
00:31:56.122 --> 00:31:57.201
<b>Why me?</b>

361
00:31:57.841 --> 00:32:01.117
<b>Well you know,
the mood kinda turned weird last time.</b>


362
00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:04.244
<b>Kazu here wants to say something.</b>

363
00:32:06.132 --> 00:32:07.081
<b>Go ahead.</b>

364
00:32:19.709 --> 00:32:21.387
<b>What? Am I interfering?</b>

365
00:32:21.487 --> 00:32:22.666
<b>No.</b>

366
00:32:23.915 --> 00:32:25.443
<b>I just need a moment.
Sorry about that.</b>


367
00:32:25.563 --> 00:32:27.051
<b>- Yeah.
- My bad.</b>


368
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.238
<b>Yeah, yeah. I got it.</b>

369
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.008
<b>About that other day…</b>

370
00:32:40.598 --> 00:32:41.966
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

371
00:32:43.365 --> 00:32:44.654
<b>No…</b>

372
00:32:44.913 --> 00:32:47.121
<b>I owe you an apology, too.</b>

373
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.378
<b>Congrats on your discharge.</b>

374
00:32:52.985 --> 00:32:54.794
<b>Well, it's just…</b>

375
00:32:59.509 --> 00:33:00.957
<b>I…</b>

376
00:33:02.216 --> 00:33:03.325
<b>I saw you.</b>

377
00:33:07.801 --> 00:33:09.589
<b>Is she sick?</b>

378
00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:15.992
<b>Your mom?</b>

379
00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:18.700
<b>What?</b>

380
00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.266
<b>I've been thinking about
what you said this whole time.</b>


381
00:33:33.045 --> 00:33:34.154
<b>Well…</b>

382
00:33:34.544 --> 00:33:36.452
<b>when you said
I was being unfair.</b>


383
00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:39.739
<b>Even when there's people out there
who wants to live, but can't,</b>


384
00:33:39.878 --> 00:33:42.895
<b>and I wasn't thinking about how
you felt about it.</b>


385
00:33:43.275 --> 00:33:45.333
<b>I said a bunch of childish stuff.</b>

386
00:33:45.703 --> 00:33:47.281
<b>I'm really…</b>

387
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.139
<b>really sorry.</b>

388
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.437
<b>Can you not kill off my mom one-sidedly?</b>

389
00:34:01.836 --> 00:34:04.534
<b>No, I'm sorry. 
I didn't mean it that way.</b>

390
00:34:05.753 --> 00:34:08.040
<b>What did you mean, then?</b>

391
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.789
<b>Well, as I said…</b>

392
00:34:11.577 --> 00:34:12.955
<b>How do I say this…?</b>

393
00:34:13.005 --> 00:34:15.663
<b>- Hey, Takeru.
- Hey, you done?</b>


394
00:34:16.062 --> 00:34:18.680
<b>Manabe killed my mom.</b>

395
00:34:19.269 --> 00:34:22.915
<b>- What? Really?
- No, no. That's not what I meant!</b>


396
00:34:22.965 --> 00:34:25.513
<b>- What happened?
- Explain it well.</b>


397
00:34:25.653 --> 00:34:28.180
<b>- What were you talking about?
- I was joking.</b>


398
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.958
<b>- So? What?
- Well…</b>


399
00:34:30.058 --> 00:34:32.536
<b>We should come together again soon!</b>

400
00:34:32.636 --> 00:34:34.883
<b>Hey, Kazu!
Make sure you take her home!</b>


401
00:34:34.963 --> 00:34:36.941
<b>- I know.
- Got that?</b>


402
00:34:37.081 --> 00:34:39.399
<b>- We can go now.
- See you.</b>


403
00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:40.658
<b>- Bye-bye!
- See you.</b>


404
00:34:51.357 --> 00:34:53.305
<b>Sorry, it's my dad.</b>

405
00:34:56.342 --> 00:34:57.551
<b>Yes?</b>

406
00:34:59.039 --> 00:35:00.498
<b>On my way home now.</b>

407
00:35:01.886 --> 00:35:04.094
<b>It's okay, I can go back by myself.</b>

408
00:35:06.172 --> 00:35:07.311
<b>Yeah.</b>

409
00:35:13.335 --> 00:35:15.543
<b>You seem very close with your family.</b>

410
00:35:16.562 --> 00:35:18.210
<b>They're too overprotective.</b>

411
00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:21.577
<b>I'm already an adult, though.</b>

412
00:35:29.179 --> 00:35:30.827
<b>So pretty.</b>

413
00:35:41.467 --> 00:35:43.784
<b>Why do you have that?</b>

414
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.577
<b>When I see something nice,
I want to leave a memory of it.</b>


415
00:35:53.245 --> 00:35:54.664
<b>Really?</b>

416
00:35:55.952 --> 00:35:57.371
<b>Kinda nice.</b>

417
00:36:02.076 --> 00:36:04.234
<b>What are you gonna do from now on?</b>

418
00:36:04.654 --> 00:36:06.482
<b>Why the sudden question?</b>

419
00:36:06.682 --> 00:36:08.160
<b>From now on?</b>

420
00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:09.669
<b>Well…</b>

421
00:36:09.758 --> 00:36:11.557
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

422
00:36:13.694 --> 00:36:15.623
<b>For now…</b>

423
00:36:17.121 --> 00:36:19.269
<b>gotta find a job…</b>

424
00:36:20.038 --> 00:36:23.035
<b>- and pay my rent.
- What's with that?</b>


425
00:36:23.884 --> 00:36:26.042
<b>You must have something else.</b>

426
00:36:26.632 --> 00:36:29.499
<b>Something else? 
What else?</b>

427
00:36:33.375 --> 00:36:35.043
<b>Let's see…</b>

428
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.579
<b>What about…?</b>

429
00:36:40.518 --> 00:36:41.916
<b>Then…</b>

430
00:36:44.564 --> 00:36:46.661
<b>I'll do my best, too.</b>

431
00:36:50.358 --> 00:36:53.375
<b>So please don't ever think again
about wanting to die.</b>


432
00:37:00.288 --> 00:37:01.577
<b>You got it.</b>

433
00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:44.623
<b>That startled me!</b>

434
00:37:56.831 --> 00:37:58.330
<b><i>You got it.</i></b>

435
00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:10.488
<b>What? Really? 
Is that guy okay now?</b>

436
00:38:10.627 --> 00:38:11.616
<b>I wonder.</b>

437
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:18.040
<b>Over here.</b>

438
00:38:20.428 --> 00:38:22.436
<b>It surprised me a bit.</b>

439
00:38:22.725 --> 00:38:25.912
<b>If I were you,
I'd be fuming mad at him.</b>


440
00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.989
<b>Well…</b>

441
00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:32.116
<b>I can kinda understand
where he's coming from.</b>


442
00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:35.163
<b>Like, wanting to run away from something.</b>

443
00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:39.578
<b>Anyway, as my senior at work,</b>

444
00:38:39.788 --> 00:38:42.036
<b>I might as well
let you look over me.</b>

445
00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:44.414
<b>But Matsuri, starting today…</b>

446
00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:48.020
<b>I love you, Sanae!</b>

447
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.998
<b>Thank you!</b>

448
00:38:50.807 --> 00:38:53.325
<b>You gotta introduce me to

449
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:58.949
<b>The Editor-in-Chief is here.

<b>Not at all!</b>

455
00:39:18.549 --> 00:39:20.448
<b>- I'll do my best.

<b>What kind of work?</b>

464

<b>A Column Writer.</b>

00:40:35.962 --> 00:40:37.460
<b>Welcome.</b>

473
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.999
<b>Alright.</b>

474

<b>- Thanks for waiting!
- Yeah, thank you.</b>


475

<b>- Too much foam, though?
- I overdid it!</b>


476
00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:50.787
<b>Does it fit me?</b>

477
00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:53.704
<b>Well, surprisingly…</b>

478
00:40:56.571 --> 00:41:00.997
<b>I mean, Mr. Gen is old. He needs all the help
he can get, I told him to hire part-timers.</b>


479
00:41:01.476 --> 00:41:04.783
<b>And just by chance,
this guy is unemployed, so you know…?</b>


480
00:41:04.893 --> 00:41:07.261
<b>You're the one who forced it on me.</b>

481
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.789
<b>Yeah, my bad.</b>

482
00:41:11.187 --> 00:41:12.455

483
00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:14.244
<b>I…</b>

484
00:41:15.213 --> 00:41:18.040
<b>I've been thinking
of a lot of things since that day…</b>


485
00:41:19.788 --> 00:41:21.207
<b>How do I put this…?</b>

486
00:41:21.856 --> 00:41:23.105
<b>For now…</b>

487
00:41:23.285 --> 00:41:26.062
<b>I just wanna try doing what I can.</b>

488
00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:33.245
<b>I think that's great.</b>

489

<b>Should we try changing your medication?</b>

573

00:57:34.622 --> 00:57:36.790
<b>I'm just anemic.</b>

622
00:57:42.005 --> 00:57:43.843
<b>Your father told me.</b>

623
00:57:47.469 --> 00:57:50.367
<b>"I hope you can accept
everything about Matsuri."</b>


624
00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:55.332
<b>Tell me.</b>

625
00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:09.747
<b>I got a respiratory organ disease
when I was 20 years old.</b>


626
00:58:15.811 --> 00:58:17.829
<b>I had a surgery.</b>

627
00:58:21.405 --> 00:58:23.923
<b>I still have scars due to that.</b>

628
00:58:25.132 --> 00:58:27.849
<b>It may trigger asthma…</b>

629
00:58:28.998 --> 00:58:31.565
<b>and I'm not allowed to do
any strenuous activity.</b>


630
00:58:36.111 --> 00:58:37.609
<b>Sorry.</b>

631
00:58:39.068 --> 00:58:41.465
<b>I was acting so self-righteous to you,</b>

632
00:58:41.725 --> 00:58:43.523
<b>when I'm in such a state.</b>

633
00:58:45.052 --> 00:58:46.760
<b>Funny, right?</b>

634
00:58:48.179 --> 00:58:49.697
<b>That's not true.</b>

635
00:58:51.565 --> 00:58:53.623
<b>You just gotta rest well for now.</b>

636
00:58:57.579 --> 00:58:58.938
<b>No.</b>

637
00:59:04.223 --> 00:59:05.282
<b>I…</b>

638
00:59:05.881 --> 00:59:08.818
<b>I'm not the kind of person
you thought me to be.</b>


639
00:59:20.876 --> 00:59:23.094
<b>Don't come here anymore.</b>

640
00:59:30.696 --> 00:59:32.464
<b>I don't want to see you.</b>

641
01:00:12.624 --> 01:00:14.352
<b>I'm going now.</b>

642
01:00:15.182 --> 01:00:16.530
<b>Where are you going?</b>

643
01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.039
<b>Just somewhere.</b>

644
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:20.177
<b>You just got discharged.
Will you be alright?</b>


645
01:00:20.246 --> 01:00:22.294
<b>I'll be fine. 
You worry too much.</b>

646
01:00:22.404 --> 01:00:23.533
<b>Matsuri.</b>

647
01:00:25.241 --> 01:00:26.760
<b>You have a moment?</b>

648
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:28.368
<b>What's wrong?</b>

649
01:00:28.938 --> 01:00:31.655
<b>Something I need to
consult with you about. You too, dad.</b>


650
01:00:42.065 --> 01:00:43.563
<b>This hospital.</b>

651
01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:45.891
<b>Lung transplants
are available here.</b>


652
01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:48.558
<b>A special unit was just recently established.</b>

653
01:00:51.845 --> 01:00:52.814
<b>I…</b>

654
01:00:53.753 --> 01:00:57.229
<b>We were thinking of consulting
Dr. Hirata about it,</b>


655
01:00:57.579 --> 01:01:00.576
<b>to see if we can
transfer you to a different hospital.</b>


656
01:01:05.881 --> 01:01:07.739
<b>What do you think, Matsuri?</b>

657
01:01:10.506 --> 01:01:12.884
<b>My body can't be cured from
this disease anyway.</b>


658
01:01:13.054 --> 01:01:15.321
<b>We've tried a lot already, haven't we?</b>

659
01:01:15.821 --> 01:01:17.699
<b>That might true…</b>

660
01:01:18.538 --> 01:01:19.357
<b>But…</b>

661
01:01:20.556 --> 01:01:22.944
<b>medicines are always advancing.</b>

662
01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.701
<b>The situation might also slowly change.</b>

663
01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:27.399
<b>You know?</b>

664
01:01:27.489 --> 01:01:31.625
<b>Once you feel like it, we can always
go and see the Doctor anytime.</b>


665
01:01:32.035 --> 01:01:34.582
<b>- There's a possibility--
- Give it up.</b>


666
01:01:38.748 --> 01:01:41.215
<b>No matter how difficult it is
to cure this disease,</b>


667
01:01:41.485 --> 01:01:44.782
<b>if there's any way to cure it at all,
I will do my very best.</b>


668
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:47.619
<b>But this disease
doesn't have that.</b>


669
01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:55.012
<b>It's not that I've given up on fighting.</b>

670
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.197
<b>I just can no longer fight back.</b>

671
01:02:02.504 --> 01:02:03.813
<b>Matsuri.</b>

672
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.888
<b>I don't think what you said is wrong.</b>

673
01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.944
<b>The fact that you're
bravely confronting your illness…</b>


674
01:02:13.064 --> 01:02:14.962
<b>is so admirable of you.</b>

675
01:02:15.931 --> 01:02:18.868
<b>But, I want you to understand
how Kikyo feels.</b>


676
01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:21.455
<b>They're thinking of you,</b>

677
01:02:21.575 --> 01:02:24.073
<b>- and only want---
- Of course, I know that!</b>


678
01:02:37.499 --> 01:02:39.317
<b>You know what?</b>

679
01:02:42.264 --> 01:02:44.122
<b>We all look so pathetic.</b>

680
01:02:52.504 --> 01:02:53.493
<b>Sorry.</b>

681
01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.041
<b>Forget what I just said.</b>

682
01:02:57.909 --> 01:03:00.246
<b>I made plans to meet a friend.</b>

683
01:03:01.355 --> 01:03:02.244
<b>I need to go.</b>

684
01:03:05.291 --> 01:03:06.120
<b>Wait.</b>

685
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.228
<b>Matsuri.</b>

686
01:03:28.498 --> 01:03:29.387
<b>Miya!</b>

687
01:03:29.467 --> 01:03:32.664
<b>Congrats on your engagement!</b>

688
01:03:32.764 --> 01:03:35.201
<b>- Thank you, Akira!
- My pleasure as well.</b>


689
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.187
<b>Seriously, a restaurant owner?</b>

690
01:03:39.307 --> 01:03:43.483
<b>- I think you're being deceived, Akira.
- Oh, come on! Don't say that!</b>


691
01:03:43.823 --> 01:03:46.230
<b>Did you take a look at it?
You see how it looks?</b>


692
01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.388
<b>- It's cute.
- Really cute.</b>


693
01:03:49.127 --> 01:03:50.856
<b>By the way, Akkun.</b>

694
01:03:51.265 --> 01:03:52.204
<b>Hey, Matsuri.</b>

695
01:03:52.474 --> 01:03:55.391
<b>You don't have
a boyfriend right now, do you?</b>


696
01:03:57.929 --> 01:04:00.076
<b>There's someone I want to introduce to you.</b>

697
01:04:03.023 --> 01:04:04.702
<b>A classmate of mine
from middle school.</b>


698
01:04:05.191 --> 01:04:08.128
<b>He's the one who did the
interior design for this store.</b>


699
01:04:08.728 --> 01:04:11.885
<b>A first-class architect.
A really great person!</b>


700
01:04:11.995 --> 01:04:14.642
<b>What? How sly! I envy you, Matsuri!</b>

701
01:04:15.381 --> 01:04:17.949
<b>But you know, how do I put this…?</b>

702
01:04:18.508 --> 01:04:20.076
<b>There's just one thing…</b>

703
01:04:21.445 --> 01:04:24.532
<b>and this might sound a bit heavy, right?</b>

704
01:04:27.139 --> 01:04:29.577
<b>In the past, he's…</b>

705
01:04:30.806 --> 01:04:32.244
<b>How do you say it…?</b>

706
01:04:35.011 --> 01:04:37.369
<b>He had a heart disease.</b>

707
01:04:38.468 --> 01:04:40.706
<b>But he's got no problems in life, though.</b>

708
01:04:43.143 --> 01:04:44.092
<b>See?</b>

709
01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:47.409
<b>I was thinking that since he's been
through that kind of hard experience,</b>


710
01:04:47.909 --> 01:04:51.225
<b>that maybe you'd both see eye-to-eye.</b>

711
01:04:52.254 --> 01:04:54.512
<b>Really? Lately, you've been---</b>

712
01:04:54.582 --> 01:04:57.619
<b>What? Sounds good.
You gotta introduce me!</b>


713
01:05:00.026 --> 01:05:01.505
<b>I'm so relieved.</b>

714
01:05:01.615 --> 01:05:03.853
<b>Age? How old is he? A hottie?</b>

715
01:05:03.953 --> 01:05:06.100
<b>- I think he is.
- Don't we have a cute photo of him?</b>


716
01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.748
<b>- Oh, right.
- I think we have one.</b>


717
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.008
<b>Kazuto.</b>

718
01:05:18.718 --> 01:05:20.686
<b>Move your hands.</b>

719
01:05:22.034 --> 01:05:23.313
<b>Sorry.</b>

720
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.848
<b>Something happened between you and Matsuri?</b>

721
01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.625
<b>Yes.</b>

722
01:05:34.772 --> 01:05:35.940
<b>I see.</b>

723
01:05:38.198 --> 01:05:40.286
<b>Then you got to move on.</b>

724
01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:41.705
<b>On to the next one.</b>

725
01:05:43.962 --> 01:05:45.701
<b>There's no next one.</b>

726
01:05:51.745 --> 01:05:53.603
<b>You say such good things.</b>

727
01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:58.868
<b>I guess there is no next, huh?</b>

728
01:05:59.567 --> 01:06:03.353
<b>You only have one life,
so how you choose is up to you.</b>


729
01:06:07.569 --> 01:06:10.826
<b>Being able to meet the one you love…</b>

730
01:06:11.515 --> 01:06:13.713
<b>is already a miracle itself.</b>

731
01:06:17.918 --> 01:06:20.446
<b>But, you have luck on your side.</b>

732
01:06:23.183 --> 01:06:25.581
<b>Because you were able to meet that person.</b>

733
01:06:43.513 --> 01:06:44.911
<b>Kazuto.</b>

734
01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.598
<b>You can finish your shift now.</b>

735
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:59.367
<b>Thank you so much.</b>

736
01:08:30.076 --> 01:08:31.235
<b>Matsuri.</b>

737
01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:12.504
<b>Matsuri!</b>

738
01:09:17.798 --> 01:09:19.247
<b>I'm glad!</b>

739
01:09:20.516 --> 01:09:21.744
<b>So glad!</b>

740
01:09:23.163 --> 01:09:24.662
<b>Why are you here?</b>

741
01:09:28.887 --> 01:09:30.086
<b>Well…</b>

742
01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:36.390
<b>I only know that this station is
close to your home so…</b>


743
01:09:37.928 --> 01:09:40.186
<b>So I was waiting
for you around this area.</b>

744
01:09:48.458 --> 01:09:49.597
<b>Matsuri.</b>

745
01:09:50.076 --> 01:09:51.115
<b>Are you okay?</b>

746
01:09:58.927 --> 01:10:00.456
<b>What brought you here?</b>

747
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.599
<b>Matsuri, I…</b>

748
01:10:09.666 --> 01:10:11.245
<b>I found a dream.</b>

749
01:10:12.803 --> 01:10:14.052
<b>A dream?</b>

750
01:10:20.506 --> 01:10:22.354
<b>My life…</b>

751
01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:27.389
<b>From the point of view
of someone else…</b>


752
01:10:27.868 --> 01:10:29.507
<b>they might see as an…</b>

753
01:10:30.496 --> 01:10:32.783
<b>ordinary, boring life.</b>

754
01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:40.456
<b>But I have you by my side.</b>

755
01:10:50.116 --> 01:10:52.813
<b>I used to think of wanting to die…</b>

756
01:10:56.849 --> 01:11:00.066
<b>but you made me realize that I want
to live, and it's because of you…</b>


757
01:11:02.234 --> 01:11:04.532
<b>that I will keep this life.</b>

758
01:11:13.123 --> 01:11:14.791
<b>From now on…</b>

759
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:19.097
<b>I'll be there to protect you.</b>

760
01:11:21.964 --> 01:11:23.163
<b>So…</b>

761
01:11:27.908 --> 01:11:29.776
<b>please stay with me.</b>

762
01:11:43.293 --> 01:11:44.841
<b>You dummy.</b>

763
01:11:52.763 --> 01:11:54.212
<b>Matsuri?</b>

764
01:11:57.319 --> 01:11:59.037
<b>I like you.</b>

765
01:12:02.064 --> 01:12:05.321
<b>I shouldn't have gone to that class reunion.</b>

766
01:12:24.811 --> 01:12:26.440
<b>It's so cold.</b>

926
01:26:40.245 --> 01:26:42.333
<b>I can no longer be with you.</b>

927
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:47.048
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

928
01:27:01.504 --> 01:27:03.821
<b>Incurable?</b>

929
01:27:07.448 --> 01:27:09.206
<b>How about medicines or…</b>

930
01:27:09.685 --> 01:27:12.283
<b>Or if you get hospitalized for
regular treatment…</b>


931
01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.791
<b>It won't work.</b>

932
01:27:18.227 --> 01:27:21.034
<b>Generally, no one can live another 10 years.</b>

933
01:27:26.748 --> 01:27:28.117
<b>Goodbye.</b>

934
01:27:33.422 --> 01:27:37.947
<b>Wait. No, wait. Wait, just wait.
I'm sorry, okay?</b>


935
01:27:39.556 --> 01:27:40.924
<b>I just…</b>

936
01:27:41.494 --> 01:27:43.641
<b>My mind's in a mess and…</b>

937
01:27:46.589 --> 01:27:47.787
<b>Why?</b>

938
01:27:48.606 --> 01:27:50.455
<b>Why does it have to be you?</b>

939
01:27:52.283 --> 01:27:54.541
<b>I've been thinking about it all this time.</b>

940
01:27:56.808 --> 01:27:59.336
<b>"Why did it have to be me?"</b>

941
01:28:01.084 --> 01:28:03.352
<b>Last 10 years? 
How ridiculous.</b>

942
01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:06.748
<b>You think it's long or too short?</b>

943
01:28:07.877 --> 01:28:10.235
<b>Whichever it is, it's still my win.</b>

944
01:28:12.912 --> 01:28:15.540
<b>I thought I was
bored out of my mind.</b>

945
01:28:16.019 --> 01:28:18.477
<b>"Let me die already"…</b>

946
01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:22.183
<b>was what I used to think everyday.</b>

947
01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.197
<b>But…</b>

948
01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:46.199
<b>since I met you…</b>

949
01:28:48.846 --> 01:28:50.944
<b>every day has been so much fun.</b>

950
01:28:56.439 --> 01:28:58.946
<b>But this is as far I can go.</b>

951
01:29:07.967 --> 01:29:10.355
<b>If I stay with you any longer…</b>

952
01:29:12.652 --> 01:29:14.790
<b>it'll make me fear death.</b>

953
01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:23.032
<b>I…</b>

954
01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:25.999
<b>I…</b>

955
01:29:28.546 --> 01:29:30.654
<b>I like you, Matsuri!</b>

956
01:29:47.617 --> 01:29:48.876
<b>Kazu?</b>

957
01:29:52.612 --> 01:29:55.310
<b>For making me your girlfriend…</b>

958
01:29:56.818 --> 01:29:58.157
<b>Thank you.</b>

959
01:30:00.105 --> 01:30:01.284
<b>No!</b>

960
01:30:02.562 --> 01:30:04.041
<b>Kazu, you…</b>

961
01:30:05.529 --> 01:30:08.117
<b>You need to get yourself together and live.</b>

962
01:30:09.006 --> 01:30:10.744
<b>I don't want it.</b>

963
01:30:13.661 --> 01:30:15.050
<b>I'm asking you.</b>

964
01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:17.657
<b>Just say you understand.</b>

965
01:30:21.354 --> 01:30:24.490
<b>I need to start preparing for death.</b>

966
01:30:27.997 --> 01:30:29.955
<b>This is my last wish.</b>

967
01:30:42.862 --> 01:30:43.991
<b>I got it.</b>

968
01:30:49.046 --> 01:30:50.245
<b>Thank you.</b>

969
01:31:23.541 --> 01:31:24.660
<b>Welcome back.</b>

970
01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.779
<b>I'm home.</b>

971
01:31:25.889 --> 01:31:28.746
<b>Welcome back. 
You're home early.</b>

972
01:31:57.088 --> 01:31:58.726
<b>Looks good.</b>

973
01:31:59.086 --> 01:32:01.763
<b>Dinner will be served in a while.</b>

974
01:32:02.442 --> 01:32:04.181
<b>How was the trip?</b>

975
01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:26.289
<b>Matsuri?</b>

976
01:32:31.264 --> 01:32:32.922
<b>Hey, mom?</b>

977
01:32:50.734 --> 01:32:52.033
<b>I…</b>

978
01:32:56.388 --> 01:32:58.966
<b>I want to live more.</b>

979
01:33:08.536 --> 01:33:10.205
<b>I also want…</b>

980
01:33:11.124 --> 01:33:13.152
<b>to travel a bit more.</b>

981
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:17.507
<b>I want to go out with my friends…</b>

982
01:33:18.276 --> 01:33:19.865
<b>and be able to work…</b>

983
01:33:21.234 --> 01:33:23.821
<b>and I want to get married too…</b>

984
01:33:30.984 --> 01:33:32.772
<b>I haven't even…</b>

<b>experienced being a mother.</b>

986
01:33:38.766 --> 01:33:41.723
<b>I'm sorry for always causing so much trouble.</b>

987

<b>You know what?</b>

989
01:33:51.283 --> 01:33:53.112
<b>I've always regretted it.</b>

990
01:33:54.031 --> 01:33:56.978
<b>The day the Doctor
told me about your illness…</b>


991
01:33:57.347 --> 01:34:00.055
<b>we were all feeling downhearted.</b>

992
01:34:01.114 --> 01:34:03.172
<b>We started crying</b>

993
01:34:03.331 --> 01:34:04.870
<b>before you even could.</b>

994
01:34:06.558 --> 01:34:09.505
<b>That's why you've never cried
all this time, right?</b>


995
01:34:10.764 --> 01:34:12.282
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

996
01:34:16.468 --> 01:34:17.837
<b>But you know?</b>

997
01:34:20.664 --> 01:34:23.301
<b>It's totally fine if you want to…</b>

998
01:34:23.831 --> 01:34:25.539
<b>cry a little bit more,</b>

999
01:34:26.348 --> 01:34:28.596
<b>shout and rant a bit more, too.</b>

1000
01:34:31.553 --> 01:34:33.931
<b>I will accept all of that!</b>

1001
01:34:46.718 --> 01:34:48.446
<b>I don't want to die.</b>

1002
01:34:53.651 --> 01:34:55.569
<b>I don't want to die!</b>

<b>Sounds good?</b>

01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:25.159
<b>Seems like
something you'd do.</b>


1009
01:36:28.556 --> 01:36:30.284
<b>I thought so, too.</b>

1010
01:36:32.392 --> 01:36:33.831
<b>I'll have it here.</b>

<b>How do I put this…?</b>

1018

<b>You know,

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>Not really.</b>

<b>Oh, stop it, will you?</b>

1047
01:39:56.448 --> 01:39:57.627
<b>It's fine.</b>

1048
01:39:57.727 --> 01:39:59.605
<b>It's just fiction, after all.</b>

1049
01:40:00.644 --> 01:40:03.851
<b>I added in the book
that you're having a baby.</b>
