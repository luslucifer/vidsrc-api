00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.870
SUMMERTIME

2
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.910
- You didn't take any corn at all?
- No.


3
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.630
Antoine's parents are
starting to plant it.


4
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.270
Sweetie, the day you have a husband,
you can ask him to plant corn.


5
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.030
But if you keep letting
them go one after another...


6
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.350
Your friends are faster.

7
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.270
I don't want to get married.

8
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.430
I don't want to get married.

9
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.270
What are you doing every night?

10
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.190
Getting home in the middle of the night.

11
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.830
I walk around.

12
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.110
Are you seeing anyone?

13
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.790
No.

14
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.950
- Is it Antoine?
- No.


15
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.910
You can't stay alone all your life.

16
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.590
Solitude is awful.

17
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.110
I'm getting married in September.

18
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.950
Who to?

19
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.710
Pierre Coubin.

20
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.910
You love him?

21
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.630
I don't know.

22
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.390
I don't really know him. I mean,

23
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.950
I've known him all my life, but I
don't know if he'll make a good husband.


24
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.630
He seems nice.

25
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.030
He's ambitious, he wants
to go live in Limoges.


26
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.590
Oh, yeah, very ambitious.

27
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.270
Do you want to
stay here all your life?

28
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.230
Yeah.

29
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.750
I like everything here.

30
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.270
We need to move on, Delphine.

31
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.870
We're not kids anymore.

32
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.070
What happened between
us doesn't matter to you?


33
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.190
It does.

34
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.310
Of course it does, but,

35
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.070
it wasn't serious.

36
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.950
- Hey.
- Hey.


37
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.630
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing, just walking.


38
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.270
You?

39
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.070
- You want it?
- No, thanks.


40
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.550
You'll get caught someday.

41
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.510
Will you go to the dance in Aubusson?

42
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.190
Dunno.

43
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.910
We could go together.

44
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.710
I don't know, Antoine.

45
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.310
We'll see.

46
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.110
Where's Delphine?

47
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.550
I don't know.

48
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.310
Delphine.

49
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.430
Delphine?

50
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.270
Delphine?!

51
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.510
PARIS SPRING 1971

52
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.150
The President welcomed, this
morning at the Élysée Palace,


53
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.270
11 mothers, with at
least 10 children each.


54
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.390
Mr. Pompidou awarded them the
Medal of the French Family.


55
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.030
And during an improvised speech, the
president spoke about the role of family.


56
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.550
"Raising kids is a lot of
work but it's rewarding."


57
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.990
"The notion of family is
threatened by the current climate."


58
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.470
"A climate emphasized by the
violence spreading everywhere."


59
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.550
"France can't become a dictatorship,

60
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.150
but the government must
act to stop this violence."


61
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.750
Hey!

62
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.150
- Hey, you're having fun?
- Yeah, it's your time for once!


63
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.710
- You're laughing now?
- Leave her alone!


64
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.230
Tarts!

65
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.710
Close the door!

66
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.870
Sluts!

67
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.390
Go fuck yourself!

68
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.750
You see how he acted?

69
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.110
If we had stolen his
wallet, he'd run the same.


70
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.470
We did worse than steal his
wallet. We stole his virility.


71
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.310
Thank god you were here.

72
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.230
- You don't scare easily!
- He was threatening.


73
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.150
- He wasn't that dangerous.
- Really?


74
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.270
He was crazy.

75
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.710
Was it a dare?

76
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.550
No, it was to
show them how it feels.

77
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.350
When it's our arse it's normal, when
it's theirs, they don't like it so much.


78
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.110
- Next time we do it to cops!
- Yeah!


79
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.670
What do you demonstrate for?

80
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.910
Women's rights.

81
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.870
The right to not be bothered
in the street for starters.


82
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.510
The right to do what we want, when we
want it, and with whoever we want to.


83
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.630
Don't you agree?

84
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.030
I don't know.

85
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.390
You don't feel like there
are things you can't do


86
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.710
because you're a woman?

87
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.830
I'm looking for a meeting, but
I don't really know about what.


88
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.590
All I know is that there's
women, and it's on Thursdays.


89
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.030
Oh, the hotheads? It's in the
lecture theater on the right.


90
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.630
You're being sectarian!
Our strength is to blend.


91
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.110
What men need to understand

92
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.910
is that for now, they don't belong here!

93
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.350
And I know what people'll say.

94
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.590
They'll say we're against men.

95
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.870
But we're not. We're not!

96
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.990
Besides, half the women
here are involved with a guy.


97
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.510
We're not against men,

98
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.870
we're for the women! For us!

99
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.190
I'm sorry,

100
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.230
I'm sorry but when there's a guy
around, a woman's attitude changes.


101
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.550
Her speech is different.
And even an educated woman,


102
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.190
when she's around a man,
whether she knows him or not,


103
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.270
she censors her speech and her thoughts.

104
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.670
What we want right now, is
to get back our free speech


105
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.550
without caring what the boyfriend,
boss or dad will think of it,


106
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.190
and talk between women.

107
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.910
OK, I agree with the separatism,

108
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.030
but in this case, there's a journalist
who wants to attend our meeting...


109
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.470
Down with the straight journalism!

110
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.590
Let everyone talk!

111
00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.870
If even within Women's Lib
we can't agree, we're doomed!


112
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.710

I really didn't envision you
sitting at a desk all day long.


127
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.590
I envisionned you...

128
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.950
doing something more physical.

129
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.590
Oh yeah? Like what?

130
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.510
Swimming teacher.

131
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.310
Yeah, you'd be good at that.

132
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.670
You need to be serious,
focused, and it's physical.


133
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.870
- And what do you do?
- Guess.


134
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.230
It's too difficult, 
I barely know you.

135
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.150
You have two attempts,
then you'll have a forfeit.


136
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.750
Saleswoman?

137
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.710
No, I'm not a saleswoman.

138
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.550
Last attempt.

139
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.110
Um... doctor?

140
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.910
Why do you think that?

141
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.750
Well, you speak well, so

142
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.110
it means you studied,

143
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.990
and you seem to care about others.

144
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.790
- Forget it, it's stupid.
- No, not at all.


145
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.590
I'm a teacher.

146
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.390
Spanish teacher.

147
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.590
So, what's the forfeit?

148
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.550
You must come to the
next meeting Thursday.


149
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.550
Ah.

150
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.870
It's a strong sentence,
but we have to compromise.


151
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.550
We're talking about people who
never speak about themselves.


152
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.030
There's no union for prisoners,

153
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.350
so if we don't represent them

154
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.070
there's no point.

155
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.190
You know how feeble
bourgeois journalists are.


156
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.230
Le Monde won't accept it.

157
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.630
If we don't stir up a hornets' nest...

158
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.830
How many articles about
French prisons are there?


159
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.350
- Zero.
- We'll be the first ones,


160
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.390
and it'll be shot down. It's stupid.

161
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.710
We're not gonna censure
ourselves until Fauvert does it.


162
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.550
What's our goal here? To publish a good
article, or to be published in Le Monde?


163
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.790
Being published in Le Monde
would gives it importance.


164
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.070
We have something to say, we worked for
a year, and in order to be published,


165
00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.950
we're gonna write what they want to read?

166
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.790
If it's just a reported speech,
it's pointless. It's demagogic!


167
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.070
Demagogic? Really?

168
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.430
Of course it is.

169
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.750
Prison creates new criminals.
That's what we think.


170
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.630
Can you take my blue dress too?

171
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.150
Put it aside though, so I don't have
to search for hours in your mess.


172
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.190
I know, I need to clean up.

173
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.510
- I don't have enough time.
- Oh, yeah, it's hard to do everything,


174
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.990
free your sisters from the male
superiority and clean your clothes.


175
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.230
Yeah.

176
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.830
What would I do without you?

177
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.350
Women can't live without men.

178
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.990
Chauvinist.

179
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.830
- Shrew.
- Boor.


180
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.230
- Virago.
- Supporter of slavery.


181
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.830
Suffragette.

182
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.030
- Pompidou's voter.
- Ah, no, no.


183
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.630
- No names!
- You didn't answer so you lost.


184
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.590
No, no, no, you're
cheating. You're cheating!


185
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.950
- A punishment for you!
- Go ahead.


186
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.470
I won, I won.

187
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.710
Hey.

188
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.470
Delphine, you're here.

189
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.670
You missed a lot.

190
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.150
We laughed so much at Ménie Grégoire.

191
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.830
Everyone went on the set.
People were screaming,


192
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.670
- "Liberty! Liberty!"
- Ah, Delphine.


193
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:30.990
Hey.

194
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.390
- How are you?
- I'm good, you?


195
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.150
I'm telling her about Ménie Grégoire.

196
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.430
Oh la la, it was something!

197
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.550
I thought she'd faint.

198
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.830
Wanna try?

199
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.990
The magazine really
doesn't stick its neck out.


200
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.590
They say: "The 343 sluts:

201
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.750
it's either courage or exhibitionism."

202
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.390
Of course. Like their
article is courageous.


203
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.190
It's OK.

204
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.750
- Sorry.
- It's OK. It's OK.


205
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.790
"We're calling on our sisters:

206
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.390
Let's demand, hand in
hand, appropriate wages,


207
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.830
on par with the work
produced, and equal to men;


208
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.790
that women stop being treated as objects.

209
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.230
Meeting in Amphitheater B, April 23."

210
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.830
How are we doing with the banners?

211
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.550
On the fourth.

212
00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.350
We need more, right?

213
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.390
- Maybe one.
- Yeah, it'll be better.


214
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.150
♪ This is the final orgasm ♪

215
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.870

- You OK?
- Yeah.


219
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.390
You're on the pill?

220
00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.950
No.

221
00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.670
Why? Are you crazy?

222
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.950
You have to. I keep
saying so to my students.


223
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.310
Discreetly though, I
don't want to get fired.


224
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.670
Why don't you take it? You
think it's too expensive?


225
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.430
- No, that's not it.
- My duty as a doctor,


226
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.830
is to do everything possible
to help a human life.


227
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.470
Whoever he is,

228
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.310
regardless of race,

229
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.710
sex, religion... and if we
don't make any distinction


230
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.590
based on race, religion or sex,

231
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.790
why should we make one based on age?

232
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.310
What if one day
we say that our seniors

233
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.870
aren't humans, so we can simply kill them.

234
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.030
No, no. Medicine isn't
on the side of death.


235
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.190
It's on the side of life.

236
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.070
So when women have the
chance to be with child,


237
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.310
but still want to abort,

238
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.950
I want to tell them:

239
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.110
"Be responsible. 
When you drive a car,

240
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.790
you respect the traffic laws.

241
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.470
Well, pregnant women and
their little passenger,


242
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.110
it's life. It's a child to be born."

243
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.270
- My body is not a car!
- Here, a human life!


244
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.670
What's going on?

245
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.990
- Enough!
- Your mother should have done


246
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.230
- everyone a favor and abort!
- Asshole!


247
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.030
Fascist!

248
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.030
Stick it!

249
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.110
What are you doing?

250
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.830
Hurry up!

251
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.150
- For a free abortion law.
- Just don't fuck.


252
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.990
- You didn't fuck?
- Of course, but I was careful.


253
00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.630
- How?
- We managed.


254
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.270
"Dear Antoine. Paris really
is an incredible city."


255
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.790
"Even though I hadn't realized it
before. Every day is different."


256
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.310
So much is happening here.

257
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.510
"I met a great girl."

258
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.310
"A great girl."

259
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.870
"An amazing girl."

260
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.070
"A fantastic girl."

261
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.430
"Her name's Carole."

262
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.630
Sorry, I probably got the wrong door.

263
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.190
- You're here for the meeting?
- Yes.


264
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.550
It's the right door. Come in.

265
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.030
- Get out!
- I'm being kicked out of my own place now.


266
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.470
We don't need you anymore.

267
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.430
- See ya.
- See ya.


268
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.430
- You good?
- Yeah.


269
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.190
- Isn't this Carole's?
- It is.


270
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.070
Carole and Manuel's. The boudoir.

271
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.030
He's not crazy at all. He is
a specialist in literature,


272
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.830
he is super smart, very funny.

273
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.270
But he's queer. 
So his fucking parents

274
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.830
put him in a mental institution
to cure him. Long live family.


275
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.510
Adeline, for us it's a no,

276
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.390
we don't deal with such cases, that's all.

277
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.190
We have to stay on point:
abortion, contraception,


278
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.990
otherwise we're gonna divide ourselves.

279
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.910
So I should leave my best friend there

280
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.750
enduring electroshocks,
and maybe a lobotomy,


281
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.310
just because it's not what we
fight for, and it's too far away?


282
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.070
That's not what we said.

283
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.950
Wait, it's legal to do that to someone?

284
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.990
Yes it's legal, and that's the problem.

285
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.390
Put a queer in a mental
institution is legal.


286
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.830
So, what's your plan?

287
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.430
My plan's easy. We go
there and we grab him.


288
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.470
I'm sorry, Adeline, but it's not our
business to handle men's problems.


289
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.710
We're not gonna start messing
with minority groups' struggles.


290
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.190
Minority? You've got a nerve to say that.

291
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.230
I fight for the pill, but it's not my
girlfriend's who's gonna knock me up.


292
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.550
- I'm really disappointed in you guys.
- Don't take it personally.


293
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.950
We pick the fights, we have to be
coherent. We can't disperse like that.


294
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.390
It doesn't have to be done
under the Women's Lib's flag.


295
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.670
- Obviously.
- Well, that's it then.


296
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.790
I don't get it. Adeline is
always the first to support you,


297
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.590
she always sticks with you no matter what,

298
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.070
she was there for Chambart, and
you can't even be there for her?


299
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.390
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

300
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.070
It's her best friend, seriously.

301
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.310
- Carole, come on, you're coming?
- I don't know.


302
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.590
What? Do you need your
boyfriend's approval?


303
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.550
What's up with you?

304
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.790
- You don't go, but I will.
- It's stupid.


305
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.710
One group goes to Plessis
-Robinson,

306
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.390
the other one goes to grab your friend.

307
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.590
Why did you change your mind?

308
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.470
I'm going to be there for my friend.

309
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.910
That's a very good reason.

310
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.830
So, you go this way.

311
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.230
- And the second right...
- On the map, we're there.


312
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.110
But I was thinking about
taking this blue path.


313
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.230
- No, you can't. That's a stream.
- Ah.


314
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.190
Maybe if you row, but
otherwise, I don't think so.


315
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.910
I'm sorry, my husband always
says I can't read a map.


316
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.350
- Yes.
- We're gonna make it.


317
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.310
We're here, and the castle's there.

318
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.990
- No, madam, look.
- Where are we? We're here, right?


319
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:07.670
Not at all, Mrs.

320
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.790
Give me your hand.

321
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.950
Hey!

322
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.830
- Stop!
- Go, go, go!


323
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.190
Where are you going?

324
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.150
I can't open my eyes anymore.

325
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.910
- Hello, auntie.
- Hello, sweetie.


326
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.550
- Are you OK?
- Yes.


327
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.550
- I'm happy to see you.
- Me too.


328
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.310
- This is my aunt: Hélène.
- Hello, ma'am.


329
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.070
- What's going on?
- Just a little accident.


330
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.470
Nothing serious.

331
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.110
- Are you sure?
- We made a crazy turn.


332
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.030
- You want anything to drink?
- Oh, yes, please, good idea.


333
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.310
You OK, Guitou?

334
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.790
He's coming back.

335
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.430
Here we are.

336
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.510
Here.

337
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.110
I've never been in the south before.

338
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.750
It's weird.

339
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.870
Don't drag too much.

340
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.350
No, not that, the landscape.

341
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.750
It's different back home.

342
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.390
It always feels like the soil is drenched.

343
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.430
Here when you walk,

344
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.430
the soil is hard.

345
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.950
Your foot bounces back,
it gives you momentum.


346
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.950
Back home, even in the summer,

347
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.550
your foot sinks in.

348
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.510
As if the soil
was going to swallow it.

349
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.630
As if you have
to fight just to walk.

350
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.430
You know what I mean?

351
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.870
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

352
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.510
We're out of sleeping bags.

353
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.710
I never fought with a man,

354
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.710
it's always with women back at the dojo.

355
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.030
Cheers.

356
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.150
In the country, it's
like an unwritten law.


357
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:21.470
- Here, taste this.
- Thank you.


358
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.470
For example, my mother
doesn't have a salary,


359
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.910
no social security, no checkbook.

360
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.950
But she works all day long.

361
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.750
And when a decision must
be made about the farm,


362
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.070
- she doesn't have a say.
- It's crazy.


363
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.790
Shift your weight back, push him forward,

364
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.110
you pin him and you do an armlock.

365
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.110
- Oh.
- Do that really fast.


366
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.750
If you do that, he can't move.

367
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.310
Why didn't you say something
during the meetings?


368
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.350
I thought no one would be
interested to hear about it.


369
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.710
Are you kidding? Everyone would
have loved to hear about it.


370
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.070
That's exactly against such
things we're fighting for.


371
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.790
- Adeline.
- No, wait, wait.


372
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.270
- I'm embarrassed.
- Why?


373
00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.630
Thanks.

374
00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.310
I don't want to talk about
it in front of everyone.


375
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.950
Can I sleep in your bed?

376
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.310
Adeline snores like a trooper.

377
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.750
Sure.

378
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.430
Thanks.

379
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.070
What?

380
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.870
The situation at the farm can't
keep going. You need to take it back.


381
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.430
You need to do

382
00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.150
a farmers collective or
something. Something unique.


383
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.110
- Did you smoke again?
- Barely.


384
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.590
What?

385
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:59.150
I never said I wanted to
kick my dad out of the farm.


386
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.670
You're a chicken.

387
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.750
- No.
- Yes, like most women.


388
00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.590
Men still have a bright future.

389
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.590
What are you doing?

390
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.590
Go away, Carole. 
Go sleep elsewhere.

391
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.150
It's OK, it's no big deal.

392
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.070
- We drank too much.
- No, you drank too much.


393
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.710
Go away, Carole!

394
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.230
"I was sixteen and a half.

395
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.630
I was in a coed high school.

396
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.270
I was sick, and I didn't have
my period, so a friend told me:


397
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.190
'You're pregnant.' She gave me
the address of a doctor in Pigalle.


398
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.590
The first time I went to see him,
he was on a first name basis with me.


399
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:31.750
He told me, 'You're one month pregnant.'

400
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.830
I was panicked and completely disoriented.

401
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.350
He asked me: 'What are you
gonna do?' I had no idea.


402
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:38.950
I didn't want to get married.

403
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.030
I didn't have a boyfriend.
The father was in La Rochelle,


404
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.110
I had no way to reach him... "

405
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.550
Hello.

406
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.270
Hey.

407
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.470
You weren't at the meeting yesterday.

408
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.910
No, I didn't feel like it.

409
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.230
Look, I wanted to tell
you about last time,


410
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.070
I'm not shocked, not at all.

411
00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:17.390
I...

412
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.550
I was just taken aback.

413
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:21.230
But...

414
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.670
I mean...

415
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.830
I have lesbian friends,

416
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.070
but I'm not, that's all.

417
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:29.550
Me neither.

418
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.990
I'm taking the banners.

419
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.270
- Well, you're pretty late.
- Yeah, yeah, don't tell me off.


420
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:57.230
I don't. Take the banners instead.

421
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:58.870
You OK?

422
00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.070
Yeah, I'm fine.

423
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.110
We can make the first trip.

424
00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.510
Put everything in the car.

425
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:25.910
We need to be first in the rally.

426
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.750
Who's taking that?

427
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:49.190
Delphine.

428
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.310
Let's go to your place.

429
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.230
What the hell are you talking about?

430
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.430
Is it to prove to yourself
you're a free woman?


431
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:32.910
I'm not trying to prove anything.

432
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.390
I didn't wake up one morning thinking

433
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:37.390
"Oh, today I'm sleeping with a girl."

434
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:38.790
It happened, that's all.

435
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.470
I thought it'd only be a one-time thing.

436
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:47.830
- But it's lasting, and...
- What? You want to break up?


437
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.190
No, otherwise I wouldn't
tell you about it.


438
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.590
Is it just a sex
thing or are you in love?

439
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.430
I don't know, Manuel.

440
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:00.110
I don't know.

441
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.430
Are you seeing her today?

442
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:36.710
I don't know.

443
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.670
You're lying.

444
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.190
I know you.

445
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.990
You dislike lying so much, when
you have, you become all yellow.


446
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.950
I swear.

447
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.110
It's not a sure thing, but
we might see each other.


448
00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:52.950
OK.

449
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.110
Find a place to spend the night then.

450
00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.710
You're not coming in our
bed after you fucked her.


451
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:50.590
No!

452
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.790
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

453
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:01.790
Bad girl.

454
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.310
Shh.

455
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.750
Oh, come on.

456
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.070
Down with the bourgeoise society!

457
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.790
Te quiero.

458
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.070
- Te quiero.
- Te quiero?


459
00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.270
Mi amor.

460
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.310
Mi amor.

461
00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:43.310
Me gustan tus pechos.

462
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.750
- What does it mean?
- Repeat it.


463
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.870
- Me gustan...
- Tus pechos.


464
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.630
- Tus pechos.
- Good.


465
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.510
Me gustan... what does it mean.

466
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.030
Nothing.

467
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.830
- That's the "pechos"?
- Yes!


468
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.590
Ah, the pechos. Yeah,
me gustan tus pechos.


469
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.470
You've got it, my love!

470
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.310
Hey.

471
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.870
Hello. Miss Vinatier?

472
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.510
- Yes.
- I have a telegram for you.


473
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.030
I don't get it.

474
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.950
If he was tired, why didn't he stop?

475
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.870
He didn't look tired, he was like usual.

476
00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.710
I didn't see it coming.

477
00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.630
Just the day before,
he was running around.


478
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.510
You know how he is.

479
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:09.750
Then, yesterday morning,
he was loading some cans,


480
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.390
and I saw him fall on the ground.

481
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.150
The doctors told me,

482
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.030
there's no warning signs
for that type of thing.


483
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.070
We're lucky he's still here.

484
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.790
Does it look like we're lucky?

485
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.870
It's hard for me too.

486
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.670
I...

487
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.870
I thought about it, and
I don't have a choice.


488
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.630
I don't have a brother,

489
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.390
an uncle or a cousin. If I
don't do it, no one else will.


490
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.750
Are you crazy? You can't cut
yourself off again out there.


491
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:58.270
It's too much for my mom!

492
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:01.670
And we can't afford a farm hand.

493
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.670
We're just starting something you and I...

494
00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:10.310
You can't tell me that over the phone
like that, Delphine. We need to meet.


495
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.750
I'm on my way. 
Where are you?

496
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.190
Not now, Carole.

497
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.430
It's OK.

498
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.430
I'm sure she's gonna come back.

499
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.550
She loves you, it's obvious.

500
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.070
What's going on?

501
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.230
I waited here, because
she's not feeling well.


502
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.470
Did you know the Liéjard brothers
are ready to buy your farm?


503
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.350
Your father had been at the
hospital for less than a day,


504
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.270
and they were already talking
about it to your mother.


505
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.750
Bunch of jerks.

506
00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.590
She didn't even tell him. 
In their dreams!

507
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:50.670
You changed.

508
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:52.950
I did?

509
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:55.230
Yeah, I don't know.

510
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.070
You look less childish, more woman.

511
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:59.430
Or maybe more Parisian.

512
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.110
That's funny. In Paris, I
always felt like a ninny,


513
00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:04.150
and you tell me I look more Parisian.

514
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.230
You know,

515
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.590
I'm really sorry about Maurice.

516
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:16.910
But I'm really happy you're here.

517
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.510
Stop going through your father's
things, he doesn't like it.


518
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:35.590
I have a meeting with the bank.

519
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.750
Why?

520
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.070
To pay the share.

521
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.430
Do you have a health insurance policy?

522
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.150
No. We're not gonna pay two of them.

523
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.630
We're not as rich as the Giscards.

524
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:51.950
Seven letters.

525
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.870
- How many letters?
- We're going to have to shell out.


526
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:15.310
Guys, regarding the purchase
of the agricultural equipment:


527
00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:18.710
we're only getting a combine harvester,

528
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.110
- every agrees?
- Yes.


529
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.990
I think it's too expensive.

530
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:25.550
We should renegotiate the price.

531
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.710
- You're getting cold feet again?
- No, I'm not!


532
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:29.590
But we're not as rich as Croesus.

533
00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.230
Once we've settled on the model we want,

534
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.070
we'll calculate everybody's share,

535
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.710
and we'll get your checks.

536
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.350
- I'll come pick everyone's check...
- Yeah, Antoine will pick them up.


537
00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:41.510
- OK for everyone?
- About Maurice, what do we do?


538
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.790
I'll pay our share.

539
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.430
So, if you pay the share,

540
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:47.350
I'll have to schedule a
bank appointment for you.


541
00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:48.910
No, that's fine. I have an
appointment early next week.


542
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.350
You took an appointment on your own?

543
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:51.950
Well, yeah.

544
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.750
It's my role as president of the
cooperative so you should have told me,


545
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.510
and we would have come with you.
You would have been more credible.


546
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.510
I thought it would be faster that way.

547
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.710
Maybe, but that's not how we do it.

548
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.070
It's not correct.

549
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.230
Well, if the appointment
is scheduled, we'll see...


550
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:09.030
- So...
- We need to appoint drivers too.


551
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.710
Your father woke up!

552
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.150
- What?
- Your father woke up!


553
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.030
They say he's still weak,

554
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.510
but he's conscious. He doesn't
speak but he can understand.


555
00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.990
Don't take that many, you're
only leaving for a few days.


556
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.550
He loves the wild boar one.

557
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.470
You know he's a big eater.

558
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.270
Ouch. We look like two
little girls running around.


559
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:05.990
Kiss him hello for me.

560
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.750
- If you have a problem, call Antoine.
- Yeah, don't worry.


561
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.070
Kiss him for me!

562
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.310
You said working the
land was non-stop work,


563
00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.310
but it feels OK to me.

564
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.590
That's because I woke up at 4:00 am
to do everything before you arrive.


565
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.270
Really? You must be exhausted.

566
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:57.910
No, I'm OK. I still have energy.

567
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.270
What kind of energy?

568
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:02.670
Come on, go, go, go!

569
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:03.870
Go, go, go!

570
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:09.830
Come on, Laura!

571
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:13.590
Stop! Stop!

572
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:14.990
Come on, Margot!

573
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:22.270
What's missing... ah, the jug of water.

574
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.430
When I was a kid, we'd play house,

575
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:00.910
and I didn't feel anything
when I kissed boys.


576
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:04.310
One day, there weren't enough
boys, so I played the dad.


577
00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:07.790
I kissed a girl and it
really made an impression.


578
00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:09.870
And then?

579
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:14.150
Then I slept with a
girl for the first time.


580
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:15.990
How old were you?

581
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:19.550
I was 16 and she was 22.

582
00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:21.550
Was she from around here?

583
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.870
No, a city girl, like you.

584
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:28.790
She was on holidays near our place.

585
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:32.070
My parents were completely
in the dark. They were happy


586
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.590
that I made friends with a
college girl, from Limoges.


587
00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:36.830
And then?

588
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:38.590
What "then"?

589
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.870
Don't make me believe there was no
one between your 16 years old and now.


590
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:46.550
I had a heartache
with a girl from here.

591
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.710
And then I met you.

592
00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:32.630
I knew it.

593
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.150
I knew it, but I couldn't
believe you'd do that.


594
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.710
You're pathetic.

595
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.110
You say you're confused,
that you don't wanna break up,


596
00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:43.910
and ten days later you go join her for
the weekend, without even warning me.


597
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.590
You must be joking.

598
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.710
Are you waiting for my approval?

599
00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:53.710
You have no self-discipline, Carole.

600
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:55.990
None.

601
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:02.070
Commitment is not just in the
amphitheater with your friends.


602
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.150
It's in your life too.

603
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:26.550
- Hello.
- Hello.


604
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:31.430
Let's get him out.

605
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:49.750
Help me.

606
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:54.470
Give me his bathrobe.

607
00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.430
Thank you.

608
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:11.710
No need to thank me.

609
00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:20.030
Are you certain of what you're doing?

610
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.590
I just left her
and I already miss her.

611
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.630
I really miss her, you know?

612
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.270
I never felt this way
before. So I'm going back,


613
00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:32.510
I don't have a choice.

614
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.990
I never wanted for you to miss me.

615
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:39.590
What I loved about you is
that you didn't need me,


616
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.670
that you were free, and strong.

617
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:44.070
So what are you saying now?

618
00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:47.750
That love, for you, is not being
able to stay apart from someone?


619
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.990
Chasing someone, tongue
rolling out, like in cartoons?


620
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.830
- That's not you, Carole.
- Maybe.


621
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:58.910
I don't know anymore,

622
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.790
I just let myself drift
away by my feelings.


623
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:02.910
I don't want to debate about this.

624
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:05.350
You don't have to stop thinking either.

625
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.430
Mom?

626
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:21.110
A friend from Paris will come visit
us for a few days, if you don't mind.


627
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:23.870
I don't. Quite the opposite actually.

628
00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.630
It's good for you, it'll
take your mind off things.


629
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.750
Between handling the farm and your
father, you deserve some entertainment.


630
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.430
Is she a colleague of yours?

631
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.710
Yeah.

632
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:42.030
She just left her boyfriend,
so she needs to take a break.


633
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:43.870
- Do they have kids?
- No.


634
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:45.630
Oh, it's easier then.

635
00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.590
She'll take Grandma's bedroom.

636
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.550
It's the most comfortable one.

637
00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.470
Oh my god!

638
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:33.110
I gotta warn you, we won't
sleep in the same room.


639
00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:34.310
Why?

640
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.150
My dad just had a heart
attack a month ago,


641
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.310
I don't want my mom
to have one as well.

642
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.670
We're gonna take it easy, OK?

643
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.350
OK.

644
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.950
Dad.

645
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:03.190
This is Carole, she came to see me.

646
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.030
Hello, sir.

647
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:08.950
Delphine told me a lot about you,

648
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:10.710
I'm really glad to meet you.

649
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:17.470
See you later.

650
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:43.430
What kind of work do
you do at Félix Potin?


651
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.670
Oh, but I don't work
at Félix Potin at all.

652
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.510
Well, I thought...

653
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.110
I'm a Spanish teacher.

654
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:50.870
We met at a women's group.

655
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:53.030
What kind of group?

656
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.710
Uh, a pottery group, just for women.

657
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:59.270
They're workshops around the material.

658
00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:03.270
We work on the feelings,

659
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.390
we sculpt, we knead.

660
00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:07.270
We work with clay.

661
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:09.870
It's pleasurable, and very relaxing.

662
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:11.430
You do that kind of thing?

663
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:13.350
Oh yeah, and she's very gifted.

664
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:16.470
She makes cute little vases, you'll see.

665
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:18.670
- Right, Delphine?
- Hmm.


666
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:26.750
Is that dessert? Can I?

667
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:29.830
- I'm gonna get you a plate.
- Oh no, don't bother.


668
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:50.710
Shh.

669
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:39.350
- Up already?
- Yeah.


670
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.510
- You didn't sleep well?
- I did, but I'm coming with you.


671
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:44.030
- We're gonna go work.
- I know.


672
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:47.910
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes.


673
00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:51.870
- Here you go.
- Thanks.


674
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:56.550
Thank you.

675
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.550
That's no work for a teacher.

676
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:37.510
Oh, am I too slow?

677
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:39.950
No, no. It's just that if I
didn't have to do it, I wouldn't.


678
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.070
Really?

679
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.190
- But you're proud of what you do?
- Proud? No.


680
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:45.470
Why would I be?

681
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:48.830
You and your daughter manage to keep
the farm running, that's not nothing.


682
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.710
It's the proof that a farm
can be managed by women.


683
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:56.110
It's true that women are
as good as men for work,


684
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:58.710
but that's not how it's done.

685
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:03.590
- What?
- Nothing.


686
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:05.630
Here.

687
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:07.550
It's easier with a man, don't you agree?

688
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.110
I didn't say anything.

689
01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:16.470
What do you have against men?

690
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.390
What?

691
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:21.790
- What?
- Nothing...


692
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.830
What you do is marvelous.

693
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:30.070
You should be proud, Monique.

694
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:39.470
Got it.

695
01:01:58.790 --> 01:01:59.870
Look.

696
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:02.830
Touch it.

697
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:31.990

I didn't even touch you yet.

714
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.150
- Did you feel it?
- No.


715
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:06.670
You see.

- And now?
- No.


717
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:03.630
- Did you tell him we made hay?
- He doesn't understand what we say.


718
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:07.470
Of course he does. Right, Dad?

719
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:10.950
We made hay.

720
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.670
We have to talk to him.
That's what keeps him alive.


721
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.710
You can bury your head in
the sand. I see what I see.


722
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:33.670
Sorry. Here.

723
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:56.950
Do it!

724
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:04.310
Come on, Delphine!

725
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.470
- To Delphine being back, and welcome to...
- Carole.


726
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.150
I'm Josette. To Carole and Delphine.

727
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:20.630
Cheers.

728
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:22.670
- So, was it good in Paris?
- Yeah.


729
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:25.310
- I did unexpected things.
- Like what?


730
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:26.670
Politics.

731
01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:28.190
Politics?

732
01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:29.990
You're gonna do a kolkhoz?

733
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:31.830
Maybe not a cooperative, but making sure

734
01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:34.430
women get a salary for the work
they do would be a great start.


735
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:36.950
I do have a salary. 
My husband's salary.

736
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.190
It's already nice that
she can dip into it, no?


737
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.550
Yes.

738
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:56.670
It seems nice.

739
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.670
Do you want a drink?

740
01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:02.190
No, thanks. I can't right now.

741
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:05.270
Well, I feel like drinking tonight.

742
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.670
It's well deserved, look.

743
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:10.190
Practice makes perfect.

744
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:12.670
How long have you known Delphine?

745
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.390
Since forever.

746
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:17.670
What was she like as a kid?

747
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.750
Like now.

748
01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:27.430
You know, you can't know
someone in just three months.


749
01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.590
Delphine won't leave.

750
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:34.670
Really?

751
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.550
How can you be certain?

752
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:39.790
Have you seen Maurice?

753
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:43.550
He'll never be able to handle the farm.

754
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:47.030
And Delphine would rather
die than sell it. I know that.

01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:16.470
I doubt I'll wake up your dad.

760
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:18.110
Hello!

761
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:20.030
Stop, please.

762
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:22.270
Sorry, we drank a little bit too much.

763
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:43.350

on our own today. I love you."


764
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:23.550
I can't figure out if Delphine
really likes this life,


765
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.910
or if she can't imagine something else.

766
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:30.710
I'm sure she could do
a ton of other things.


767
01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.550
Your daughter's smart.

768
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:35.830
But you know that.

769
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:38.830
She's an egg-head.

770
01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:48.470
You know...

771
01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:51.790
I'm not here to make hay.

772
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:54.070
Or to be on holidays in the countryside.

773
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:56.710
I don't care about the countryside at all.

774
01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:01.630
I came here because of your daughter.

775
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.630
Because I love her.

776
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:08.910
There, I said it.

777
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:12.510
I'm crazy about her.

778
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:15.790
I never thought I could
love someone like this.


779
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:25.790
I've got it.

780
01:11:14.710 --> 01:11:16.350
Delphine.

781
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:18.830
Don't you miss Paris?

782
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:22.150
No, not really.

783
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:25.710
When we met, you seemed to like it.

784
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:29.070
That's because you were there.

785
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:32.150
If you had been on Mars, I
would have liked Mars too.


786
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:34.950
You're a sweet-talker.

787
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:39.830
I didn't think one day, 
I'd miss Paris.

788
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:44.630
The smell of fumes.

789
01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:47.430
The car horns.

790
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:52.510
The coffee I drink at the
bar before going to work.


791
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.230
Sitting between a worker and a boss,

792
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:59.630
and everyone has the same
status for five minutes.


793
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:06.030
I even miss the cops.

794
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:15.110
Oh no, don't throw all
that. You're wasting it.


795
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:18.470
- Ah, really?
- Yeah, let me do it.


796
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:28.550
Hello, Monique.

797
01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:30.750
- Hello, Antoine.
- How are you?


798
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.310
- Hi.
- Hello.


799
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:38.230
If only...

800
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:40.510
she were to marry him. 
That'd be nice.

801
01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:43.750
Why do you say that?

802
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:47.790
When she left for Paris, I
thought it would never happen.


803
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:51.870
I thought Antoine would get
bored. But now that she's back...


804
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.990
I don't see what's stopping them.

805
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:56.870
Did he ask her?

806
01:12:56.870 --> 01:13:00.030
He's waiting for her.
That's his way of asking her.


807
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.790
And are you sure Delphine knows that?

808
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:07.510
Everybody knows.

809
01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:09.670
And she's got eyes.

810
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.990
Carole, what are you doing? I've
been looking for you everywhere.


811
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:36.310
Unless I'm abducted by aliens, I
can't see what could happen to me here.


812
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:38.870
Why are you pissed off?

813
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:41.950
Do you realize that your mom thinks
you're going to marry Antoine?


814
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:43.990
Do you realize that?

815
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:48.190
So what. It makes her happy.
She's allowed to dream.


816
01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.550
Yeah, right.

817
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:52.390
You keep her hoping because
it works out well for you.


818
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:55.670
What do you want me to say
to her? That we're together?


819
01:13:55.710 --> 01:13:58.510
Yeah! You can't lie
to her your whole life.

820
01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.590
Maybe she'll stop thinking I'm a Parisian

821
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:04.110
who wants to get back to nature.

822
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:08.430
I can't rush her out of nowhere. She
doesn't even know such things exist.


823
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:11.070
Oh right. Keep thinking
your mom's an idiot.


824
01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:12.670
It's convenient for you.

825
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:18.670
Carole.

826
01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:25.310
Carole.

827
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:28.870
Please, open the door.

828
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.310
Carole.

829
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:07.110
Oh, shut up.

830
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.030
No comments.

831
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:11.270
What?

832
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:16.150
What are you trying to do exactly?

833
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:18.670
Your mom asked me to set this up.

834
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:20.510
You're doing it wrong.

835
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:28.830
You're good at that.

836
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:31.670
Monique is fond of you now.

837
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:33.470
She's always asking you to do things.

838
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:35.230
Yeah, she likes me.

839
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:38.310
It's a good thing she doesn't
know all the dirty we're doing.


840
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:45.230
Carole.

841
01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:04.670
- Hello.
- Hello.


842
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:11.430
He's gonna spread rumors around:

843
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:14.350
"Maurice's daughter is
a lesbian, hide your... "


844
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:16.590
Stop, it's not funny.

845
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:21.910
Delphine.

846
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:58.790
It's stuck.

847
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:02.830
I can't put my hand in it.

848
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:04.710
Ah, that's it, I got it.

849
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.470
He's coming, he's coming!

850
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:12.950
Yes! Yes, come on!

851
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:15.990
- Come on, girl!
- Keep going!


852
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:17.670
Yeah.

853
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:19.390
Yes!

854
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:25.590
Here you go. Your baby.

855
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:38.350
You scared us, girl.

856
01:18:38.710 --> 01:18:40.630
It was off to a bad start.

857
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:42.630
Thanks, Antoine.

858
01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:01.630
- A coffee, Antoine?
- Yes, please.


859
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.910
- Coffee?
- Yeah.


860
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.870
I can't stand it. 
I'm going home.

861
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:43.350
Whatever.

862
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.110
Go back to Manuel too.

863
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.910
I left him for you, remember?

864
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:50.870
Did you ever wonder if
that wouldn't bother me?


865
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:53.030
- You turning up like this?
- What?


866
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:55.910
What was I going to tell my folks,
I'm just supposed to be out and proud?


867
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:58.750
That's small.

868
01:19:59.230 --> 01:20:01.070
That's very small of you.

869
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:04.750
I'm not like you. I do
care what people think.


870
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:13.750
Say you're ashamed of
me while you're at it!


871
01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:19.110
Shit, I...

872
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:22.750
I kept my mouth shut, I
said yes to everything...


873
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:29.830
It's not other people who look at
you. You're monitoring yourself.


874
01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:32.150
You're your own guardian.

875
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:34.950
- Your own guardian!
- I can't do everything at once!


876
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.870
I can't manage the
farm and be with you!

877
01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:42.910
You keep saying women must be independent.

878
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:45.430
Well, I fight everyday
so that this farm exists.


879
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:49.390
- That's concrete!
- Yeah, great! Congrats!


880
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:51.110
You're a pioneer, good for you!

881
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:52.830
Great!

882
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:56.670
You fight more for
your farm than for us!

883
01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:03.790
You're heartless, Delphine.

884
01:21:04.670 --> 01:21:06.990
All I sacrificed for you!

885
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:10.990
Don't you get it?

886
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:14.630
I'm here for you!

887
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:47.230
Delphine, you found your place?

888
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:48.990
Yeah.

889
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:52.830
- You good?
- Yeah, you?


890
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:54.830
Have you seen it?

891
01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:51.150
Where were you? 
We didn't even toast.

892
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.750
It's a nice machine.

893
01:22:54.190 --> 01:22:55.790
Yeah, it's nice.

894
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:58.950
Kiss me.

895
01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:00.750
- What?
- Kiss me.


896
01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:05.630
Why do you do that?

897
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:07.430
You have a finger in every pie?

898
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:08.550
What?

899
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.910
I saw you with your girl friend.
I know why she's here.


900
01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:13.030
What do you mean, what did you see?

901
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.310
Don't take me for a fool,
it's even worse!


902
01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:17.390
Stop.

903
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:27.430
Antoine.

904
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:30.710
- Antoine.
- What game are you playing? Huh?


905
01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:32.270
What do you want?

906
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:34.470
You want me to cover for you?

907
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:41.110
I won't say a word.

908
01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:43.910
Don't worry about that.
You mean too much for me.


909
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:55.070
It took you a
while to see that machine.

910
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:07.790
You better?

911
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:11.270
- Uh?
- Yeah.


912
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:17.710
My little cowboy.

913
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:33.310
It's gonna be OK. 
It's gonna be OK.

914
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:35.510
It's OK.

915
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:37.470
Shh.

916
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:47.990
Delphine.

917
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:50.630
Delphine.

918
01:24:58.510 --> 01:24:59.910
07:30 am.

919
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:05.270
- Fuck.
- Well, now she knows.


920
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:07.150
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

921
01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:10.750
It's not happening. Fuck!

922
01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:22.270
Don't fucking laugh!

923
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:51.470
You weren't awake, so I did the milking.

924
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:55.390
Thanks.

925
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:58.910
I forgot the alarm clock.
It won't happen tomorrow.


926
01:25:59.510 --> 01:26:01.150
I hope.

927
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:38.630
I'm sorry.

928
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:45.310
- I'm gonna go to the market.
- OK.


929
01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:47.950
That gives you two hours to leave.

930
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:51.910
When I'm back, it has to be
as if you were never here.


931
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:56.430
- You think Delphine will be OK with this?
- This is my house!


932
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:59.790
So I want you
to get out, to leave.

933
01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:01.910
- Let's talk about this.
- No.


934
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:04.950
My daughter's sane. 
She's a good girl.

935
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:07.150
You damaged her. You're...

936
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:09.910
You're nasty.

937
01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:11.950
I'm the same person

938
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:14.510
you've been working with
all these weeks, Monique.


939
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:17.430
You didn't think I was nasty back then.

940
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:19.790
Because I didn't know! You're a liar

941
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:22.350
- on top of being a pervert!
- Yes, we lied to you.


942
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:24.590
But Delphine was afraid to hurt you.

943
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:26.430
And I agreed to
lie, because I love her.

944
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:28.190
Shut up!

945
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:30.350
Shut up. What are you gonna do now?

946
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:32.510
You're gonna tell me
the nasty things you did?


947
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:35.150
All the disgusting
things? I don't wanna know!


948
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:38.630
It's not disgusting! I'm
talking about your daughter!


949
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:41.670
Get out! You're the devil in my house!

950
01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:43.270
Stop! Stop it!

951
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:47.110
- The devil in my house.
- Stop, Monique.


952
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:57.870
Delphine!

953
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:04.310
Delphine! I'm leaving!

954
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:06.310
I'm catching a train, 
I can't stay here.

955
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:08.190
I can't...

956
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:11.390
She threw me out!

957
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:16.110
Carole.

958
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:21.310
If you leave, I leave.

959
01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:25.150
I'm coming with you,
Carole. I'm coming with you!


960
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:46.270
"Mom, I'm leaving with Carole."

961
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:50.190
"I was too afraid to tell you about
myself, but I hope one day you'll get it."


962
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:52.310
"Forgive me for hurting you."

963
01:28:54.190 --> 01:28:56.430
"You and Dad will
always be in my heart."

964
01:28:57.990 --> 01:29:00.590
"I'm still your daughter. Delphine."

965
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:14.270
Adeline won't believe it.

966
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:17.510
I'll grab my things,
and we'll find a place.


967
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:42.710
The connection is in 45 minutes.

968
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:44.950
There's not even a café around.

969
01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:47.350
I'm so hungry.

970
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:49.830
When we arrive, I'll take
you to the restaurant.


971
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:51.590
A great one.

972
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:56.150
You're not hungry?

973
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:57.670
Not really.

974
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:21.670
Carole, I can't.

975
01:30:21.670 --> 01:30:22.910
What?

976
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:25.270
I don't want to
hurt you, but I can't.

977
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:30.950
That's not possible. You can't
change your mind like this...


978
01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:34.190
in an hour, for something this important.

979
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:37.430
I can't do it. I can't.

980
01:30:43.630 --> 01:30:45.430
Come with me, I'm begging you.

981
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:48.150
Delphine.

982
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:51.550
What was the chance for us to meet?

983
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:52.950
One in a million?

984
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:56.590
One in two millions? We were at
the same place at the same time.


985
01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:59.510
If you have gotten in the bus five minutes
earlier, you would have never seen me.


986
01:30:59.510 --> 01:31:02.510
We would have never met. It's a sign!

987
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:05.430
I do believe in signs!

988
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:09.350
Let's catch this train.

989
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:15.990
- Carole.
- We have to go.


990
01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:17.790
Train's coming.

991
01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:20.190
Let's go. Take your suitcase.

992
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:25.910
Come on.

993
01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:28.230
Delphine!

994
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:09.510
You missed your train?

995
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:14.190
No, I came back.

996
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:17.030
I'm here.

997
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:22.510
You're back?

998
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:31.110
And the other one?

999
01:33:32.630 --> 01:33:34.630
Carole is back in Paris, she won't return.

1000
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:08.350
Do your parents know?

1001
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:13.110
- Are you afraid?
- No.


1002
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:25.190
Is it gonna hurt?

1003
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:27.550
No, don't worry.

1004
01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:30.950
The doctor is going to
do a suction aspiration.


1005
01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:33.190
It's a simple,

1006
01:34:33.230 --> 01:34:35.630
less risky, and painless abortion.

1007
01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:39.630
You're three weeks, so you
came here at the right time.


1008
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:42.190
Is everything clear to you?

1009
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:44.110
Yes, I think. Thanks.

1010
01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:48.510
Now, did you ever think
about going on the pill?


1011
01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:49.990
I don't know.

1012
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:52.230
Take a pill every day...

1013
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:55.870
we don't really know what
it does, how it works.


1014
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:57.830
I can explain to you how it works,

1015
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:59.830
that way you'll stop imagining things.

1016
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:02.750
Are you on the pill?

1017
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:05.030
No, I'm not.

1018
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:07.150
Why don't you if it's that good?

1019
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:11.230
I don't take the pill because
I don't need contraception.


1020
01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:15.430
I'm with a woman.

1021
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:17.910
You remember Coralie,

1022
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:19.990
- we saw her three weeks ago?
- Mm-hm.


1023
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:21.830
- She's staying at my place.
- Ugh.


1024
01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:23.750
Don't "Ugh" me.

1025
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:28.630
She had nowhere to go, and I didn't
want to send her to some shelter.


1026
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:30.030
Sigrid.

1027
01:35:30.190 --> 01:35:31.750
You're too nice.

1028
01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:33.550
It's a quality too.

1029
01:35:34.110 --> 01:35:36.350
One day, you'll let
people walk all over you.


1030
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:38.710
It's only the third time.

1031
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:42.150
But the timing's good, I
was starting to feel lonely.


1032
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:44.230
You OK?

1033
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:47.270
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1034
01:35:47.670 --> 01:35:49.110
Excuse me a minute.

1035
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:58.190
"Dear Carole,

1036
01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:02.270
I hope you get this letter.

1037
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:05.710
I wanted to tell you that
I left my parents' farm.


1038
01:36:06.190 --> 01:36:08.590
What I couldn't do when
you were there by my side,


1039
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:10.750
I did it a few years later.

1040
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:13.110
I thought about you a lot.

1041
01:36:13.190 --> 01:36:15.310
I follow the movement's news.

1042
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:17.710
I still can't believe
everything you achieved.


1043
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:20.230
Now I wonder what cause you're fighting,

1044
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.470
who you're living with, what you became.

1045
01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:25.430
I live in the south now.
I've got my own farm.


1046
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:27.510
It's small but it's mine.

1047
01:36:28.990 --> 01:36:30.870
I wish I could go back in time.

1048
01:36:31.230 --> 01:36:33.110
Go back to that day on the train,

1049
01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:36.870
and have the courage I
lacked back then, but...


1050
01:36:38.230 --> 01:36:39.830
that's not possible.

1051
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:42.990
I cried a lot after you left.

1052
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:45.670
But at least, I understand that

1053
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:47.750
we can't go back.

1054
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:49.790
We can only move forward.

1055
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:52.190
That's what I'm trying to do now.

1056
01:36:59.950 --> 01:37:01.270
Love.

1057
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:02.710
Delphine."
