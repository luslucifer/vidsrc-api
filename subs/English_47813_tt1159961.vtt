[SINGING]

13
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.010
HAHN: It was the spring of 1994
and we were just finishing The Lion King,


14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.690
which would go on
to earn great reviews


15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.570
and about three-quarters
of a billion dollars at the box office.


16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.530
Not bad for a group of artists
who were kicked off the Disney lot


17
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.490
and an art form that was given up for dead
just ten years earlier.


18
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.210
HAHN:
I produced The Lion King


19
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.930
and the cast-and-crew premiere
was coming up fast.


20
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.010
It was tradition for all of us
to get up on-stage


21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.770
and give warm thank-you speeches.

22
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.690
But this time
I decided to film all the speeches instead.


23

HAHN: Whenever you're comfortable.
- You are rolling?


24
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.890
HAHN: Yeah.
- Okay.


25
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.570
With all the many varied businesses
this company is in, it is clear--


26
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.250
It becomes clearer every day
that animation is its soul, heart,


27
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.890
and most of its body parts.

28
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.370
You guys have done an unbelievable job
over the last decade,


29
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.650
culminating in Lion King,

30
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.410
in pushing forward the company,
the culture and the quality of artistry.

HAHN:
Let's back up to the early '80s


48
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.530
on the Disney Studio lot
in Burbank, California.


49
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.610
The animation band is spreading
its holiday cheer to the employees


50
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.370
with banjos and jew's harps,
as was the tradition.


51
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.490
And that's me on the right,
trying to play "Jingle Bells" on the bass.


52
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.490
Like so many of us,
I grew up on a diet of Disney films.


53
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.370
And every four years,
I'd make a pilgrimage


54
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.130
to the drive-in theater
to see their latest animated masterpiece.


55
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.130
When I was 20, 
I got a job at the studio

56
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.650
delivering artwork and coffee
to the animators


57
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.810

HAHN:
This was the house that Walt built.


59
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.290
Walt Disney, the toast of Hollywood,
the genius behind Disneyland


60
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.890
and the producer behind the first
animated feature, Snow White.


61
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.890
By the 1950s,
Walt was losing interest in animation


62
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.370
and his attention turned
to live-action films,


63
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.970
the new medium of television,

64
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.410
and building the first theme park,
Disneyland,


65
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.890
and planning futuristic cities
of tomorrow.


66
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.650
WALT: By far, the most important part
of our Florida Project,


67
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.090
in fact, the heart of everything
we'll be doing in Disney World,


68
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.330
will be our Experimental Prototype City
of Tomorrow, Epcot.


69
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.370
Walt died in 1966,

70
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.970
but the studio still made sweet, harmless,
animated comedies for kids,


71
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.530
supervised by his master animators,
the Nine Old Men,


72
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.450
and produced by Walt's son-in-law,
studio head Ron Miller.

- Great way to start the film.

And we're gonna go inside
and see what it's like. Come on.


85
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.810
For some reason,
the halls of the Disney Animation building


86
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.570
always smelled faintly of swamp coolers
and pencil shavings and old linoleum.


87
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.730
This is the infamous Rat's Nest.

88
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.090
Animation had been in
this slow downward spiral for a long time,


89
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.130
even since Walt Disney was alive.

90
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.810
As veteran animators retired, new kids,

91
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.850
mostly from the Disney-sponsored school,
CalArts, filled the hallways.

Why, RubÃ©n, you're from CalArts also.

- And who are you?


94

LASSETER: Me?
- Yes.


95
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.330
LASSETER:
I'm John Lasseter.


96
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.490
He's the cameraman.
He's leaving in a little while.


97
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.530
- Could I show you animation?
- He's got six days.


98
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.010
- Could I show you animation?
- This is animation.


99
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.930
Could I flip something for you?

100
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.930
This is it. Look at that. Peter Pan.

It's better than the magic
we're making today,


103
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.530
but we can't help that.

104
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.610
We were full of a lot of pent-up youthful
creative energy that had to go somewhere,


105
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.170
so it was channeled into things
like long lunches, volleyball games,


106
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.210
the annual caricature show,

107
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.530
and my perennial favorite,
the holiday show


108
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.970
that starred Eddie Fisher and Doris Day,
for some unknown reason.

CARTWRIGHT: This is one of our
animators here. This is Ron Clements.


112
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.570
He's working on a scene of the Widow
from The Fox and the Hound.


113
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.130
- Magically, here is Mr. John-ald Musker.
- Thank you, thank you.


114
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.890
CARTWRIGHT: Another animator here
at the magic factory.


115
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.610
LASSETER: This is Glen Keane.
CARTWRIGHT: Keane.


116
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.010
LASSETER:
He is a directing animator.


117
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.490
KEANE:
I've been here since 8:00 this morning.


118
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.330
LASSETER: Hi, Tim.
CARTWRIGHT: This is Tim Burton,


119
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.090
another one of our people here.

120
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.010
Ron Miller knew that
Walt's guys were retiring fast.


121
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.210
He had to raise a new crop of animators,
but he was cautious about it.


122
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.650
He got burned five years earlier

123
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.610
when he entrusted a charismatic animator
named Don Bluth to lead the department.


124
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.890
But Bluth polarized the animators.

125
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.490
Some adored him
as the messiah of animation and others...


126
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.130
Well, others thought
he was just another Walt wannabe.


127
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.850
Ironically,
Bluth himself became disillusioned


128
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.810
with the studio's Animation Department.

129
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.690
So on his birthday in 1979,
he resigned


130
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.450
and took half the animators with him
to start his own studio.


131
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.810
The bombshell set back the release
of The Fox and the Hound by six months


132
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.130
and left Miller and the studio betrayed.

133
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.730
CLEMENTS: It was this interesting
cross-generational thing


134
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.770
where you still had a few
of these legendary Disney artists


135
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.850
who were now in their sixties
and approaching retirement


136
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.130
and then a bunch of young people
in their twenties


137
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.130
who were really, really excited
and sort of passionate about this medium.


138
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.010
It was thrilling to learn
from the masters.


139
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.170
But there was a feeling like that somehow
we could be making better films.


140
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.210
Around that time,
the studio did a survey


141
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.290
that revealed
a majority of teenage moviegoers


142
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.610
wouldn't be caught dead
near a Disney movie.


143
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.850
We were just waiting,
waiting for something, anything to happen.


144
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.410
On Monday,
we reported that Walt Disney Studios


145
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.610
was on shaky financial ground,
because of its troubled Film Division


146
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.010
and weak earnings
from the Epcot Center in Florida.


147
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.050
However, since that report,
there have been dramatic developments.


148
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.450
In just four days,
Disney stock jumped 16 percent,


149
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.810
topping off at around $58 a share.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.090
Analysts attribute the jump
to two factors.


151
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.090
Splash, the youth-oriented comedy
about a mermaid in Manhattan,


152
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.490
stunned Hollywood by racking up
over $6 million in its opening three days.


153
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.770
That's the best opening for any movie
in Disney's history.


154
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.770
Another surprise, the resignation of
Roy E. Disney as chairman of the board.


155
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.010
He's Walt's nephew and son of Walt's
brother, the company's co-founder.


156
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:14.570
The real heartbeat of this company was,
is and will always be the film business.


157
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.730
Because from the film business
comes the ideas


158
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.330
that then generate new things
in the parks.


159
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.130
New promotions, new--

160
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.170
A kind of a sense of continuing newness
about the company in general.


161
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.090
And when that began to fail--

162
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.890
And I actually, somewhere along the line,
began hearing things like,


163
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.810
"Well, I don't think they really wanna stay
in the movie business,


164
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.690
because it's not doing very well
and we don't really even need it anyway."


165
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.530
And that gave me all sorts of problems,
because I, you know--


166
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.650
I remember saying at one point,
"Well, if you really think that way,


167
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.650
then what you're doing
is running a museum."


168
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.770
SCHNEIDER: People always talked
about Roy as the idiot nephew.


169
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.210
That was his nickname.

170
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.570
Nothing could be really further
from the truth.


171
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.690
He was smart, unassuming
and powerful.


172
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.530
You could easily underestimate him,
but you did so at your own peril.


173
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.570
In 1984, the corporate raider Saul
Steinberg turned his sights on Disney.


174
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.450
He threatened to buy the company,
break it up and sell the parts for a profit.


175
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.250
The board countered by paying Steinberg
a premium to buy back his shares.


176
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.930
It was greenmail.

177
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.930
For years,
Roy and his cousin-in-law, Ron Miller,


178
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.690
sat across the boardroom table.

179
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.450
And now the two were at odds

180
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.330
with how the board was handling
the takeover threat.


181
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.490
ROY: And we finally came to the conclusion
that we can't do anything on the inside,


182
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.530
because I'm the lone voice of dissent
on this board.


183
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.690
So I resigned
from the board of directors.


184
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.530
And it got enormous amounts
of attention.


185
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.690
I had a stack the next morning
of phone messages


186
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.130
that probably was three,
four inches deep.


187
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.530
One of the messages in that stack
was Eisner.


188
00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.010
And I had known Michael

189
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.250
because he'd come maybe a year
before that on to the board at CalArts.


190
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.930
Michael wasn't an M.B.A.
He was an English major.


191
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.130
He grew up in New York,

192
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.730
where one of his first jobs
was programming kids' television for ABC.


193
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.730
SCHNEIDER: And Michael had an amazing
track record coming from Paramount.


194
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.810
He'd had hits, Oscar nominations,
Terms of Endearment.


195
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.050
He was a winner when he was hired
to come in and run Disney.


196
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.250
He also was a man
who liked to blow things up.


197
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.970
It was Frank Wells that gave Roy
the idea of making Michael the chairman.


198
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.410
Frank and Roy were classmates
at Pomona College in the early '50s.


199
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.810
ROY: I thought, you know,
Frank's more of a businessman


200
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.810
and Michael is a little nuts.

201
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:45.250
And the two together kind of in some ways
made me think of Walt and my dad.


202
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.450
So we began saying,
"How would you two like to take this job?"


203
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.690
There's been a management shake-up
in the Magic Kingdom of Disney.


204
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.250
Two Hollywood studio executives
have been chosen


205
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.090
to run Walt Disney Productions,

206
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.090
the first time outsiders
have been brought in at the top.


207
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.930
The Disney board of directors chose
Michael Eisner


208
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.490
of Paramount Pictures as chairman,

209
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.610
and Frank Wells of Warner Bros.
as chief operating officer.


210
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.850
ROY: The first goal, really,
of new management


211
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.290
is gonna be getting back
in the movie business


212
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.290
in a very serious way,

213
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.330
in the sense of not only
just making movies,


214
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.290
but coming up with new ideas.

215
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.170
Their partnership really
made the company special.


216
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.850
There was this perception that Michael
was a shoot-from-the-hip,


217
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.210
back-of-the-napkin kind of guy,

218
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.130
and Frank was very organized
and ran things in an orderly manner.


219
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.970
But in many ways, it was the opposite.
Michael was kind of the sane one.


220
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.290
And Frank, he did bold and crazy things,

221
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.130
like swimming oceans,
climbing the great summits of the world


222
00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.650
and calling at 3 a.m.
to ask what Goofy's original name was.


223
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.570
Please welcome my mountain-climbing
Disney teammate, Frank Wells.


224
00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.130
I figured out from this employee forum
what the difference is


225
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.650
between chief operating officer
and chief executive officer.


226
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.330
Chief operating officer is in charge
of doing dangerous things,


227
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.050
like when I have to fly here
with Tinker Bell on a tiny wire.


228
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.650
Chief executive officer,
he's in charge of funny.


229
00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.010
Frank?

230
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.810
Hi, Michael.

231
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.730
ROY:
I came back to the company in 1984


232
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.170
and, rather cavalier way at the time,
said to Michael,


233
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.490
"Why don't you let me
have the Animation Department,


234
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.010
because I may be the only guy right now,
with all these new people coming in,


235
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.530
who at least understands the process
and knows most of the people."


236
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.410
The state of the art at that moment
was kind of waning


237
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:30.050
and the enthusiasm of the studio itself
towards it had not been real strong.


238
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.690
So I just felt
a little protective about it.

239
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.370
MINKOFF:
And I was in John Musker's office.


240
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.050
And I think it was Steve Hulett
came in


241
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.250
with the memo saying that
Ron Miller had resigned.


242
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.250
And we were shocked
and it was a huge bombshell to go off.


243
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.210
But I thought it was,
you know, terrific news,


244
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.450
that maybe it meant that things were
gonna actually get better at the studio.


245
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.930
And John, I think, felt the same way.
He seemed pretty excited about it.


246
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.850
But Ron was worried,
in a sort of melancholy mood, said,


247
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.770
"It could always get worse."

248
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.570
It was an invasion from Hollywood.

249
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.290
The parking lot was jammed
with BMWs and Porsches.


250
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.930
And I remember interior decorators
tearing down walls


251
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.650
that hadn't been touched since 1939.

252
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.970
New Berber carpeting replaced
decades-old linoleum.


253
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.090
I couldn't figure out
what's wrong with linoleum.


254
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.290
I mean,
Walt Disney walked on that linoleum.


255
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.730
Even the snack machines
were being torn out.


256
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.810
Goodbye, vending machines.

257
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.730
KEANE: I had no experience
with Hollywood at that time.


258
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.410
My experience was with kindly old men
with cardigan sweaters.


259
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.290
And they would sit around
and pat you on the back.


260
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:37.250
And here's these guys hollering foul
language in the middle of story meetings.


261
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.050
And a splash of cold water,
suddenly a wake-up to reality.


262
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.250
You're in the real world here.

263
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.410
Hello. I'm Michael Eisner.

264
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.530
And welcome to
The Disney Sunday Movie.


265
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.410
SAWYER: Michael Eisner is the
irreverent kid from the Disney generation


266
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.490
who has taken over the toy store.

267
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.370
The money alone
is right out of Fantasyland.


268
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.770
His salary and stock options are worth
tens of millions of dollars.


269
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.130
He may look every inch
the company chairman


270
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.410
when he is taping the introduction to
The Disney Sunday Night Movie.


271
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.610
But in fact, he's having more fun
than any other boy on the block.


272
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.610
Look, Mickey.
Some of our friends are coming.


273
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.090
Hey, Minnie.

274
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.410
So one of the first things
that Michael did as CEO


275
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.290
was to bring in Jeffrey Katzenberg,
his colleague from Paramount,


276
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.090
to run the Film Division of Disney.

277
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.130
Jeffrey got his start in
New York politics,


278
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.690
working in the office of
Mayor John Lindsay,


279
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.410
where his affectionate nickname
was Squirt.


280
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.130
At Paramount Pictures,

281
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.050
he studied in the shadow of Barry Diller
and Michael Eisner.


282
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.970
And there his nickname was
the Golden Retriever.


283
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.650
At Disney, he really had no nickname,

284
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.650
because this was the place
where he could step out of the shadows


285
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.490
and make his mark on Hollywood.

286
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.010
EISNER:
I sought him out at Paramount.


287
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.450
We'd worked together.
He was just fantastic.


288
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.570
He was a worker. He was committed.
He was obsessed.


289
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.210
He made relationships.

290
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.770
If we found somebody good,
he would lasso him into our company.


291
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.010
He did it at Paramount
and he did it at Disney and he did it great.


292
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.690
KATZENBERG: So I always remember
my first day at Disney when I showed up


293
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.090
and I went to Michael's office
and he said,


294
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.810
"Come here,
I wanna show you something."


295
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.690
And I walked over
and he was looking out his window.


296
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.450
And, you know, from his corner,

297
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.850
he pointed down
to the Ink and Paint building.


298
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.890
He said,
"Do you know what they do down there?"


299
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.130
And I said, "No."

300
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.450
He said, "That's where they make
the animated movies."


301
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.570
I went, "Really?" He said, "Yes."
And he said, "And that's your problem."


302
00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.890
The first culture clash happened
on a much-anticipated film


303
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.490
that was years in the making
and millions over budget,


304
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.730
The Black Cauldron.

305
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.810
- He's overwhelmed.
- He'd be jumping up and down.


306
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.490
- Jumping, clapping.
- He'd be like:


307
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.170
The younger guys were really impatient
and anxious to show what they could do,


308
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.050
but they felt
like they were being held back


309
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.610
by the remnants of the old guard.

310
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.450
While the older guys thought the kids
were brats and should get back to work.


311
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.850
In the case of The Black Cauldron,
we started with five books


312
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.730
and had to condense them down
into one.


313
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.050
KATZENBERG: In the first couple
of weeks I was at the studio,


314
00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.610
I saw The Black Cauldron.

315
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.330
It was a very dark movie
and a very troubled movie.


316
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.770
"This is just way, way, way too violent
and too scary.


317
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.570
You have to edit
some of these things out."


318
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.770
They said,
"Well, you can't edit an animated movie."


319
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.090
I said, "Well, of course you can."
And they said, "No, you can't."


320
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.490
TARAN:
Hey. No, you don't.


321
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.890
KATZENBERG:
Honestly, you would think that


322
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.770
I was causing World War Three
at the studio,


323
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.770
because I literally said, "Well,
you get the film and bring it to an edit bay


324
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.090
and I'm gonna show you
how you edit an animated movie."


325
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.250
I mean it.

326
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.290
Jeffrey was hands-on, elbows-on,
sharp elbows-on.


327
00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.170
You never knew
if he was gonna hug you or kick you.


328
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.690
He said in an interview around that time,
"We've got to wake up Sleeping Beauty."


329
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.410
Then Joe Hale, the producer of
The Black Cauldron, was furious.


330
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.210
"Who are these guys?" he said.
"Sleeping Beauty is awake."


331
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.770
He was fired not long after.

332
00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.450
Black Cauldron cost
$44 million to make


333
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.810
and made less than half that
at the box office.


334
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.450
And, to add insult to injury,

335
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.730
it was beat out at the box office
by The Care Bears Movie.


336
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.650
Oh!

337
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.970
That day, Disney Animation hit bottom.

338
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.490
- This is Ron Clements again.
- Hello.


339
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.250
Explain a little bit about
Basil of Baker Street.


340
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.530
KATZENBERG: One of the first things
Roy did was he arranged one day


341
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.330
for us to be pitched the storyboards
for the entire movie.


342
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.450
KATZENBERG:
And for the better part of three hours,


343
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.850
literally the entire movie
was pitched to us.


344
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.130
You go through one storyboard,
then they bring another


345
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.810
and you'd sit there for hours and--

346
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.930
I couldn't remember
what was in the first storyboard.


347
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.930
It was a very hard process for me
to deal with.


348
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.010
I'd been used to dealing
in the script area.


349
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.010
KATZENBERG:
So when it was over, we all sort of said,


350
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.010
"Thanks very much," and, "Great job."

351
00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.530
And Michael said,
"Walk back to my office with me."


352
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.570
So we walked back.
On the way back to the office,


353
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.930
he said, "What do you think?"
I said, "I have no idea."


354
00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.490
[KATZENBERG LAUGHS]

355
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.050
And he said, "Neither do I."

356
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.050
I said, "Well, here's the thing.

357
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.850
We have 175 people and we're
paying them every day to come to work.


358
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.290
And we're gonna pay them
whether they make this movie


359
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.570
or they don't make this movie, so I guess
we probably ought to make the movie."


360
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.450
And he says to me,
"Well, that's exactly my feeling too."


361
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.210
The live-action business was booming
and Jeffrey needed offices


362
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:24.810
for his new stable of stars,
like Bette Midler and Robin Williams.


363
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.450
He wanted the animation building.

364
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.890
The news came down from the head
of animation, Roy Disney,


365
00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.690
announcing that
the animators would have


366
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.730
to move out of the building
and off the lot.


367
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.410
What was going on here? I mean,

368
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.290
this was the building where Walt Disney
made Cinderella and Peter Pan,


369
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:39.890
and we were having to vacate?

370
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.410
All there was was this memo.

371
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.730
There was no meeting, no debate,
just a memo.


372
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.290
I guess Roy didn't want
the confrontation.


373
00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.090
On our last day, 200 frightened people,

374
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.170
the remnants of Disney's
once great Animation Studio,


375
00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.490
gathered on the steps
of the old Animation building


376
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.970
for one last photo before we left.

377
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.330
GABRIEL: So to carry that forward
into the new building,


378
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.090
which was in Glendale,
not a great area,


379
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:08.090
but the building itself was
such a gutted wretch of a building,


380
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:12.450
with just cinder block and torn-up carpet
and barbed wire around it


381
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.290
and broken bottles
on the crummy little parking lot.

CARTWRIGHT:
So, Ed, what are you doing nowadays?


383
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.850
I'm just emotionally under my desk.

384
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.610
Well, we were all pretty sure
that we'd be fired in a week or so,


385
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.770
so we decided to celebrate
the apparent end of Disney Animation


386
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.250
with a full-scale reenactment
of Apocalypse Now.

[SCREAMING]

389
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.810
We don't have long dark hallways
anymore. We got cubicles.


390
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.130
The warehouse was an open plan,
so you couldn't really hide.


391
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.130
It opened the place to frequent
and spontaneous communications


392
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.050
in the hallways, in the men's room.

393
00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.250
- Come on in.
- Come on.


394
00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.650
The barriers were down.

395
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.130
After the move, Jeffrey called a meeting
of all the animators,


396
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.650
so the crew could air their questions
and concerns.


397
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.930
So Jeffrey got up and said,
"Give me your best shot.


398
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.130
Hit me in the solar plexus.
Ask me anything. I've got rhino skin."


399
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.250
And somebody piped up and said, "We
don't think you know what you're doing."


400
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.730
KATZENBERG: And I said,
"Look, I'm here. I'm not going away.


401
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.930
And I'm more than happy to learn
and take the time and be educated by you.


402
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.810
The fact is that the last couple
of animated movies made


403
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.490
were not particularly good."

404

CLEMENTS: The animation meetings
were usually scheduled,


405
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:33.290
a lot of times,
at 6:00 in the morning.

406
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.850
And so, yeah, I remember driving
to go to those meetings.


407
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.570
And then that sort of strange atmosphere
at that time of the morning,


408
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.850
and hardly anyone is awake or around.

409
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.810
ROY: He began calling meetings
for 8:00 in the morning on Sunday.


410
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.130
And I think it was about the second one,
I was just angry.


411
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.170
Because it's just such a total sign
of disrespect

for a lot of very talented people
who are working their ass off for you.


413
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.410
And I said, "Jeffrey, we gotta have
these meetings at some other time,


414
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.210
because I promise you, if you have
another one of these things at 8 a.m.,


415
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.290
I'm showing up in my pajamas."

416
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.970
- Aren't you proud of it, Mr. Disney?
WALT: Why, I'm so proud, I think I'll bust.

It was just around the corner.


419
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.730
And he said, "You know, I'm not interested
in the Academy Awards.


420
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.570
I'm interested in
the Bank of America awards," you know.


421
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.410
"What the money these things pull in."

422
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.450
And it was just absolutely
the worst thing to tell a room full of artists.


423
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.010
It was so discouraging.

424
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.010
ROY:
Jeffrey, one day, he said to me,


425
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.730
"You really need
to get your own Jeffrey Katzenberg."


426
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.410
And I began thinking and thinking,
"You know, it's right.


427
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:48.090
I can't do this by myself
and I'm not that talented anyway."


428
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.690
So the call I made was
to Bob Fitzpatrick,


429
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.210
who was in the Olympic Arts Festival
at the time.


430
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.970
He says, "I think I have somebody.
I'll send him over to you.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.330
His name is Peter Schneider."

432
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.370
SCHNEIDER: I was living in a small
apartment with my wife and baby daughter,


433
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.850
and she said to me,
"Go get a job," you know.


434
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.050
I was naive. I had no baggage,
no preconceived notions.


435
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.970
I didn't care
what had been done in the past.


436
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.970
I knew that I could do no worse
than The Black Cauldron.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.970
You know,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.130
Peter was given the title
of vice president,


439
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:21.050
which, to the insurgent population
of animators, made him the Man.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.450
And the main weapon to fight the Man
was the dreaded caricature.


441
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.730
PRUIKSMA: Well, Peter was
kind of a scary thing, you know.


442
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.450
A small frame, wiry, and, you know,
full of nervous energy. He was like, "Nyah."


443
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.650
TROUSDALE:
He looked like he was about 15 years old.


444
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.210
He had this perpetual smile
that everybody caricatured.


445
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:41.690
It was like this kind of wide-eyed,
predatory smile that really worried people.


446
00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.170
PRUIKSMA:
You'd go into his office,


447
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.970
he would just sit all twisted up
like a pretzel. It was odd.


448
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.330
And he had a little button that closed
the door behind you when you went in.


449
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.170
When the door closed,
you'd kind of look back


450
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.970
and see if there were scratch marks on it
or something like that. Ha-ha-ha!


451
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.170
SCHNEIDER: When I got to Animation,
I knew I had a hundred days


452
00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.650
to change the culture
before it changed me.


453
00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.250
I was trying to empower people,

454
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.730
to make them feel good about themselves,
to value the work.


455
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.490
I brought in some of my own people
who'd worked for me in theater.


456
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.170
Kathleen Gavin, Maureen Donley,
Tom Schumacher.


457
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.930
- Sticky buns.
ANIMATORS: Sticky buns.


458
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.850
SCHNEIDER:
I brought in Lakers coach Pat Riley


459
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:16.930
to talk about winning and teamwork.

460
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.370
Peter picked apart every piece
of the production process.


461
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.690
Why are we punching time clocks?
Why are we making our own paint?


462
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.930
Why can't we update our animation pegs?
Why don't we have more computers?


463
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.210
What about training?

464
00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.770
It had this feeling of a freight train
leaving the station at light speed.


465
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.730
You better jump on or jump off fast.

466
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.450
Most people got on and it was a wild ride,
an exciting time.


467
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.290
There was this team-sport mentality.

468
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.410
You can't play the game unless
everybody is firing off on all cylinders.


469
00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.690
Even second string, you were hungry
to be part of this, to jump into the game.


470
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:47.770
There was an openness,
a permission, almost,


471
00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.890
to be critical about anything.
Anything but the Marketing Department.


472
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:55.970
Marketing thought that the title
Basil of Baker Street


473
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.730
was a real head-scratcher
and they wanted to change it.


474
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.890
So Peter sent off a memo announcing
that they were changing the title to:


475
00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.450
The Great Mouse Detective.

476
00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:07.290
GABRIEL: The resistance was pretty
fierce and we all started trying things


477
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.770
to get it to be our way
and it wasn't gonna change.


478
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.970
One of the artists got the bright idea
to send out a fake memo, in Peter's name,


479
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:17.450
saying that now all the Disney films
will be renamed.


480
00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.850
From now on, Snow White would become
Seven Little Men Help a Girl.


481
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.130
And Pinocchio would be
The Wooden Boy Who Became Real.


482
00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.970
Peter saw the joke memo
as undermining his authority


483
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.450
and demanded to know
who wrote the memo.


484
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.770
The artists saw it as good clean fun
and kept the author a secret.


485
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.250
They even sent it up to Jeffrey's office
for added amusement.


486
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.930
GABRIEL:
Peter, I think his tires were slashed


487
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.330
or somebody busted his window
in his car in the lot.


488
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.970
Some, you know, really mature way
to handle the situation.


489
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.610
Peter came in and put us all
in the screening room


490
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.530
and just tore us a new one.

491
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.770
TROUSDALE: That was the fabled
triple-veiner that Peter had,


492
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.690
where, I mean, he was, like, levitating
and glowing, he was so mad.


493
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.090
GABRIEL: I think after that meeting,
we all kind of respected him.


494
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.610
What I love is he didn't say,

495
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.130
"Shut up.
If you don't like it, there's the gate."


496
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.250
He said,
"We're gonna make great films."


497
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.770
SCHNEIDER: And Jeffrey just laughed it off
and said, "Don't even worry about it."


498
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.290
And I think that cemented my relationship
with Jeffrey, in some weird way,


499
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.610
and also cemented my relationship
with the artists.


500
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:20.450
And as a bonus, the memo even ended up
as a category on Jeopardy!


501
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.010
TREBEK:
And finally, In Other Words.


502
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.530
In Other Words came about
as the result of a big foofaraw


503
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.530
that occurred at the Disney Studios
last year


504
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.770
when the employees staged
a minor revolt


505
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.290
when they changed the title of
Basil of Baker Street


506
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.850
to The Great Mouse Detective.

507
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.450
In Other Words for 300.

508
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.130
TREBEK:
"The girl with the see-through shoes."


509
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.690
- Marjorie.
- Who is Cinderella?


510
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.010
TREBEK:
Who is Cinderella? Good.


511
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.770
The Great Mouse Detective was released
in 1986 to good reviews


512
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.330
and respectable box office.

513
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:48.690
But there was a new animation threat
in town.


514
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.090
Steven Spielberg.

515
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.010
Steven loved the films of Walt Disney,
so he jumped into the game,


516
00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.450
teaming up with none other
than Don Bluth,


517
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.490
the animator who kicked us
when we were down.


518
00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.690
That year,
An American Tail quickly became


519
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.170
the highest-grossing
non-Disney animated feature ever,


520
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.770
beating out The Great Mouse Detective
by over $22 million.


521
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.850
ALLERS:
Oliver--


522
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.010
That's funny.

523
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.930
SCHNEIDER: When I first got there,
Oliver and Company was being made.


524
00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.130
It had two directors.

525
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.530
CARTWRIGHT: This is Rick Rich.
- Hello.


526
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.010
CARTWRIGHT: This is George Scribner.
SCHNEIDER: I fired Rick Rich,


527
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.370
who was belligerent to me,

528
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.650
and kept George Scribner,
who sucked up to me.


529
00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.570
It seemed like the right decision
at the time.


530
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.450
People who like you get ahead.

531
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:32.530
Peter brought his theatrical background
to the animation business.


532
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.690
He demanded that filmmakers pick
their own teams based on talent


533
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:40.210
and who they wanted to work with,
not on some form of institutional seniority.


534
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.890
If you didn't have a strong point of view,
you disappeared.


535
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.010
There was creative debate.
You had to defend your ideas.


536
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.210
It meant that more drawings went into
the trash than went up on the screen.


537
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.050
Throwaway drawings.
The drawings we just throw away


538
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.090
- that don't mean anything.
MAN: Tore it in half.


539
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.450
These are the ones
that we didn't even use.


540
00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:07.810
Revisions. Every line a writer changed,

541
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.050
[SOFT POP MUSIC PLAYING]

542
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.010
SAWYER: And because the family name
is still the franchise,


543
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.610
the company still produces
a few of those Disney animated features,


544
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.330
even though they cost a fortune
to create.


545
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.970
The new one is an animated version
of Oliver Twist,


546
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:27.690
with Billy Joel and Bette Midler doing
the singing and barking and growling.


547
00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:31.130
But the finished film may well require
a half-million frames,


548
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:36.250
each one drawn by an artist at a total cost
of more than $10 million,


549
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.330
more than it can make back
anytime soon.


550
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.650
Can you really afford

551
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.610
to do what you wanna do in animation
as much as you wanna do?


552
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.090
The answer is no,
but we're doing it anyway.


553
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.650
- We have to do it in this company.
- Have to?


554
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.770
We have to. That is our legacy.

555
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.610
WOMAN: The animation area,
the full-length animation,


556
00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.450
you have made a promise
to do one film a year. Is that it?


557
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:04.130
- Well, Roy made it, so I'm--
- We jointly made that one.


558
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:09.730
Yeah, it's our intent
to make a new one every year.


559
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:14.290
Oliver will be the first in that group.

560
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.370
And Little Mermaid, the following year,
is on schedule


561
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.850
to be released a year from now.
And we think we can do it.


562
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:25.090
We're accumulating more and more
and better artists


563
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.490
and certainly more
and more experience as we go.


564
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.210
Helping to feed the coffers in a big way
was a machine called the VCR


565
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.890
that could actually play movies
from a cassette tape


566
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.770
in your own living room.

567
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.930
PAULEY:
The releasing of Pinocchio in video,


568
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.730
Disney was never gonna do that.

569
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.250
I thought that was carved in granite

570
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:49.850
that they would be held in storage for
seven years and then released carefully.


571
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.090
How was the decision made
to put them out in video?


572
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.010
I don't think there's been any more
careful decision than we have reached.


573
00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.290
And we have reached it so far only
in respect to the one classic, Pinocchio.


574
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.770
It's out now this summer.
It's doing very well.


575
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.490
It's only after that that we'll slowly decide
what to do with the rest of it.


576
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:11.690
And after all, a video release this summer
hardly is gonna affect Pinocchio


577
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.610
when it's released theatrically
another seven years from now.


578
00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.210
Pinocchio went out as a trial balloon
and made millions.


579
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.050
It was like a license to print money,
since there were no costs for the old titles.


580
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.850
But that immediately upped the ante
to get more titles into the pipeline.


581
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.530
So to find these new titles,
anybody, artists, secretaries, janitors,


582
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:32.370
could come in and pitch their ideas
in a gong show.


583
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.650
Some ideas, like Pocahontas,

584
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.450
were green-lit
from a single drawing and a title.


585
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.850
Others, like Little Mermaid,
were gonged at first,


586
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.810
because it was too much like Splash,
but came back later.


587
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.090
And there were all sorts of projects
being green-lit.


588
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.410
A sequel idea called
Rescuers Down Under, set in Australia.


589
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.850
Prince And The Pauper,
starring Mickey Mouse.


590
00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.330
And an old shelved project

591
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:56.730
that Walt Disney himself considered
back in the 1940s, Beauty and the Beast.


592
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.410
SAWYER: Not only does the ghost
of Walt Disney, the creative genius,


593
00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.090
keep Eisner awake at night.

594
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.930
When he first came to the company,

595
00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:06.330
he discovered that executives routinely
made decisions by asking,


596
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.850
"What would Walt have done?"

597
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.410
ROY: To a certain extent, people,
somebody, would surely have said,


598
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.250
"Walt probably wouldn't
have done that."


599
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.770
We needed to break that cycle

600
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.090
and we needed to get out
into the whole town.


601
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:22.730
The argument that says, "Some dead guy
is trying to run your operation."


602
00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.290
You can't do that.

603
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.050
I don't think Disney
is like the constitution.


604
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.450
I don't think we have to preserve it
and put it in glass.


605
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.770
I think it's a growing--
And if it's not growing, it's gonna die.


606
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.130
Our name is a fantastic asset

607
00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.290
and it represents a terrific man
who was very creative.


608
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.450
And I'd hate to be the person
who shot himself in the foot and ended it.


609
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.330
I don't wanna leave that legacy.
I'd like to keep it going.


610
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.850
But I'd like to add to it.
I'd like to have new things.


611
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.410
What do you worry about?

612
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.970
Shooting myself in the foot.

613
00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.490
[JAPANESE POP MUSIC PLAYING]

614
00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:03.410
MICHAEL: Disney's net profits tripled since

615
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.810
Disney people are proud to call
themselves a Mickey Mouse operation.


616
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.010
According to most analysts,
the magic returned


617
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.690
with the appointment of Frank Wells
as president of the company


618
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.330
and Michael Eisner as chairman.

619
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.010
Under Eisner and Wells,
the new Touchstone Movie Division


620
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.890
became a production powerhouse,

621
00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.850
turning out such hits as
Down and Out in Beverly Hills,


622
00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.850
Ruthless People, 
The Color of Money,

623
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.730
and what amounts to a farm club
for feature filmmakers,


624
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.410
The Disney Sunday Movie.

625
00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:30.410
1987 is off to a promising start
with the addition


626
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.890
of the Michael Jackson attraction,
Captain EO,


627
00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.690
and the Disney/George Lucas
collaborative adventure, Star Tours.


628
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.730
The live-action movies, the parks,
the merchandise were all on fire,


629
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:41.170
but Animation,

630
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.050
well, we still seemed like a stepchild.

631
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.530
KEANE: And I gotta say, I was very
nervous about where we were heading,


632
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.650
where was the future of Disney going.

633
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:55.610
It seemed to be being driven
by a maniac at the wheel,


634
00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:01.410
in terms of Jeffrey,
with his heavy foot on the accelerator,


635
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.570
driving full speed in a very crowded city.

636
00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.850
- Action.
- Aaaggh!


637
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.570
An old development project called
Who Framed Roger Rabbit


638
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.170
shifted into hyper-drive when
Steven Spielberg became interested.


639
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.010
You know,
I have been influenced profoundly


640
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.770
by the films of Walt Disney,

641
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:24.050
especially the films from the '30s,
'40s and right through the '50s.


642
00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:29.570
And I really feel that this is a movie
that we're making for Walt.


643
00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.170
Back to the Future director
Robert Zemeckis


644
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.210
was signed to direct Roger Rabbit.

645
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.850
Bob and Steven made up
the creative team on the film,


646
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.090
while Jeffrey
watched the purse strings.


647
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:45.250
We always wanted the Disney technique,
the beautiful Disney animation,


648
00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.730
the great Warner Bros.
characterization.


649
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.090
Yes?

650
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.730
ZEMECKIS:
And Tex Avery humor.


651
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.490
You know,
dynamite-down-your-pants type stuff.


652
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.410
And the rabbit's like--
Doesn't wanna go back in and Hoskins...


653
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.250
It was a trifecta of elements

654
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:04.330
that Bob knew he couldn't get
from the Disney Animation Department,


655
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.450
so he turned to animation veteran
Richard Williams


656
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.090
to animate the movie in London,

657
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.690
and Peter sent me to London
to ride herd on the animation.


658
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:14.810
It was a real stomach punch
for the guys back in Burbank,


659
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:19.090
but the truth was nobody really thought
much of Disney Animation back then.


660
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.010
The combination of Spielberg,
Zemeckis and Dick Williams


661
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.290
was like a talent magnet

662
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.330
and animators from all over the world
just flocked to the project.


663
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.570
So now there was a unit in Burbank
and one in London.


664
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:34.090
And Peter would travel back and forth
to rattle everybody's cage.


665
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.290
When he was in London,

666
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.410
he'd say how great the guys in Burbank
were doing on The Little Mermaid.


667
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:39.650
Then back in Burbank,

668
00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.290
he'd brag about how great the guys on
Roger Rabbit were doing.


669
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.330
Nobody had attempted a movie
like this before,


670
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.730
and the budget just soared.

671
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.810
It got so heated that Jeffrey
summoned us all to New York


672
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:52.210
to tell us that we did not have
one more dime to spend on this movie.


673
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.970
No more money.

674
00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:57.970
Then we all took limos, helicopters to
the airport to fly Concorde back to London.


675
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.650
He spent all this money on a meeting
to tell us we had no money.


676
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.650
- Animation...
- It was a very Hollywood moment.


677
00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.730
Back home, Jeffrey was getting beat up
by Michael about the costs.


678
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.890
EISNER: We just had to put
a financial box around all this creativity.


679
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.330
And without that, the end result
would have been complete chaos.


680
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:16.290
KATZENBERG:
It created a tremendous amount of friction


681
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:19.570
and difficulty between Michael and I,

682
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.050
not because he didn't believe
in the movie. He did.


683
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.210
Financially it just became so expensive.

684
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.690
And Michael,
who is fundamentally conservative,


685
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.330
just got very, very uncomfortable with it.

686
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.210
Cut. Let's do it again.

687
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.210
KATZENBERG:
And I was unable to control it.


688
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.370
Who Framed Roger Rabbit
is one of those home runs


689
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.170
that Hollywood hits
every once in a while.


690
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:52.090
It's a movie like 2001 or Close Encounters
or especially like E.T.


691
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.610
that's a technical breakthrough
and a lot of fun both at the same time.


692
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:56.970
Roger Rabbit made headlines

693
00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:01.370
and won Oscars for technical innovation
and returned just millions to the studio.


694
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.930
The top talent on Roger
was shipped back to Burbank


695
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.970
and put to work on Oliver and Company
and Little Mermaid.


696
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.810
It was like an injection of fresh, young,
international talent


697
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.890
that would pay dividends
for years to come.


698
00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.730
Six months later,
Oliver and Company opened


699
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:18.090
on the same day
as Spielberg's Land Before Time.


700
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.410
Come on. Let's eat him!

701
00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.050
SCRIBNER: Well, by the end
of the three or four months,


702
00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.650
we'd made 55, 56, 54.

703
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.810
And we beat Land Before Time
and it was like--


704
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.410
I think a lot of people were like,
"Hey, there's something--


705
00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:33.090
There's something here."

706
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.970
The chaos that Roy ushered in when
he hired Michael was starting to pay off


707
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.410
and suddenly everybody was happy
to be associated with Toontown.


708
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.610
INTERVIEWER: This is the first fairy tale
that Disney has done


709
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:55.530
MAN: Take two.
- in the last 30 years, three decades.


710
00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.210
Why was Mermaid chosen?

711
00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.090
Well, I mean, it was chosen
because we all went to a lunch


712
00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.410
about three or four years ago
and all of us--


713
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.410
It was sort of a development-type thing.

714
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.890
And we were supposed to come in
with our three ideas.


715
00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.290
I don't know if you can use any of this,
but this is sort of more the truth than,


716
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.490
you know,
what we may wind up saying later.


717
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.530
And basically they wanted to draw
on different ideas.


718
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:23.970
And one of the ideas that Ron brought in
was The Little Mermaid.


719
00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.810
He had-
- That was one of his three.

720
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.250
Jeffrey's friend David Geffen

721
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:31.010
called him about a songwriting team,
Howard Ashman and Alan Menken,


722
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.450
that he'd worked with on the off-Broadway
hit Little Shop of Horrors.


723
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:37.650
Peter had worked with them
on the same show as company manager,


724
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.610
so he brought them in
to work on The Little Mermaid.


725
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.250
SCHNEIDER: Howard was just coming off
a terrible disappointment


726
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.250
when his musical Smile
crashed and burned on Broadway.


727
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.490
He came to Los Angeles
to start over again.


728
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.970
Howard wasn't exactly the first guy who
sprang to mind when you said Disney.


729
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.330
He was born into a Jewish family
in Baltimore,


730
00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.650
where he grew up on-stage in the local

When I was approached
with an opportunity


733
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.490
to work for Disney, period,
I leapt at the--


734
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.690
I said, "What about Animation?
What about working in that department?"


735
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.690
That was what
I really wanted to do here,


736
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:18.010
much, much more
than anything, really, in live-action.


737
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.010
Because I'm really
a musical-theater person


738
00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:24.370
and I do see a very, very strong
connection between these two media.


739
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.770
We had this character
in the original treatment, the script.


740
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.730
It was a crab character
that was kind of-- Would be--

and watch over her.

- The king's right-hand guy.


745
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.650
who worked for the king and was like
the conductor in the undersea world.

Howard said,
"Why not make him Jamaican?"


747
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.770
And our first reaction was, "Jamaican?"

748
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.210
I mean, it was like a total twist
on what we were thinking.


749
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:53.570
He rounds up all of these fish
and all of this stuff

to convince Ariel not to try
to become human.

put on a show for her

The clams pick it up, and oysters,
and he's beating on lobsters, whatever.

trying to treat it
sort of a little more off-the-cuff,


764
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:54.290
but I think he had written all the songs
five minutes after he got the treatment,

In almost every musical ever written,


787
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.010
there's a place, it's usually
the third song of the evening.


788
00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:10.530
Sometimes it's the second, sometimes
it's the fourth, but it's quite early.

sometimes it's a tree stump
in Brigadoon,

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.930
sometimes it's under the pillars
of Covent Garden in My Fair Lady,

Jodi Benson singing that,

I thought, "I have to do that."

And I went and told those guys,
"I really wanna do Ariel."

Can you do that?"

And so the kids--

During that screening, a lot of the movie
was in black and white.

went to Jeffrey and said,

"Jeffrey, you cannot cut this.

And to cut that will really gut our
emotional involvement with our heroine."


825
00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:56.610
KATZENBERG: He persuaded me
that the issue wasn't the song,


826
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:00.130
but other things that were not firing up yet
in the sort of rhythm of the movie.


827
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:03.130
And ultimately he was right.
Not only did it stay in the movie,

Over the last five years,
the Disney Animation Department


831
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.490

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.650

to ink and paint, to the screen.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:30.690
is kind of a renaissance period
for the artists themselves.

Jeffrey started discovering Animation


837
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.610
as a place where he could be artistic,
a powerhouse in the editing room,


838
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.810
and where he could be the frontman
to the press.


839
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.250
I think he realized something
very important to his future.


840
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:45.570
"I'm good at this. This is fun, it's mine
and it doesn't include Michael."


841
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.810
The press on Little Mermaid
was just spectacular.


842
00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.890
And the box office, well,
was even better than Oliver and Company.


843
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:54.170
And there were loads of toys, books,
puzzles and lunch boxes


844
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.010
that just flew off the shelves.

845
00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.370
Animation had a big hit on its hands.

846
00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:01.410
SCHNEIDER:
Jeffrey and Michael started focusing on,


847
00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.890
"Oh, if we have more titles,
it'll be better financially."


848
00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.690
And I always fought for,

849
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.890
"Can you take some of those resources
and put them back into the business?"

One of the technology guys, Lem Davis,
thought we could use computers


853
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:23.090
to paint the characters in our films
and digitally assemble all the artwork.


854
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:28.530
That gives us not only the opportunity
to do some really good art,


855
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.570
but it also gives us the opportunity
to really begin to explore


856
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.930
what these computers
and graphics things can do for us


857

in kind of shorter pieces
where we can get really a little crazy.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.730
And I'm looking forward to all of us
getting a little crazy.

to spend $10 million

that might not return a dime,


861
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.330
but would revolutionize the look
of our films.


862
00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.730
ROY: So I just walked down the hall
and stood there in Frank's doorway.


863
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:56.930
Frank looks up and says,
"What are you doing here?"


864
00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.850

you sign that check, Frank."

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.690
SCHUMACHER: What I remember most
of that period was feeling so brokenhearted


877
00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:41.290
that we had attempted to make
a feature film using the CAPS system


878
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.210
before anyone
had even made a short with it.


879
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:45.290
We had never tested the system
before we committed


880
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:47.250
to a release date to make a movie.

KIMBALL:
And it's 3:00 in the morning.


882
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.130
Peter Schneider walks in
and looks over at me and goes,


883
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.210
"Well, is it working yet?
Is it working yet?" Ha-ha-ha.


884
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.210
And it's like,
"Oh, I don't need this pressure."


885
00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.130
GABRIEL: My first film,
Rescuers Down Under, came out.


886
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:04.130
Phone rings at like 8 in the morning.
"Mike?" "Yeah." "Jeffrey."


887
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.210
"Yeah. So, what's going on?
What's the numbers?"


888
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.810
He said, "Made 5 million. It's over."

889
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:10.290
"Well, excuse me, what?"

890
00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.050
"It's over. Forget it. Move on."

891
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.170
SCHUMACHER:
Jeffrey pulled all the TV advertising.


892
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:19.170
And I said, "Jeffrey,
I just can't believe that. You've pulled it?


893
00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:20.930
There's no advertising, nothing?"

894
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.530
And he said, "Tom,
the movie just doesn't work. It's over."


895
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.490
And I started to cry on the telephone.

896
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:30.450
And then he said, "It's okay.

897
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.490
We're gonna move forward
and we'll do something else.


898
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.810
Are you okay?"

899
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.290
I said, "I'm all right." He goes,
"Okay, we'll start again tomorrow."


900
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:39.690
And then he hung up the phone.

901
00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:43.530
Rescuers was the very first digital movie
produced in Hollywood.


902
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.330
And without it we would never
have achieved what would come later.

[BIRD CRIES]

904
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.130
Beauty and the Beast was up next

905
00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:56.690
and the budget and schedule
were cut way, way back.


906
00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:01.130
SCHNEIDER: We asked Richard Williams
to direct the film, but Williams declined


907
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.690
and recommended one of his protÃ©gÃ©s,
Richard Purdum, to direct instead.


908
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.690
Purdum was a very successful
commercial director based in the U.K.


909
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:10.530
MAN: Yeah.
KEANE: And then the horse rises up


910
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.050
- right underneath him.
- Yeah.


911
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.850
KEANE: Now he's riding on the rear end
of the horse,


912
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.410
hanging on to the horse's tail,

913
00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:20.130
and one of the wolves grabs up
right onto the tail, yanks the horse,


914
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.250
and the horse rears up
and throws the guy off


915
00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.650
and the guy lands on the back
of the wolf, riding on the wolf.


916
00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:29.010
It was my first job as producer
and I wanted to get everything just right.


917
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.050
So I recruited a commando story team
of Disney artists


918
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.410
and we moved to London to set to work
on a non-musical version of the story.


919
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.570
After about six months,
we took the first 20 minutes of the film


920
00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.010
to screen for Jeffrey.

921

Has my niece given you an answer?

MAN: Um, not yet.
I think she's playing the coquette with me.


923
00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.250
WOMAN:
Forgive her.


924
00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.810
HAHN: It wasn't perfect, but what was
the worst that could happen?


925
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:56.250
They weren't gonna scrap it and start
over again. That would be just insane.


926
00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:59.650
It didn't work at all for us,
so we literally scrapped it,


927
00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:02.450
the first 20 minutes of the movie,
and started all over again.


928
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:05.490
SCHNEIDER: Richard Purdum worked for a
few more months on Beauty and the Beast,


929
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:09.130
and when it became clear that we would
never make his version of the movie,


930
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:10.450
he resigned.

931
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.930
I recruited two young story artists
to be the acting directors


932
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:16.970
and moved the entire project back
to the warehouses in Burbank.


933
00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.170
The spotlight kind of turned
on me and Gary,


934
00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.770
which struck us as incredibly odd,
because--


935
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:24.770
The spotlight turned on us
like when you turn on the kitchen light


936
00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:27.370
and the roaches are on the floor.
We were like, "What?"


937
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.090
[BOTH LAUGHING]

938
00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.250
We didn't get away in time
and they caught us.


939
00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.970
So we were made kind of the acting
directors of Beauty and the Beast,


940
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.010
- which meant--
- We had to act like directors.


941
00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:41.530
Meanwhile, back in California,
Jeffrey threw his annual beach party.


942
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:45.290
SCHNEIDER: And there was Tom Cruise
and Bette Midler and Robin Williams,


943
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.050
all on the beach at Jeffrey's house.

944
00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.010
And I remember being there
with Howard Ashman,


945
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.090
because after Little Mermaid,
Howard asked to go work


946
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.010
on this other thing he was desperate to do
for Disney called Aladdin,


947
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.970
at exactly the same time
Beauty and the Beast


948
00:47:58.170 --> 00:47:59.730
was sort of falling apart in London.

949
00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.650
Jeffrey buttonholed Howard,
as only he can,


950
00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:05.650
and convinced Howard to write the songs
for Beauty and the Beast


951
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:07.410
even though Howard
didn't really want to.


952
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.970
WISE: Well, we got a phone call
from our boss.


953
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:14.330
"We want you to meet with Howard
and Alan and the whole creative team


954
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.490
and Beauty and the Beast is gonna
become a musical." We couldn't believe it.


955
00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:22.210
So we ended up setting up shop
at the Residence Inn, upstate New York,


956
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:23.730
in Howard's neck of the woods.

957
00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.570
And we started hashing stuff out
and throwing around ideas.


958
00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.890
Initially it was very, very collegial.
It was very upbeat.


959
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:31.170
We were having a lot of fun.

960
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.250
But one of the things
that was a sticking point,


961
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.570
something that we didn't agree on,
was how to open the movie.


962
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.690
And Howard felt very passionately

963
00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:41.210
that the movie should open
with a fully animated prologue


964
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:45.690
that showed the Beast in his prince form,
except he would be a little boy.


965
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.050
He'd be a naughty little boy.

966
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:52.530
And to Gary and I, we could not get past
this Eddie Munster image,


967
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:57.850
you know, of this hairy little kid
in Little Lord Fauntleroy pants.


968
00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:01.770
To Howard, it seemed
incredibly moving and tragic.


969
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.490
TROUSDALE:
He was also very opinionated


970
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.370
and very articulate
and very intimidating.


971
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:10.690
And so we were scared of him.
It's like, "Okay, we gotta do this."


972
00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:15.250
WISE: And so, you know, like the stupid,
naive, 26-year-old kid that I was,


973

I opened the meeting with,

974
00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:22.570
"We think that the little Beast boy
is kind of a cheap shot."


975
00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:27.610
And I think the word "cheap"
really set Howard off.


976
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.490

And his mouth was a very tight line

ROY: He was an amazing influence
on everybody.


1023
00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.690
And I don't want to compare him
to Walt,


1024
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:38.450
but on the other hand,
he had that kind of influence on everybody.


1025
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.610
Before Beauty and the Beast was finished,
we threw a big dog-and-pony show


1026
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.290
for the New York press where
we showed some clips from the film

and Alan sang some of the songs.

KATZENBERG:
I don't think we could have ever imagined


1029
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:57.170
a more enraptured reception
to the movie and the songs.


1030
00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:01.010
And we all were very excited about
the idea of sharing this with Howard.


1031
00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:03.330
We wanted him to hear the news.

in a cab and we raced downtown

to St. Vincent's.

1034

We rushed from the press presentation,

1035
00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:15.250
which, as rough as it was,
was a huge success.


1036
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:18.010
We were high from it
and we came into the cold shock


1037
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:21.010
of Howard dying in a hospital room.

1038
00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:23.770
His mother pulled back the sheets
to show us

the Beauty and the Beast sweatshirt
that he was wearing.


1040
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:33.130
He was 80 pounds, had lost his sight
and barely had a whisper of a voice.


1041
00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:37.010
We shared with him what happened
that day and how amazing it was.


1042
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.770
And how he was there in every way.

Then, when it was time to leave,
we said our goodbyes.

Before I left, 
I bent over and whispered,

Beauty and the Beast
was gonna be a great success.

"Who'd have thought it?" I said.

COOK: Gary Kalkin, who was running
Publicity at the time, had a brilliant idea,


1050
00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:34.890
a scary idea, a dangerous idea
that perhaps an unfinished

work-in-progress screening
of Beauty and the Beast

could be a part
of the New York Film Festival.


1053
00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:46.290
So we actually screened
an unfinished version of the film


1054
00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.210
and I think we were all
on pins and needles.

We all were sitting there
holding our breath,

what kind of reaction there would be.

When the movie ended,

where you went, "1001, 1002,"

at a live Broadway show.

through intense story changes

that left three of Howard's songs
on the cutting-room floor.

the first thing we look for
is a very special story

Who's the next Walt Disney?

1105

The media demands a central
charismatic figure.

All of us here at Disney
hope you enjoyed the tour


1109

and that it gave you new insight

into the magic of motion-picture
and television production.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:31.050
KATZENBERG: Frank, of all of us,
was the most selfless,


1114
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:35.570
and so he was able
to navigate a course


1115
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:40.490
between strong
and growing personalities and egos.


1116
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:44.610
And I always found Frank
the peacemaker, you know,


1117
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.730
that he was like a marriage counselor.

He was very much of a mediator.

you ran to when you had problems.

EISNER: Interesting thing about Frank,
he carried in his wallet


1121
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:59.810
a piece of paper that said,
"Humility is the ultimate virtue."

You get it from the top
and you get it from the bottom

and are often left floating
somewhere in the middle

and purpose.


1125

It was a delicate balancing act
that began to wobble

But I am delighted to be the first,

SCHNEIDER:
At the cast-and-crew screening,


1129
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.130
there's tradition of everybody
getting up and speaking


1130
00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:42.970
and saying how great everything is.

1131
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:57.050
SCHNEIDER: Until that night, I don't think
I was aware to the extent of the animosity


1132
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:59.170
between Michael, 
Roy and Jeffrey.

1133
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:25.130
ROY: Yeah, and I was sitting right
in the very first row in the corner seat,


1134
00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:28.050
looking up at him, saying,
"Announce it, Michael."


1135
00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:30.530
SCHNEIDER:
And Michael stood up and said,


1136
00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:34.090
"As part of the reward
of this extraordinary growth,


1137
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:36.050
the amazing things you've all done,

1138
00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:41.370
Frank and I have agreed to build a new
Animation Building on the Disney lot."


1139
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.850
It was the first time Jeffrey
had ever heard that.


1140
00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.450
KATZENBERG: In the moment,
I was enraged by it, because I felt,


1141
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.650
"Wow, what are these guys
doing here?"


1142
00:59:49.810 --> 00:59:51.370
It was inappropriate.

1143
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:54.730
And the subtext to that
was much, much deeper


1144
00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:59.210
than just the faux pas
of announcing a building,


1145
00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.770
you know, without having ever
even discussed it with me.


1146
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:06.210
And it just showed
very deep-seated unhappiness


1147
01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:09.090
and competitiveness and ego.

1148
01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.650
It was all about respect.

1149
01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:12.650
That night, Jeffrey was looking
for the respect


1150
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.570
he thought he'd earned from
Roy and Michael,


1151
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.490
and it just wasn't there.

1152

Lightning has struck twice with Disney's
Beauty and the Beast.


1153
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.890
I'm hard-pressed,
had to go to the thesaurus


1154
01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:23.770
to find all the applicable adjectives:

1155

Enchanting, bewitching,
captivating, charming...


1156

Beauty and the Beast
opened to huge box office


1157
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:32.610
and probably the most glowing reviews of
any animated feature since Snow White.


1158
01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:34.930
I've seen Beauty and the Beast twice
with my children.


1159
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:38.210
I'm going to be back for more very soon.
It's a winner.


1160
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:40.410
I was amazed
how much I enjoyed this movie.


1161
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.170
I had heard reports that it played
at the New York Film Festival


1162
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:44.530
- to a standing ovation
- Right.


1163
01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:46.690
- and I questioned those reports.
- I did too.

- Yeah.

I was sitting at what had to have been
the furthest table from the stage,

01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:14.930
back with the busboys
and the valet-parking guys.


1175
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.970
But this was a validation from Hollywood
that we'd never really seen before.


1176
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.770
And maybe, just maybe,

1177
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:24.810
this meant that animation was no longer
at the kids' card table in the kitchen.

Beauty and the Beast got six nominations,
including a nomination for Best Picture.


1192
01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:05.530
Now that really sets a record here,
because in the history of Disney,


1193
01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:08.770
Disney has only
had Best Picture nominees twice,

once for Mary Poppins
and once for the Dead Poets Society.

that Beauty was nominated,

You'll know better a few years from now.

KEANE:
By the time Aladdin came,


1219
01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:21.410
the animation marathon was really
beginning to tell on the physical strength,


1220
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:23.610
I mean, just in terms of endurance.

1221
01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:27.410
Now there was this,
"Okay, how are you in the long run?

Can you keep going?"

Many of the artists had physical problems
with their carpel tunnel syndrome.

And I remember on one day,
it was the Day of Atonement.

Jeffrey came to the studio
and asked everybody to sit down with him


1226
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:44.650
and just tell him what it was like
to work with him.


1227
01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:46.490
And he said, "Just be honest with me."

1228
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:51.170
People started to share what working
at Disney Animation was really like.


1229
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:52.730
Some people couldn't have a family,

1230
01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:57.970
because they really had no way of being
able to raise kids in this kind of pressure.


1231
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.210
For me, holding a coffee cup,
my hand would shake,


1232
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.050
was just shaking so badly,

1233
01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:06.130
because I'd been animating
the whole night before.


1234
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:10.090
It was the only time that I had seen Jeffrey
with a tear in his eyes


1235
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:15.650
from just being moved
by what he was pushing the artists to do.


1236
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:20.170
And he said, "This is not right.
You have to have a life."


1237
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:22.970
Nothing changed. 
In fact, it got busier.

1238
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:26.170
And it would have been easy to blame
Jeffrey or Michael for pushing hard,


1239
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:27.650
because they were, but, you know,

1240
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:30.130
the truth is that the artists were pushing
just as hard.

The rewards were pouring in,
so we all kept trying to top ourselves.

Suddenly, there were bonuses

1243

and the parking lot was just full
of BMWs and Porsches.

We were getting a new building

and agents and appearing on talk shows.

that was also, personally as an artist,

the nights away from family,

returned to the studio

to make a stop-motion movie,
The Nightmare Before Christmas.

away from Pixar,

but John insisted on staying
with the struggling start-up company.

So Peter struck a deal with John

to direct a computer-animated
co-production with Disney,

production of Beauty and the Beast.


1269

Five years earlier, the care and focus
was on one picture at a time,


1270
01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:51.730
and now there were five movies
and a Broadway show

on the red carpet is Matthew Broderick.


1454
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:10.130
About four years ago,
we all decided we were gonna make it,


1455
01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:13.690
and so, you know,
you fall in love pretty soon after that.


1456
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:17.770
So four years ago, I would say,
"Well, yeah," but now, it's great.


1457
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:20.410
By the time The Lion King
premiered in Hollywood,


1458
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:22.330
the press had picked up
on the tensions


1459
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:26.290
and Jeffrey waved off all interviews
on the red carpet.


1460
01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:30.930
KATZENBERG: I had lunch with Michael
and, you know, he said to me,


1461
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:34.610
"I'm not interested
in having you take this job.


1462
01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:38.130
Even though I said I was
and promised you that you were,


1463
01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:39.570
I've changed my mind."

1464
01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:41.330
And I said to him, "Fine, I understand.

1465
01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:44.210
But, you know, in changing your mind
and deciding to do it,


1466
01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:47.250
you know, it really says to me
I have no future here."


1467
01:16:47.410 --> 01:16:50.730
EISNER: Jeffrey was a very good
executive. He just played it wrong.


1468
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:53.970
Had he been happy to stay at the studio,
stay in his job,


1469
01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:57.930
not push everybody against the wall
at a moment when somebody had died,


1470
01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:03.570
he would have gotten the job,
had he just had the patience to wait.


1471
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:13.530
HAHN: Whenever you're comfortable.
- You are rolling?


1472
01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:15.650
HAHN: Yeah.
- Okay.


1473
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:21.090
With all the many varied businesses
this company is in, it is...


1474
01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:24.330
The cast-and-crew premiere
was coming up fast.


1475
01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:26.450
It was tradition for all of us
to get up on-stage


1476
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:28.410
and give warm thank-you speeches.

1477
01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:31.090
But this time, I decided to film
all the speeches instead.


1478
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.970
--an unbelievable job
over the last decade,


1479
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:36.970
culminating in Lion King,
and pushing forward...


1480
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.250
Soon after,
Michael complained of chest pains


1481
01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:40.610
and was rushed to the hospital

1482
01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:44.130
where he underwent
quadruple bypass surgery.


1483
01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:50.530
All right, I gotta just--
Mind on other things.


1484
01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:57.770
Ten years after he ushered Frank
and Michael into the company,


1485
01:17:57.970 --> 01:18:00.210
and with Animation
at the height of success,


1486
01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:02.290
the wheels were coming off the car.

1487
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:03.890
You're not rolling, I hope.

1488

1489

thank you to everybody


1490
01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:14.970

on another marvelous movie


1491
01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:17.850
on the way to the next great movie.

1492
01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:26.690
Ten years ago,
when we arrived here at Disney


1493
01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:30.330
and Roy took Michael and I in hand

1494
01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:33.650
over to the second floor
of the Animation Building,


1495
01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:38.290
and with Ron and John, walked us through
those initial storyboards


1496
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:42.050
for The Great Mouse Detective,

1497

there's not a chance in the world

1498

that with all the imagination
I could muster


1499
01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:56.170
that I could envision ten years later
being here

and having the kinds of movies,
collaboration and pride


1501
01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:10.050
that I feel having been a part
of this extraordinary team


1502
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.530
called Disney Feature Animation.

1503
01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:20.370
For me, it is what makes coming
to work every day so special.


1504
01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:26.010
And to all of you, I'm not sure
I can ever tell you how much it means


1505
01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:28.970
and how much I love being part
of your family.

of these movies with the best in the world.

The human condition overshadows

1513

And it's about fear and envy
and jealousy and comfort

1518
01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:12.290
No, it was an organized group of people

1522

who did what to who,


1523
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:27.330
but they will remember the characters
who leapt from a pencil onto the screen


1524
01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.770
and into the hearts of the audience,
and that's how it should be.
