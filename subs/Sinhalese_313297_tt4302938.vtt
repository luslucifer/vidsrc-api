<i>If you must blink, do it now.</i>

3

10
00:02:24.807 --> 00:02:27.909
<i>His name is kubo.</i>

11
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:30.979
<i>His grandfather</i>
<i>stole something from him.</i>


12
00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:44.092
<i>And that really is</i>
<i>the least of it.</i>


13
00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:46.855
Ow!

14
00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:15.964
Well, hello, kubo!

15
00:07:15.966 --> 00:07:19.200
How is it today?
Wasn't a bad crowd.


16
00:07:19.202 --> 00:07:21.636
I got two pennies
and a lint ball.


17
00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:23.538
This is pretty good lint.

18
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.674
And what have you
got planned for today?


19
00:07:25.676 --> 00:07:27.509
Aw, you know.
The usual.


20
00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:29.177
Monsters?
Of course.


21
00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:31.613
You think you can work in
a fire-breathing chicken?


22
00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:33.782
The chicken again?

23
00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:35.617
The chicken is funny.

24
00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:38.553
A touch of comedy
to balance the whole thing out.


25
00:07:38.555 --> 00:07:41.890
They're gonna be
throwing money at you.
I just know it.


26
00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:43.892
Or they'll throw
something at you.
I don't know.


27
00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:46.327
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.


28
00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:49.631
And do you plan on finishing
the story this time, young man?


29
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.645
If you must blink, do it now.

30
00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:16.925
Pay careful attention
to everything you see and hear,


31
00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:19.194
no matter how unusual
it may seem.


32
00:08:19.196 --> 00:08:21.329
And please be warned:

33
00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:24.332
If you fidget,
if you look away,


34
00:08:24.334 --> 00:08:26.935
if you forget any part
of what I tell you,


35
00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:29.037
even for an instant,

36
00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.673
then our hero
will surely perish.


37
00:08:37.614 --> 00:08:39.881
Hanzo was a mighty samurai.

38
00:08:39.883 --> 00:08:41.516
But he was alone.

39
00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:43.518
His family taken from him,

40
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.420
his kingdom in ruins,

41
00:08:45.422 --> 00:08:49.424
and his army destroyed
by the dreaded moon king.


42
00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:53.094
You may recall,
hanzo was roaming
the distant far lands


43
00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:55.430
in search of
a magical suit of armor--


44
00:08:55.432 --> 00:08:57.465
the only weapon
in the whole world


45
00:08:57.467 --> 00:09:00.135
that could protect him
from the power
of the moon king.


46
00:09:00.137 --> 00:09:03.304
This armor was made up
of three pieces.


47
00:09:03.306 --> 00:09:05.573
The first--
ooh! I know, I know!


48
00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:07.776
The sword unbreakable!

49
00:09:12.082 --> 00:09:13.548
The second?

50
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.117
The breastplate impenaput--

51
00:09:16.119 --> 00:09:18.653
impenetrable.
Impen-a-truh-bubble!


52
00:09:22.793 --> 00:09:25.426
And finally,
the third weapon,


53
00:09:25.428 --> 00:09:27.796
the final piece of the armor--
i know this one.


54
00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:31.566
Pick me.
The helmet invulnerable!


55
00:09:34.004 --> 00:09:36.137
Before hanzo
could claim the armor


56
00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:39.407
and unite the pieces
to reveal their true power,


57
00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:42.510
he was attacked
by the moon king's beasts.


58
00:09:54.957 --> 00:09:58.493
Whoa!

59
00:10:13.944 --> 00:10:15.443
Oh, yes!

60
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:37.765
Kill the chicken!
Rip it to pieces!


61
00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:08.196
Oh, my!

62
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.550
Hanzo was filled with rage,

63
00:11:29.552 --> 00:11:33.321
his soul tormented by the grief
of a family stolen from him.


64
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:42.063
At last, our hero
was face-to-face


65
00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:44.465
with his Nemesis,
the moon king!


66
00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:49.704
Aah!

67
00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:58.579
So be sure
to come back tomorrow!


68
00:11:58.581 --> 00:12:00.248
Wh-what?

69
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.918
Oh, come on!
People like an ending.


70
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.154
Where are you going?

71
00:12:06.156 --> 00:12:09.324
No, you-- you can't--
you can't leave!


72
00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:30.678
Kubo... kubo...

73
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.015
Yes, mother.
I'm here.


74
00:12:35.752 --> 00:12:38.119
Hungry?

75
00:12:38.121 --> 00:12:41.422
And even though
he could barely see


76
00:12:41.424 --> 00:12:43.992
his own hand
in front of his face,


77
00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:47.028
hanzo and his army
of loyal samurai


78
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.097
pressed on
through the blizzard.


79
00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:56.170
And suddenly,
as quickly as it had started,


80
00:12:56.172 --> 00:12:58.873
the storm cleared before him.

81
00:12:58.875 --> 00:13:03.144
Hanzo breathed a sigh of relief,
for he was home.


82
00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:05.646
His fortress?
The beetle clan castle!


83
00:13:05.648 --> 00:13:08.449
Yes. At the very edge
of the far lands,


84
00:13:08.451 --> 00:13:11.519
hidden from the moon king
by powerful magic.


85
00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:14.355
And then what happened?
When he got to the castle?


86
00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:19.027
When who got to the castle?
Hanzo, my father.


87
00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:23.031
Hanzo--
hanzo was at the castle?


88
00:13:23.033 --> 00:13:25.500
He...

89
00:13:25.502 --> 00:13:28.336
Just give me a second.
I am...


90
00:13:28.338 --> 00:13:30.538
No, no, no.

91
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.541
It's gone.
I can't...


92
00:13:33.543 --> 00:13:36.677
Um... I'm sorry, kubo.

93
00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:40.982
Perhaps I c-- I could recall
a different story.


94
00:13:40.984 --> 00:13:44.719
Mother, what was father like?

95
00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:49.690
Oh, this one is easy.

96
00:13:49.692 --> 00:13:53.995
Hanzo was a mighty warrior,
skilled with sword and bow--


97
00:13:53.997 --> 00:13:57.165
no. What was he really like?

98
00:13:57.167 --> 00:14:00.835
When he wasn't fighting.
When he was with us.


99
00:14:00.837 --> 00:14:05.540
He was just like you.

100
00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:07.842
Like me?
Yes.


101
00:14:07.844 --> 00:14:13.581
Strong and clever and funny
and, oh, so handsome.


102
00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:15.216
Ugh! Mother!

103
00:14:15.218 --> 00:14:17.785
Come on!

104
00:14:17.787 --> 00:14:22.223
Never forget how much
he loved you, kubo.


105
00:14:22.225 --> 00:14:25.159
He died protecting us.

106
00:14:27.463 --> 00:14:30.731
Did the moon king--
uh-- your grandfather.


107
00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:34.368
Did grandfather
and your sisters
really kill my father?


108
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.305
It can't be true, can it?
They're family.


109
00:14:37.307 --> 00:14:39.307
No, they are monsters!

110
00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:42.643
Grandfather and my sisters
stole your eye, kubo.


111
00:14:42.645 --> 00:14:45.546
They must never
find you again. Never!


112
00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:48.082
You must always stay hidden
from the night sky,


113
00:14:48.084 --> 00:14:51.119
or they will find you,
and they'll take you
away from me.


114
00:14:51.121 --> 00:14:54.288
Promise me
you will never let this happen.


115
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.358
Promise me, kubo.

116
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.099
Don't be sad, kubo.

117
00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:09.971
Kubo, remember what
you must do, kubo.


118
00:15:09.973 --> 00:15:12.673
Remember?

119
00:15:12.675 --> 00:15:15.143
Keep you with me at all times,
Mr. monkey.


120
00:15:15.145 --> 00:15:17.311
A-a-a-and?
And...


121
00:15:17.313 --> 00:15:21.149
Keep father's robe
on my back at all times.


122
00:15:21.151 --> 00:15:23.417
Yes, kubo.

123
00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:25.520
And there's one more thing.

124
00:15:25.522 --> 00:15:28.623
Never, ever

125
00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:31.826
stay out after dark.

126
00:15:31.828 --> 00:15:34.929
Huh? Re-mem-ber.

127
00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:37.532
Yes, Mr. monkey.

128
00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:40.101
Good boy.

129
00:15:58.053 --> 00:15:59.520
Bedtime.

130
00:16:54.277 --> 00:16:57.578
Mother, wake up.
You're dreaming.


131
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.880
No. Kubo...

132
00:16:59.882 --> 00:17:01.782
Kubo, is that you?

133
00:17:01.784 --> 00:17:04.118
Yes, mother.
I'm here.


134
00:17:07.456 --> 00:17:10.458
Kubo, what happened
to your eye?


135
00:17:32.748 --> 00:17:36.083
Paper boy! Here! Here!

136
00:17:36.085 --> 00:17:38.286
Come on. Come on.

137
00:17:38.288 --> 00:17:41.889
Come sit next to me.
I got us a good spot here.


138
00:17:41.891 --> 00:17:46.460
What do you think?
I got myself all spruced up
for the big day.


139
00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:50.965
Mmm...

140
00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:53.401
I do so love the festival.

141
00:17:56.973 --> 00:18:00.574
You know, it's a shame
you never stay past sundown.


142
00:18:00.576 --> 00:18:03.744
There's fireworks
and singing and dancing


143
00:18:03.746 --> 00:18:06.347
and feasting, of course.

144
00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:08.616
But the best part of all--

145
00:18:08.618 --> 00:18:11.085
do you see those lamps
and altars?


146
00:18:11.087 --> 00:18:16.791
We use those
to speak to the loved ones
that left us behind.


147
00:18:16.793 --> 00:18:21.295
We listen to their tales
and guide their safe return


148
00:18:21.297 --> 00:18:23.130
to the blissful pure land.

149
00:18:23.132 --> 00:18:25.199
Really?
Did you speak to someone?


150
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:26.967
Yes, I did. My husband.

151
00:18:26.969 --> 00:18:30.171
His voice was
as clear and loud


152
00:18:30.173 --> 00:18:33.174
as the one you use
for your stories.


153
00:18:33.176 --> 00:18:35.676
In 72 years,
he never had a thing to say.


154
00:18:35.678 --> 00:18:38.179
Now he's gone,
i can't shut him up.


155
00:18:42.018 --> 00:18:45.219
You have someone
you want to talk to, huh?
Very much.


156
00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:48.456
Well, what's stopping you?
Don't I need a lamp?


157
00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:53.060
Well, I'll bet you could make
a really nice one


158
00:18:53.062 --> 00:18:57.465
with that paper-folding
thing you do.


159
00:18:57.467 --> 00:18:59.867
You see? Not just
a pretty face, huh?


160
00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:02.169
Now hurry along.

161
00:19:02.171 --> 00:19:05.406
Go! There's still time
before dark.


162
00:19:05.408 --> 00:19:07.141
Go! Get out of here.

163
00:19:40.675 --> 00:19:43.611
Place the lamp
at the altar.


164
00:19:43.613 --> 00:19:45.413
Very good.

165
00:19:45.415 --> 00:19:47.415
What do we do next, daddy?

166
00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:49.049
Now we pray.

167
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:52.386
We ask her spirit
to honor us with its light.


168
00:19:52.388 --> 00:19:54.388
Grandma, will you please honor--
shh!


169
00:19:56.192 --> 00:19:58.859
Softly. Softly.

170
00:20:16.244 --> 00:20:19.380
Hello, father.
I hope you're well.


171
00:20:19.382 --> 00:20:21.382
I mean,
i know you're dead,


172
00:20:21.384 --> 00:20:25.219
but I hope everything
is... okay.


173
00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:32.660
Look. It's your robe.

174
00:20:32.662 --> 00:20:36.163
Mother says I'll grow into it.

175
00:20:36.165 --> 00:20:39.967
She says you were a great leader
who died protecting me,


176
00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:42.603
saving one of my eyes.

177
00:20:42.605 --> 00:20:46.207
Two would have been ideal,
but thanks anyway.


178
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.779
Father, I'm worried
about mother.


179
00:20:51.781 --> 00:20:55.483
With every day that goes by,
she drifts further away.


180
00:20:57.152 --> 00:20:59.520
She talks a lot
about you, but--


181
00:20:59.522 --> 00:21:01.622
but I just don't know.

182
00:21:01.624 --> 00:21:04.825
I don't think she remembers
what's real anymore.


183
00:21:04.827 --> 00:21:08.762
I don't know
what's real anymore.


184
00:21:08.764 --> 00:21:11.332
I just wish you were here,

185
00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:14.268
so I could--
i could talk to you,


186
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.137
see you,
find out what I should do.


187
00:21:17.139 --> 00:21:20.207
Daddy! Daddy, she's here!
Grandma is here!


188
00:21:20.209 --> 00:21:22.810
Now it's time
for the final part.


189
00:21:22.812 --> 00:21:25.679
We have to help her get back
to the spirit world.


190
00:21:25.681 --> 00:21:28.315
But she just got here.

191
00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:31.151
Come on.

192
00:21:31.153 --> 00:21:34.188
Father? Hello?

193
00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:39.727
Anytime.

194
00:22:36.117 --> 00:22:38.085
Fine!

195
00:22:38.087 --> 00:22:41.522
I don't need you anyway.

196
00:22:46.094 --> 00:22:48.262
Kubo!

197
00:22:57.105 --> 00:23:00.274
I'm sorry.

198
00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:10.651
Kubo...

199
00:23:15.458 --> 00:23:18.058
Kubo.

200
00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.830
Little boy,
what happened to your eye?


201
00:23:22.832 --> 00:23:26.300
Who are you?
How-- how do you know my name?


202
00:23:26.302 --> 00:23:29.637
We're your family, kubo.

203
00:23:29.639 --> 00:23:32.239
Your mother's sisters.

204
00:23:32.241 --> 00:23:36.010
And we've been looking for you
for so long.


205
00:23:36.012 --> 00:23:40.948
It's so lovely
to meet you, kubo,


206
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.317
face-to-face.

207
00:23:46.756 --> 00:23:48.188
Come, kubo.

208
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.591
Come to your aunties.

209
00:23:50.593 --> 00:23:54.695
No reason
to be afraid, kubo.


210
00:23:54.697 --> 00:23:57.031
We just need
your other eye.


211
00:23:57.033 --> 00:24:00.334
Your grandfather
admires it so.


212
00:24:24.627 --> 00:24:27.394
Help! Help!

213
00:24:27.396 --> 00:24:29.997
Somebody help! Help!

214
00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:31.999
Look out! Run!

215
00:24:56.825 --> 00:24:59.893
We're here, kubo.

216
00:24:59.895 --> 00:25:02.563
Your family has come for you.

217
00:25:14.209 --> 00:25:16.276
Kubo!

218
00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:17.745
Mother!

219
00:25:23.952 --> 00:25:26.854
Kubo, you must
find the armor.


220
00:25:26.856 --> 00:25:28.922
It's your only chance.

221
00:25:28.924 --> 00:25:30.457
Remember this!

222
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.799
Mother!

223
00:25:38.801 --> 00:25:40.901
Aah! Mother!

224
00:25:40.903 --> 00:25:42.336
No!

225
00:25:44.572 --> 00:25:45.706
Mother!

226
00:25:59.587 --> 00:26:02.422
Kubo.

227
00:26:02.424 --> 00:26:05.492
Kubo!

228
00:26:05.494 --> 00:26:08.295
Can you hear me, kubo?

229
00:26:12.567 --> 00:26:15.068
I said your mother is gone.

230
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:18.071
Your village is destroyed,
burned to the ground.


231
00:26:18.073 --> 00:26:21.108
We landed here
in the far lands.


232
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.110
Your enemies
aren't far behind.


233
00:26:23.112 --> 00:26:27.848
We must search for shelter
before your grandfather comes.


234
00:26:33.254 --> 00:26:35.823
We need to go now.

235
00:26:37.091 --> 00:26:39.560
Come on. Get up.
Let's go.


236
00:27:16.364 --> 00:27:18.966
Once we're inside,
you might be tempted


237
00:27:18.968 --> 00:27:21.468
to complain about the odor.

238
00:27:24.973 --> 00:27:27.708
Keep in mind
my sense of smell


239
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.044
is ten times stronger
than yours.


240
00:28:08.449 --> 00:28:10.183
You have questions,
i can tell.


241
00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:12.319
Who--
you get three.


242
00:28:13.688 --> 00:28:15.756
I think I have more.

243
00:28:15.758 --> 00:28:18.458
Three. But first
you're gonna eat.


244
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.728
Why only three?
Okay, that was
your first question.


245
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:25.265
What? I don't understand
what's happening. Who are you?


246
00:28:25.267 --> 00:28:27.834
You don't recognize me.

247
00:28:31.739 --> 00:28:34.708
All these years,
you had to keep me
in your pack.


248
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.811
Well, now you know why.
But you were a wooden charm.


249
00:28:37.813 --> 00:28:40.747
You were this big.

250
00:28:40.749 --> 00:28:44.084
I called that charm Mr. monkey.

251
00:28:44.086 --> 00:28:46.954
And if I were alive
at that point,
i might've found that insulting.


252
00:28:46.956 --> 00:28:50.724
Look, your mother used
the last of her magic
to save you


253
00:28:50.726 --> 00:28:52.326
and bring me to life.

254
00:29:03.104 --> 00:29:04.905
Here. Drink.

255
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.275
Ugh!

256
00:29:08.277 --> 00:29:10.177
Smells.

257
00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:13.013
Everything in here smells.
Drink it.


258
00:29:13.015 --> 00:29:16.083
I don't want it.
I said, "drink it."


259
00:29:16.085 --> 00:29:17.918
You're a mean monkey,
aren't you?


260
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.454
Yes. Yes, I am.
And that's three.


261
00:29:20.456 --> 00:29:22.456
You're out of questions now,
so just listen.


262
00:29:22.458 --> 00:29:24.458
I'm here to protect you, kubo,

263
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.994
and that means
you have to do as I say.


264
00:29:26.996 --> 00:29:29.463
So, if you don't eat,
you'll be weak.


265
00:29:29.465 --> 00:29:31.098
If you're weak,
you'll be slow.


266
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.367
If you're slow, you'll die.

267
00:29:38.507 --> 00:29:39.873
It's too hot!

268
00:29:46.281 --> 00:29:47.614
Drink.

269
00:29:55.524 --> 00:29:58.458
Oh, excuse me.

270
00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:14.241
Okay, you better start
taking this seriously, kubo.


271
00:30:14.243 --> 00:30:16.843
This is real.
This is not a story.


272
00:30:16.845 --> 00:30:20.814
Those things, your aunts--
they never get hungry.


273
00:30:20.816 --> 00:30:24.684
They never sleep.
They will find you.


274
00:30:24.686 --> 00:30:28.321
And if we're not prepared,
they'll kill me,


275
00:30:28.323 --> 00:30:31.158
and take your other eye.

276
00:30:33.928 --> 00:30:35.762
What are we gonna do?

277
00:30:35.764 --> 00:30:38.398
We're going to find the armor.

278
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.867
It's the only thing
that can protect you.


279
00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:44.438
So it's real.
Really real.


280
00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:59.152
Don't worry.
I'm not going to keep it.


281
00:31:00.955 --> 00:31:04.925
I pulled that from her head.
I didn't mean to.


282
00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:07.761
Your mother
was very powerful.


283
00:31:07.763 --> 00:31:10.797
She blessed your robes
so that when the need was most,


284
00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.799
they would fly you away.

285
00:31:12.801 --> 00:31:16.103
She used the last of that power
to bring me to life.


286
00:31:16.105 --> 00:31:19.573
This bracelet, her hair--
it's a memory.


287
00:31:19.575 --> 00:31:22.309
And memories
are powerful things, kubo.


288
00:31:22.311 --> 00:31:24.311
Never lose it.

289
00:31:28.382 --> 00:31:30.217
One more question?

290
00:31:30.219 --> 00:31:32.219
Last one.

291
00:31:32.221 --> 00:31:36.056
Do you know where it is?
The armor?


292
00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:38.658
No. No, I don't.

293
00:31:42.997 --> 00:31:45.298
Now go to sleep.

294
00:31:52.907 --> 00:31:55.041
Good night, monkey.

295
00:32:12.593 --> 00:32:14.661
Kubo.

296
00:32:14.663 --> 00:32:18.131
Kubo, you were talking
in your sleep.


297
00:32:18.133 --> 00:32:22.202
You were dreaming,
calling out to your father.


298
00:32:22.204 --> 00:32:24.604
And-- and then the paper
flew out of your bag


299
00:32:24.606 --> 00:32:27.741
and folded itself into him.

300
00:32:30.211 --> 00:32:33.680
He's been standing there
for hours,


301
00:32:33.682 --> 00:32:35.849
quietly judging us.

302
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.055
I'm not even convinced
this counts as origami.


303
00:32:43.457 --> 00:32:46.660
I could swear
scissors were involved.


304
00:32:46.662 --> 00:32:48.662
Ow!

305
00:32:48.664 --> 00:32:52.499
Back home in the cave,
my mother's dreams did this,


306
00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:56.403
and the paper always
unfolded itself by morning.


307
00:33:06.214 --> 00:33:08.415
What's that about?

308
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.231
What are you doing?

309
00:33:29.237 --> 00:33:31.771
I guess this is how
my father answered me.


310
00:33:31.773 --> 00:33:35.041
Hmm. I'm tempted to say
that entrusting our fate


311
00:33:35.043 --> 00:33:38.178
to the guidance
of a small paper man


312
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.180
seems like a bad idea.

313
00:33:40.182 --> 00:33:44.351
But it's the best
bad idea we have.


314
00:35:04.932 --> 00:35:06.066
Aah!

315
00:35:13.608 --> 00:35:15.608
You're growing stronger.

316
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.044
You might not want to look
quite so pleased about that.


317
00:35:18.046 --> 00:35:20.280
We grow stronger,

318
00:35:20.282 --> 00:35:22.449
the world grows
more dangerous.


319
00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:24.784
Life has a funny way
of keeping things balanced.


320
00:35:24.786 --> 00:35:28.188
Monkey, do you ever say
anything encouraging?


321
00:35:29.457 --> 00:35:32.025
I encourage you not to die.

322
00:35:39.533 --> 00:35:42.202
"I encourage you not to die."

323
00:35:56.016 --> 00:35:57.083
Mm!

324
00:36:02.556 --> 00:36:05.392
Mosquitoes. Annoying.

325
00:36:28.682 --> 00:36:30.683
Wasn't me, I swear.

326
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.388
Paper runs out,
as does Patience.


327
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:36.990
I didn't ask them
to do that.


328
00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:40.293
The second time.

329
00:36:40.295 --> 00:36:42.061
I didn't!

330
00:36:42.063 --> 00:36:45.231
At least not exactly.
I mean, I felt it, but--


331
00:36:45.233 --> 00:36:47.300
magic is not meant
to be easy.


332
00:36:47.302 --> 00:36:49.269
You need to learn control.

333
00:36:49.271 --> 00:36:51.037
Concentrate on what
you're doing.


334
00:36:51.039 --> 00:36:52.772
And always remember:

335
00:36:52.774 --> 00:36:56.176
Don't mess with the monkey.

336
00:37:10.958 --> 00:37:13.927
Tread carefully, kubo.
This isn't one of your stories.


337
00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:16.563
How do you know?
Maybe it is.


338
00:37:16.565 --> 00:37:20.066
And I'm the Valiant hero,
and you're the mean monkey.


339
00:37:20.068 --> 00:37:22.335
Heroes come and go.
Any moment,


340
00:37:22.337 --> 00:37:25.038
something terrible could
come out of nowhere, and...


341
00:37:26.073 --> 00:37:27.173
Monkey!

342
00:37:27.175 --> 00:37:28.708
Kubo!

343
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:43.056
Monkey, wait!

344
00:37:44.091 --> 00:37:46.759
He wasn't trying to hurt me.

345
00:37:46.761 --> 00:37:48.928
He just wanted hanzo.

346
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.797
Hanzo?

347
00:37:50.799 --> 00:37:52.432
Hanzo.

348
00:37:57.538 --> 00:37:59.506
I still think
I'm gonna stab him.


349
00:37:59.508 --> 00:38:01.641
Why must you always
assume the worst?


350
00:38:01.643 --> 00:38:04.511
Oh, well, pardon me
for not trusting this giant,


351
00:38:04.513 --> 00:38:06.479
spiky insect-monster
that just kidnapped you!


352
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:09.215
Hanzo. Yes,
i remember him.


353
00:38:09.217 --> 00:38:12.051
I think maybe
he was my master.


354
00:38:12.053 --> 00:38:13.853
What? What did you say?

355
00:38:14.955 --> 00:38:18.258
We had a crest.
A samurai crest.


356
00:38:25.499 --> 00:38:27.534
Have you seen
this crest before?


357
00:38:30.237 --> 00:38:34.507
Ohh! This is a miracle.

358
00:38:34.509 --> 00:38:38.845
You have our robes.
You're wearing our robes!


359
00:38:38.847 --> 00:38:40.847
Why are you
wearing our robes?


360
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:42.849
He doesn't have to
answer your questions.


361
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:44.851
Anyway, who are you?

362
00:38:46.488 --> 00:38:49.489
Many years ago,
i was cursed.


363
00:38:49.491 --> 00:38:52.225
Trapped in
this cursed state.


364
00:38:52.227 --> 00:38:56.195
Cursed to wander the far lands.

365
00:38:56.197 --> 00:38:58.698
Cursed-- or "cur-sed."

366
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.001
No comrades, no master.

367
00:39:02.003 --> 00:39:04.604
Not even a name
or a single memory


368
00:39:04.606 --> 00:39:07.907
of the noble warrior
i once was.


369
00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:10.076
You used to be a man?

370
00:39:10.078 --> 00:39:11.778
No, not just any man.

371
00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.880
A samurai.

372
00:39:13.882 --> 00:39:15.949
I mean, I'm pretty certain.

373
00:39:15.951 --> 00:39:17.951
Look, I had the stuff.

374
00:39:17.953 --> 00:39:20.186
I'm either a samurai
or a really bad hoarder.


375
00:39:20.188 --> 00:39:24.524
Either way, inside my thorax
beats the heart of a warrior.


376
00:39:24.526 --> 00:39:28.528
If you have no memory,
how can you be certain
of anything?


377
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.730
Because i-
- I get flashes.

378
00:39:30.732 --> 00:39:35.969
They-- they come about from
objects I find on my travels.


379
00:39:35.971 --> 00:39:40.440
Sometimes it's a sound
or a smell.


380
00:39:40.442 --> 00:39:42.609
You must get a lot of flashes.

381
00:39:42.611 --> 00:39:44.611
But the memories, they fade,

382
00:39:44.613 --> 00:39:47.046
and all I'm left with
is the sense that I was


383
00:39:47.048 --> 00:39:49.983
once part of something
much greater.


384
00:39:49.985 --> 00:39:53.286
Monkey, can I tell him?
I really don't think
that's a good idea.


385
00:39:53.288 --> 00:39:55.054
He has a right.
Absolutely not.


386
00:39:55.056 --> 00:39:56.055
But--
no "buts."


387
00:39:56.057 --> 00:39:57.156
I--
no!


388
00:39:57.158 --> 00:39:58.257
What? Tell me what?
N-n--


389
00:39:58.259 --> 00:40:00.593
hanzo was my father.
Kubo!


390
00:40:00.595 --> 00:40:02.996
This is a miracle.

391
00:40:02.998 --> 00:40:05.064
I have found the son
of my master!


392
00:40:07.267 --> 00:40:09.302
Don't even.
Now,


393
00:40:09.304 --> 00:40:12.171
whatever brings you
to these lands,


394
00:40:12.173 --> 00:40:15.642
whatever your quest,
it is now my quest too.


395
00:40:15.644 --> 00:40:20.313
I will join you,
and I will give my life for you
if necessary.


396
00:40:20.315 --> 00:40:22.115
Wow. You will?

397
00:40:22.117 --> 00:40:25.351
What, do you think
that's possible?


398
00:40:25.353 --> 00:40:27.654
Well-- I mean,
i know how these quests go.


399
00:40:27.656 --> 00:40:30.523
People die all the time.
They drop like flies.


400
00:40:30.525 --> 00:40:33.126
That doesn't matter,
'cause I have a feeling


401
00:40:33.128 --> 00:40:35.828
this is my destiny.

402
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.330
No, it isn't!

403
00:40:37.332 --> 00:40:39.332
We can't trust
anything you say,


404
00:40:39.334 --> 00:40:41.934
because you can't trust
anything you say.


405
00:40:41.936 --> 00:40:45.038
We don't know
anything about you.


406
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.273
Monkey, you said it yourself.

407
00:40:47.275 --> 00:40:49.642
Our quest
is a difficult one.


408
00:40:49.644 --> 00:40:52.345
A samurai,
even a cursed one


409
00:40:52.347 --> 00:40:54.781
with no memory,
that looks like a bug,


410
00:40:54.783 --> 00:40:56.983
could be helpful.
Yes.


411
00:40:56.985 --> 00:40:59.886
I am certain
i could be helpful,
indispensible.


412
00:40:59.888 --> 00:41:02.455
In what way?

413
00:41:10.064 --> 00:41:13.566
Firing an arrow into
a wall is hardly
what I'd call--


414
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:19.005
impressive.
Oh, look at that.


415
00:41:19.007 --> 00:41:20.807
Literally the first time
I've ever done it.


416
00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:23.976
Just tell me of our quest,
and I will quickly demonstrate


417
00:41:23.978 --> 00:41:27.146
my numerous
indispensibilities.


418
00:41:27.148 --> 00:41:30.316
Well, that's kind of
a long story.


419
00:41:30.318 --> 00:41:32.985
You've got my attention.
I promise, I won't even blink.


420
00:41:32.987 --> 00:41:34.854
I actually don't think
i even can blink.


421
00:41:34.856 --> 00:41:36.856
Do I have eyelids?
Fine.


422
00:41:36.858 --> 00:41:38.958
Walk and talk.
Hanzo has found a path.


423
00:42:00.914 --> 00:42:04.083
So, you used to be
a toy monkey.


424
00:42:04.085 --> 00:42:07.620
Kubo, I really don't
see how this part is
important to our story.


425
00:42:07.622 --> 00:42:11.224
I kept her in my pocket.
She was only, like, this big.


426
00:42:11.226 --> 00:42:12.692
Okay. Kubo, that's enough.

427
00:42:12.694 --> 00:42:14.861
Tiny. And she was
called "Mr. monkey."


428
00:42:14.863 --> 00:42:16.696
I wasn't a toy.

429
00:42:16.698 --> 00:42:18.631
I was a charm.

430
00:42:18.633 --> 00:42:20.633
Of course you were.

431
00:42:37.118 --> 00:42:38.451
Aah!

432
00:42:41.922 --> 00:42:44.357
That doesn't look good.

433
00:42:45.392 --> 00:42:46.859
Don't touch anything.

434
00:42:54.334 --> 00:42:56.903
He did it.

435
00:43:15.789 --> 00:43:18.758
Okay.

436
00:43:25.933 --> 00:43:29.969
No, no, no,

437
00:43:29.971 --> 00:43:32.104
ahh!

438
00:43:32.106 --> 00:43:34.640
Yes.

439
00:43:34.642 --> 00:43:37.944
Kubo, look.

440
00:43:43.217 --> 00:43:45.685
The sword unbreakable.

441
00:43:45.687 --> 00:43:47.987
It could be a trap.
Mm.


442
00:43:47.989 --> 00:43:49.856
Allow me.

443
00:43:49.858 --> 00:43:52.158
What? It's not a trap
if you do it?


444
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.927
Stealth is my middle name.

445
00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.698
You don't even
have a first name.


446
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.533
Don't worry. I got this.

447
00:44:07.508 --> 00:44:11.010
The mighty beetle
is victorious!


448
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.740
Look, i-i don't got this.

449
00:44:40.742 --> 00:44:43.242
I don't got this!
Oh, for crying out loud!


450
00:44:43.244 --> 00:44:47.113
I invoke
the sword unbreakable!


451
00:44:47.115 --> 00:44:49.882
It broke.

452
00:44:49.884 --> 00:44:53.119
So, does it just mean
the handle, or...


453
00:44:53.121 --> 00:44:55.588
I'm a little disappointed
with this magic sword.


454
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.190
It's not the right sword,
you idiot!


455
00:45:03.463 --> 00:45:04.630
Look!

456
00:45:05.966 --> 00:45:08.267
The sword!
It's in his head!


457
00:45:08.269 --> 00:45:11.938
Hey! I've got a bone
to pick with you.


458
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.941
See, because
he's made of bones.


459
00:45:14.943 --> 00:45:16.809
You're an embarrassment.

460
00:45:18.746 --> 00:45:21.047
Uh, this is problematic.

461
00:45:21.049 --> 00:45:22.214
Aah!

462
00:45:30.091 --> 00:45:31.624
Enough with the arrows!

463
00:46:04.458 --> 00:46:06.325
Oh, foot!

464
00:46:10.263 --> 00:46:11.497
You can fly?

465
00:46:11.499 --> 00:46:13.833
Apparently. Yes!

466
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.894
Are you sure it isn't
the sword unfindable?


467
00:46:47.001 --> 00:46:49.035
I think I found it!

468
00:46:50.738 --> 00:46:52.905
A hand here! Anyone?

469
00:46:54.809 --> 00:46:55.875
Anyone else?

470
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.313
Kubo!
Huh?


471
00:47:15.362 --> 00:47:17.096
Kubo?
Monkey!


472
00:47:18.265 --> 00:47:20.366
Whoa!
No!


473
00:47:20.368 --> 00:47:22.234
No!

474
00:47:24.371 --> 00:47:25.371
Ah!

475
00:47:36.584 --> 00:47:38.451
Yes!

476
00:47:40.288 --> 00:47:41.787
Thank goodness that's over.

477
00:47:57.571 --> 00:48:01.207
Everything turning black.

478
00:48:01.209 --> 00:48:03.275
Then open your eyes.

479
00:48:03.277 --> 00:48:06.979
Uh-oh. I can't feel my wings.

480
00:48:06.981 --> 00:48:09.815
You didn't even know
you had them
five minutes ago.


481
00:48:09.817 --> 00:48:11.450
Stop wriggling.

482
00:48:11.452 --> 00:48:13.252
There.
Is that feeling better?


483
00:48:13.254 --> 00:48:14.820
Ooh, yeah.
A little to the left.


484
00:48:14.822 --> 00:48:17.423
Down just a bit.

485
00:48:17.425 --> 00:48:20.392
Oh, right there.
That's good.


486
00:48:20.394 --> 00:48:22.628
Wait.
You're being nice to me.


487
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:24.296
Shh.
Don't tell anyone.


488
00:48:24.298 --> 00:48:25.464
We did it beetle!

489
00:48:25.466 --> 00:48:28.134
We got the sword!

490
00:48:31.939 --> 00:48:34.507
Whoa, put that down.
It's sharp.


491
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.680
Ohh...

492
00:48:41.682 --> 00:48:43.516
Ooh. Ooh. Mm.

493
00:48:43.518 --> 00:48:46.152
Okay. We're done here.

494
00:48:46.154 --> 00:48:48.754
Get up. We have a lot
of walking to do.


495
00:48:48.756 --> 00:48:50.122
You can't be serious.

496
00:48:50.124 --> 00:48:52.424
I'm always serious.

497
00:48:52.426 --> 00:48:55.094
Are you two going
to fight again?


498
00:48:55.096 --> 00:48:57.530
Of course not. We're having
a grown up conversation.


499
00:48:57.532 --> 00:48:58.964
You're going
to fight again.


500
00:48:58.966 --> 00:49:01.200
Kubo, just go over there
and play with something.


501
00:49:01.202 --> 00:49:02.935
Not that!

502
00:49:02.937 --> 00:49:06.438
Monkey, this is
the long lake.


503
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.874
We can't walk around it.

504
00:49:09.944 --> 00:49:11.877
I can carry kubo.

505
00:49:11.879 --> 00:49:13.112
Carry kubo.

506
00:49:13.114 --> 00:49:14.647
That's your better idea?

507
00:49:14.649 --> 00:49:17.183
Look, I appreciate your help.
I really do.


508
00:49:17.185 --> 00:49:18.851
But when it comes
to the boy


509
00:49:18.853 --> 00:49:20.452
I know what's best.
Oh, is that right?


510
00:49:20.454 --> 00:49:22.788
And what's best is not
to be fielding ideas


511
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.123
from a talking cockroach.

512
00:49:24.125 --> 00:49:26.158
This coming from
a talking monkey.


513
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.526
I can still hear you,
you know.


514
00:49:27.528 --> 00:49:29.395
Then play louder!

515
00:49:29.397 --> 00:49:31.997
This conversation is over.
Monkeys don't swim.


516
00:49:31.999 --> 00:49:34.500
Not to worry.
Monkey see, monkey do.


517
00:49:34.502 --> 00:49:36.802
How long have you been waiting
to say that?


518
00:49:36.804 --> 00:49:38.304
Ever since I met you.

519
00:49:38.306 --> 00:49:40.372
Hey, what were we "grown up
conversation"-ing about?


520
00:49:40.374 --> 00:49:41.974
You're ridiculous.

521
00:49:41.976 --> 00:49:43.809
You're just
absolutely ridiculous.


522
00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:48.147
Ridiculous! Crossing the lake
is a ridiculous idea.


523
00:49:48.149 --> 00:49:51.250
It's not your fault.
There's no sense left
in your head.


524
00:49:51.252 --> 00:49:54.520
I think I resent that.
I may not know everything.


525
00:49:54.522 --> 00:49:56.188
Anything.
Anything.


526
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.390
But I do know kubo
is more capable


527
00:49:58.392 --> 00:49:59.825
than you think he is.

528
00:49:59.827 --> 00:50:02.528
You're being a tiny bit
overprotective here.


529
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.330
I'm being a lot
overprotective here.


530
00:50:04.332 --> 00:50:06.398
It's my job
to make sure kubo is safe


531
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.202
and that is not safe.
You! You are not safe.


532
00:50:10.204 --> 00:50:12.037
Kubo is just a child.

533
00:50:12.039 --> 00:50:15.074
And an incredibly gifted one.
He just saved our lives.


534
00:50:15.076 --> 00:50:16.742
Yes, he's very powerful.

535
00:50:16.744 --> 00:50:20.379
But he still has much
to learn.


536
00:50:20.381 --> 00:50:22.114
What?

537
00:50:25.852 --> 00:50:27.786
Well,
fast learner.


538
00:50:32.125 --> 00:50:34.293
Did you know
you could do that?


539
00:50:43.136 --> 00:50:44.703
Show off.

540
00:51:04.991 --> 00:51:08.394
Okay, now take
a deep breath.


541
00:51:10.064 --> 00:51:12.431
Clear your mind.

542
00:51:12.433 --> 00:51:14.466
Guess I got that
part covered.


543
00:51:14.468 --> 00:51:18.304
Now draw back slowly.
That's it.


544
00:51:18.306 --> 00:51:21.807
Close one eye.
Guess you've got
that part covered.


545
00:51:21.809 --> 00:51:25.744
Concentrate on what
is directly in front of you


546
00:51:25.746 --> 00:51:28.314
and let everything else
fall away.


547
00:51:28.316 --> 00:51:32.251
And... release!

548
00:51:32.253 --> 00:51:33.786
Ha, hey!
Yeah!


549
00:51:33.788 --> 00:51:36.488
Perfect shot!
Perfect shot!


550
00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.624
Not bad.
And what's your plan


551
00:51:38.626 --> 00:51:40.092
for getting the fish
into the boat


552
00:51:40.094 --> 00:51:41.393
so we can actually eat it?

553
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:49.201
Well, I said
i was teaching him how to shoot.


554
00:51:49.203 --> 00:51:52.838
Not fish. Fishing
is tomorrow's lesson.


555
00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.473
Give me that.
Whoa.


556
00:51:54.475 --> 00:51:56.108
Grabby monkey.

557
00:51:57.444 --> 00:51:59.411
Now try it.

558
00:52:01.147 --> 00:52:04.883
Pull back and...

559
00:52:04.885 --> 00:52:06.819
Yes!

560
00:52:06.821 --> 00:52:08.487
- Whoo-hoo!
- Mm.


561
00:52:08.489 --> 00:52:11.623
The rope.
It's a pretty good idea.


562
00:52:11.625 --> 00:52:14.193
Hm. And you're not
an awful shot.


563
00:52:17.064 --> 00:52:19.732
Okay. Now you two
are being weird.


564
00:52:21.368 --> 00:52:23.869
Um, we're going to
need something


565
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:26.105
to cut this with.

566
00:52:34.647 --> 00:52:36.615
Sword unbreakable.

567
00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:43.055
Mm.

568
00:52:45.525 --> 00:52:49.428
Mm. Mm. Mm.

569
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:52.398
Mm.

570
00:52:55.169 --> 00:52:57.603
Must you play with your food?

571
00:52:59.939 --> 00:53:01.573
Yes.

572
00:53:05.412 --> 00:53:06.912
What's the matter, kubo?

573
00:53:06.914 --> 00:53:09.548
You act like
you've never had a meal


574
00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:13.085
sitting between a monkey
and a beetle before.


575
00:53:13.087 --> 00:53:16.054
I've never had a meal sitting
between anyone before.


576
00:53:16.056 --> 00:53:18.690
Come on. Eat.
You need energy.


577
00:53:18.692 --> 00:53:20.426
And this is much better than
whale soup.


578
00:53:20.428 --> 00:53:23.529
Kubo, question.

579
00:53:23.531 --> 00:53:26.732
Before you started
on your heroic quest,


580
00:53:26.734 --> 00:53:28.967
what were your like?

581
00:53:28.969 --> 00:53:32.438
Well, I looked after
my mother mostly.


582
00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:35.941
And I told stories
about mighty warriors


583
00:53:35.943 --> 00:53:40.379
seeking revenge with battles
and monsters and magic.


584
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:43.315
I was pretty good
at telling them.


585
00:53:43.317 --> 00:53:45.717
Not so good
eat ending them.


586
00:53:45.719 --> 00:53:49.388
Sometimes I would tell my mother
stories about little things.


587
00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:51.490
Like skimming rocks across
the river


588
00:53:51.492 --> 00:53:55.794
or catching fireflies
in the mulberry fields.


589
00:53:55.796 --> 00:53:57.329
And when I told
those stories,


590
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:59.998
I could see her eyes
were mostly clear.


591
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.401
I could tell she saw me.

592
00:54:02.403 --> 00:54:04.636
Really saw me.

593
00:54:04.638 --> 00:54:08.407
I could see her too.
Her real self.


594
00:54:08.409 --> 00:54:10.476
Her spirit

595
00:54:10.478 --> 00:54:13.412
trying to find its way out.

596
00:54:13.414 --> 00:54:15.481
It was beautiful.

597
00:54:20.086 --> 00:54:21.286
You know something, kubo?

598
00:54:21.288 --> 00:54:23.956
Back when
you just told stories,


599
00:54:23.958 --> 00:54:26.425
before you went on
this great adventure


600
00:54:26.427 --> 00:54:29.528
you were still
very much a hero.


601
00:54:48.681 --> 00:54:50.883
We're going to have
to head for shore.


602
00:54:50.885 --> 00:54:53.118
Find a hiding place and...

603
00:55:00.727 --> 00:55:02.861
The second piece of armor!

604
00:55:02.863 --> 00:55:06.331
The breastplate.
It's down there?


605
00:55:06.333 --> 00:55:08.166
Okay, I got it.
Beetle, wait!


606
00:55:08.168 --> 00:55:09.735
No, don't worry.

607
00:55:09.737 --> 00:55:11.470
Beetles can hold
their breath underwater


608
00:55:11.472 --> 00:55:13.505
for a very long time.
What?


609
00:55:13.507 --> 00:55:15.974
Since when?
It's a well known fact, monkey.


610
00:55:15.976 --> 00:55:17.843
So you don't remember
anything at all


611
00:55:17.845 --> 00:55:20.512
but beetles swimming,
that's what sticks in there?


612
00:55:20.514 --> 00:55:24.416
No, beetle. My mother told me
a story about the long lake.


613
00:55:24.418 --> 00:55:27.419
There's something under
the water.
Oh, yeah?


614
00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:30.589
Um, what kind of something?

615
00:55:30.591 --> 00:55:33.358
She said there was
a garden of eyes.


616
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.728
Eyes that stare into you.
Into your soul.


617
00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.497
They show you secrets.

618
00:55:38.499 --> 00:55:41.400
Things to keep you
down there with them.


619
00:55:41.402 --> 00:55:45.270
Forever.
Okay.


620
00:55:45.272 --> 00:55:48.373
Well, I won't look directly
into anyone's eyes.


621
00:55:48.375 --> 00:55:51.176
Even if
I'm being incredibly Sincere.


622
00:55:52.512 --> 00:55:53.612
You're gonna miss me,
monkey?


623
00:56:03.189 --> 00:56:05.257
Be careful.

624
00:56:31.117 --> 00:56:33.752
He's searching for
the armor.


625
00:56:33.754 --> 00:56:36.054
Just like
his insolent father.


626
00:56:36.056 --> 00:56:37.889
Yes, sister.

627
00:56:37.891 --> 00:56:42.561
Then we must ensure
he does not find
what remains.


628
00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:55.941
Monkey, I think
he's in trouble!


629
00:56:55.943 --> 00:56:57.909
We should help him!

630
00:56:57.911 --> 00:56:59.645
Kubo, your aunts
are still out there.


631
00:56:59.647 --> 00:57:02.280
I'm sorry, but we have
to head for shore.


632
00:57:04.118 --> 00:57:05.717
Kubo!

633
00:57:14.995 --> 00:57:16.862
Look at this!

634
00:57:16.864 --> 00:57:21.667
I come fishing
and all I reel in
is a stinking ape.


635
00:57:21.669 --> 00:57:24.870
How pathetic that
this filthy creature


636
00:57:24.872 --> 00:57:27.639
is all that's left of
my sister's magic.


637
00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:31.343
This filthy creature
will tear you apart!


638
00:58:06.045 --> 00:58:08.146
Kubo...

639
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:25.597
Kubo!

640
00:58:27.234 --> 00:58:29.067
I have crushed creatures

641
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:32.003
who could fit this world
on their fingernail.


642
00:58:32.005 --> 00:58:34.840
This victory brings me
no honor.


643
00:58:38.244 --> 00:58:42.614
Imagine how you're going
to feel when you lose.


644
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:47.018
I felt loss only once.

645
00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:50.088
Eleven years ago
i lost my sister.


646
00:58:52.192 --> 00:58:56.094
She fell in love with a fool
and betrayed our father.


647
00:58:58.766 --> 00:59:01.900
She was an ungrateful coward!

648
00:59:11.778 --> 00:59:14.513
Who's the coward now?

649
00:59:26.626 --> 00:59:28.827
I got it! I got it!

650
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.266
Beetle! Wh-what happened?
Where's kubo?


651
00:59:34.268 --> 00:59:36.268
Um...

652
00:59:42.943 --> 00:59:46.344
Uh-oh!

653
00:59:53.085 --> 00:59:56.955
Get back down there!
He's in trouble!


654
00:59:56.957 --> 00:59:59.324
I got it.

655
01:00:11.838 --> 01:00:14.005
Mother. Mother.

656
01:00:48.341 --> 01:00:50.242
It never fails to amaze me

657
01:00:50.244 --> 01:00:51.743
how the creatures down here

658
01:00:51.745 --> 01:00:54.813
fight so hard just
to die another day.


659
01:00:54.815 --> 01:00:57.449
Down here there
are days worth fighting for.


660
01:00:58.885 --> 01:01:01.486
There is nothing down here
worth anything!


661
01:01:08.729 --> 01:01:11.162
It's pathetic what happened
to my sister.


662
01:01:11.164 --> 01:01:14.499
I looked up to her.
She was so strong.


663
01:01:14.501 --> 01:01:18.003
And love made her weak.

664
01:01:18.005 --> 01:01:19.437
No!

665
01:01:19.439 --> 01:01:22.107
It made me stronger!

666
01:01:35.688 --> 01:01:36.988
Ahh!

667
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:39.925
Over here!

668
01:01:39.927 --> 01:01:42.060
The eyes.

669
01:01:42.062 --> 01:01:45.196
It was the eyes.

670
01:01:45.198 --> 01:01:47.799
They had him in a trance.

671
01:01:47.801 --> 01:01:50.635
Oh, no! No!

672
01:01:50.637 --> 01:01:53.271
Come on! Come on, kubo!

673
01:01:53.273 --> 01:01:58.576
Wake up! Please, wake up!

674
01:01:58.578 --> 01:02:02.580
Please, please wake up.

675
01:02:02.582 --> 01:02:04.316
It's gonna be alright.

676
01:02:04.318 --> 01:02:07.252
It's gonna be alright.

677
01:02:07.254 --> 01:02:11.256
I'm here. I'm right here.

678
01:02:32.646 --> 01:02:35.513
I saw...

679
01:02:35.515 --> 01:02:37.649
What?
What did you see?


680
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:39.517
I saw...

681
01:02:39.519 --> 01:02:42.654
Mother.

682
01:02:42.656 --> 01:02:45.857
My son.

683
01:02:58.204 --> 01:03:01.573
So you must look more like
your dad then.


684
01:03:04.643 --> 01:03:07.979
You're staring.

685
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:10.715
Let me guess,
you have questions.


686
01:03:10.717 --> 01:03:13.184
Why...
I'll start.


687
01:03:13.186 --> 01:03:16.388
First question.
If I'm beetle
and you're monkey,


688
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:18.790
why isn't he called boy?

689
01:03:20.793 --> 01:03:23.228
Oh, boy.

690
01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:25.130
Questions can wait.

691
01:03:25.132 --> 01:03:26.664
We need sleep.

692
01:03:26.666 --> 01:03:28.500
Tell us your story.

693
01:03:28.502 --> 01:03:30.301
Then we can sleep.

694
01:03:30.303 --> 01:03:32.637
Please?

695
01:03:32.639 --> 01:03:36.441
Okay. Perhaps you can help me.

696
01:03:44.518 --> 01:03:47.485
The night
i met your father,


697
01:03:47.487 --> 01:03:48.820
uh...

698
01:03:51.023 --> 01:03:52.223
Mother?

699
01:03:55.929 --> 01:03:57.429
My sisters and I

700
01:03:57.431 --> 01:04:01.332
went to the temple of bones
to kill hanzo.


701
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:17.449
At the bidding of the moon king,

702
01:04:17.451 --> 01:04:19.250
my sisters and I had come down

703
01:04:19.252 --> 01:04:22.620
from the night sky
and killed many noble warriors.


704
01:04:22.622 --> 01:04:25.590
Your grandfather told us

705
01:04:25.592 --> 01:04:28.359
that any man who found
the magical armor


706
01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:30.128
would grow too powerful

707
01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:32.564
and be a threat to the heavens.

708
01:04:32.566 --> 01:04:37.268
That night I arrived at
the temple before my sisters.


709
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:39.737
And there he was.

710
01:04:39.739 --> 01:04:41.873
The mighty hanzo.

711
01:04:44.777 --> 01:04:47.445
"You have offended my father,"
i told him.


712
01:04:47.447 --> 01:04:50.381
"Now you must die."
Yeah,


713
01:04:50.383 --> 01:04:54.586
that's so you.
Beetle! Shh.


714
01:04:54.588 --> 01:04:57.021
We fought.

715
01:05:01.227 --> 01:05:03.995
Hanzo was strong.

716
01:05:03.997 --> 01:05:06.064
But then he stopped.

717
01:05:06.066 --> 01:05:07.732
He looked into my eyes

718
01:05:07.734 --> 01:05:10.835
and uttered four simple words.

719
01:05:10.837 --> 01:05:13.271
These words changed everything.

720
01:05:13.273 --> 01:05:17.675
"I love you...

721
01:05:17.677 --> 01:05:19.244
Monkey"?

722
01:05:21.413 --> 01:05:25.450
"You are my quest,"
he whispered.


723
01:05:25.452 --> 01:05:28.319
I had seen
the wonders of the universe,


724
01:05:28.321 --> 01:05:30.455
but the warmth of his gaze

725
01:05:30.457 --> 01:05:34.859
as I looked into his eyes that,

726
01:05:34.861 --> 01:05:36.995
that I had never known.

727
01:05:36.997 --> 01:05:39.464
It was his humanity I saw

728
01:05:39.466 --> 01:05:44.035
and it was more powerful than
anything in my cold realm.


729
01:05:44.037 --> 01:05:47.005
In recognizing his compassion,

730
01:05:47.007 --> 01:05:49.274
I recognized my own.

731
01:05:49.276 --> 01:05:51.042
I spared his life.

732
01:05:51.044 --> 01:05:53.211
He gave me mine.

733
01:05:53.213 --> 01:05:58.149
And-- and then he gave me you.

734
01:05:58.151 --> 01:06:01.186
But your grandfather found us.

735
01:06:01.188 --> 01:06:04.789
His rage at my betrayal shook
the heavens.


736
01:06:10.196 --> 01:06:13.631
Your father and his army gave
their lives,


737
01:06:13.633 --> 01:06:17.435
allowing me to escape
with you in my arms.


738
01:06:20.005 --> 01:06:23.174
Why does grandfather hate me?

739
01:06:23.176 --> 01:06:26.144
Oh, kubo.

740
01:06:26.146 --> 01:06:27.712
He doesn't hate you.

741
01:06:27.714 --> 01:06:31.416
He wants to make you
just like him.


742
01:06:31.418 --> 01:06:36.321
Blind to humanity
as I once was.


743
01:06:36.323 --> 01:06:38.890
Only then can you
take your place


744
01:06:38.892 --> 01:06:41.192
beside him as part
of his family.


745
01:06:41.194 --> 01:06:44.095
Cold and hard

746
01:06:44.097 --> 01:06:47.232
and perfect.

747
01:06:47.234 --> 01:06:50.735
I'll never be like him.
Never.


748
01:06:53.105 --> 01:06:54.439
I know.

749
01:07:05.084 --> 01:07:06.784
He's exhausted.

750
01:07:06.786 --> 01:07:09.787
Mm. Me too.

751
01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:12.523
I'm not tucking you in.

752
01:07:15.861 --> 01:07:17.729
You're hurt.

753
01:07:17.731 --> 01:07:20.265
Ow.
It's just a scratch.


754
01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:25.603
Monkey, why didn't you tell him

755
01:07:25.605 --> 01:07:28.439
sooner who you really are?

756
01:07:30.042 --> 01:07:33.211
The magic that keeps me here,

757
01:07:33.213 --> 01:07:35.446
it's fading.

758
01:07:35.448 --> 01:07:38.082
Soon I'll be gone

759
01:07:38.084 --> 01:07:40.418
and then kubo will
be alone again.


760
01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.555
Not alone.
He is the son of hanzo.


761
01:07:44.557 --> 01:07:48.493
I'll do everything I can
to keep him from harm.


762
01:07:48.495 --> 01:07:51.062
Thank you, beetle.

763
01:07:51.064 --> 01:07:54.399
To know kubo has someone
to watch over him


764
01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:56.934
when I'm gone,

765
01:07:56.936 --> 01:08:01.072
that would be a fine way
to end my story.


766
01:08:01.074 --> 01:08:04.676
Your story will never end.

767
01:08:04.678 --> 01:08:06.644
It will be told by him

768
01:08:06.646 --> 01:08:09.314
and by the people
he shares it with.


769
01:08:09.316 --> 01:08:11.616
And by the people
they share it with.


770
01:08:11.618 --> 01:08:14.085
And by the people
they share it with.


771
01:08:14.087 --> 01:08:16.487
And by the people
they share it with.


772
01:08:16.489 --> 01:08:18.323
And by
the people--
beetle.


773
01:08:18.325 --> 01:08:20.758
Th-the point is,

774
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.163
your story will live on,
in him.


775
01:08:55.027 --> 01:08:57.295
Hello, my young friend.

776
01:08:57.297 --> 01:09:00.565
Why don't you
join in my song?


777
01:09:00.567 --> 01:09:02.700
But how did you? You're--

778
01:09:02.702 --> 01:09:05.470
even blinder than you?

779
01:09:05.472 --> 01:09:08.706
Twice as much,
to be precise.


780
01:09:08.708 --> 01:09:12.744
Which means I see double
the truth. Mm.


781
01:09:12.746 --> 01:09:15.480
This is all a dream.

782
01:09:15.482 --> 01:09:17.382
Is this a good dream
or a bad one?


783
01:09:17.384 --> 01:09:19.650
See for yourself.

784
01:09:37.002 --> 01:09:40.071
My father's fortress.
Yes.


785
01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:49.013
The last piece of the armor.

786
01:09:49.015 --> 01:09:51.048
It's here?

787
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:54.352
Follow the setting sun
and you'll find it.


788
01:09:54.354 --> 01:09:58.289
In the place that might have
been your home.


789
01:09:58.291 --> 01:10:02.093
Claim your birthright,
kubo.


790
01:10:02.095 --> 01:10:06.164
Give this story a happy ending!

791
01:10:10.602 --> 01:10:12.637
Mother! Beetle!
Wake up!


792
01:10:12.639 --> 01:10:14.705
I'm up. I'm up.

793
01:10:14.707 --> 01:10:17.241
Well, I'm down. Mm.

794
01:10:17.243 --> 01:10:20.311
Off.
I think I slept on something.


795
01:10:20.313 --> 01:10:24.048
Sword uncomfortable.

796
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:26.083
The helmet.
I know where it is.


797
01:10:26.085 --> 01:10:27.819
I saw it in a dream, beetle!

798
01:10:27.821 --> 01:10:30.154
A dream?

799
01:10:30.156 --> 01:10:32.957
Well, that doesn't mean
anything in particular.


800
01:10:32.959 --> 01:10:35.560
I mean, I dreamt I fought
a giant skeleton


801
01:10:35.562 --> 01:10:37.128
with swords in its head.

802
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:39.497
That really happened.

803
01:10:39.499 --> 01:10:40.798
Oh, yeah.

804
01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.467
Beetle.

805
01:10:42.469 --> 01:10:44.368
Come on. This way!

806
01:11:21.039 --> 01:11:23.274
I spy with my one eye

807
01:11:23.276 --> 01:11:26.777
something beginning with "s."

808
01:11:28.614 --> 01:11:30.715
Snow.
No.


809
01:11:32.451 --> 01:11:34.485
Snowflake?
No.


810
01:11:34.487 --> 01:11:36.787
Okay. Oh.

811
01:11:36.789 --> 01:11:38.523
Snow-covered trees.

812
01:11:38.525 --> 01:11:41.192
Nothing to do with snow.

813
01:11:41.194 --> 01:11:43.361
How about serious?

814
01:11:43.363 --> 01:11:46.330
Stupid.

815
01:11:46.332 --> 01:11:48.966
Okay. I got it. Snow.

816
01:11:48.968 --> 01:11:52.069
He said it wasn't snow.

817
01:11:52.071 --> 01:11:53.504
It's a song.

818
01:11:53.506 --> 01:11:55.172
Well, that's not fair.

819
01:11:55.174 --> 01:11:57.742
How do you see a song?
You look.


820
01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:01.812
Golden heron.

821
01:12:01.814 --> 01:12:05.349
It's believed they hold
the souls of the departed.


822
01:12:05.351 --> 01:12:08.252
Carrying them over
to wherever they need to go.


823
01:12:08.254 --> 01:12:12.223
Hm. What are they singing?

824
01:12:12.225 --> 01:12:14.425
It's beautiful.

825
01:12:14.427 --> 01:12:19.063
Many say the song's about
what happens when we die.


826
01:12:19.065 --> 01:12:22.567
How we don't just disappear.

827
01:12:22.569 --> 01:12:26.203
We don't?
Ah, so what happens to us?


828
01:12:26.205 --> 01:12:28.906
Well, like
kubo's paper, we shift.


829
01:12:28.908 --> 01:12:31.108
We transform, so we can continue

830
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:32.944
our story to another place.

831
01:12:32.946 --> 01:12:37.348
The end of one story is merely
the beginning of another.


832
01:13:00.272 --> 01:13:02.373
I remember this place.

833
01:13:42.447 --> 01:13:45.716
This was where my father
prepared for his quest.


834
01:14:10.776 --> 01:14:13.010
There's something
i don't understand.


835
01:14:13.012 --> 01:14:14.945
Why would the helmet be here?

836
01:14:19.718 --> 01:14:21.018
Kubo!

837
01:14:52.585 --> 01:14:54.385
Ahh, release us!

838
01:14:54.387 --> 01:14:57.888
Oh, sister.

839
01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:01.525
I remember how
we looked up to you.


840
01:15:01.527 --> 01:15:04.662
Of all of us,
you shone the brightest.


841
01:15:04.664 --> 01:15:07.331
Such a waste.

842
01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:09.700
All we ever wished was to
be a family


843
01:15:09.702 --> 01:15:11.736
in our home among the stars.

844
01:15:11.738 --> 01:15:15.339
I think we have very different
definitions of family.


845
01:15:15.341 --> 01:15:16.941
Don't you touch him, you witch!

846
01:15:16.943 --> 01:15:18.876
And then there's you!

847
01:15:18.878 --> 01:15:22.379
The thieving insect
who stole my sister's soul.


848
01:15:22.381 --> 01:15:23.447
What?

849
01:15:23.449 --> 01:15:27.418
Oh, this is precious.

850
01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.386
You've been together
all this time


851
01:15:29.388 --> 01:15:31.288
and you haven't even realized?

852
01:15:35.961 --> 01:15:38.062
You took her from us.

853
01:15:38.064 --> 01:15:41.565
It was only fitting
we took something from you.


854
01:15:41.567 --> 01:15:44.602
How swiftly those memories
spilled from your head,


855
01:15:44.604 --> 01:15:48.539
wiping out all recollection
of your obscene union...


856
01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:51.842
Hanzo.
What?


857
01:15:52.978 --> 01:15:54.011
Hanzo?

858
01:15:55.447 --> 01:15:58.115
I... i-i didn't know.

859
01:16:00.753 --> 01:16:01.786
No!

860
01:16:07.059 --> 01:16:10.828
I'm forgetting what
i came here for.


861
01:16:59.611 --> 01:17:00.678
Mother?

862
01:17:16.528 --> 01:17:19.163
Shh, it's okay.

863
01:17:19.165 --> 01:17:20.998
I'm here.

864
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.934
Father?
My son.


865
01:17:28.807 --> 01:17:33.477
Seems I'm married to a bug.

866
01:17:33.479 --> 01:17:37.348
Yeah. A samurai bug.

867
01:17:40.886 --> 01:17:44.054
You are my quest.

868
01:17:44.056 --> 01:17:45.656
You always have been.

869
01:17:47.727 --> 01:17:51.028
Hanzo, keep him safe.

870
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:53.230
No matter what.

871
01:17:54.766 --> 01:17:56.767
I promise I will.

872
01:18:00.605 --> 01:18:02.806
Aahh!

873
01:18:05.744 --> 01:18:09.446
Oh!

874
01:18:09.448 --> 01:18:11.715
Fly home, kubo.

875
01:21:07.425 --> 01:21:09.526
Kubo, is that you?

876
01:21:11.897 --> 01:21:14.264
You have to leave this place.

877
01:21:14.266 --> 01:21:16.934
The moon king--
he's coming.


878
01:21:30.548 --> 01:21:32.783
Grandfather!

879
01:21:32.785 --> 01:21:34.485
It's me, kubo.

880
01:21:34.487 --> 01:21:37.287
I know you
can see me!


881
01:21:39.791 --> 01:21:41.925
Hello, grandson.

882
01:21:41.927 --> 01:21:44.928
It's so good
to see you at last.


883
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:48.065
So to speak.

884
01:21:48.067 --> 01:21:53.003
And I see
you found the armor.


885
01:21:53.005 --> 01:21:56.240
Seems your mother had
a reason to bring you


886
01:21:56.242 --> 01:21:58.742
to this dreadful place
after all.


887
01:22:03.181 --> 01:22:05.015
I see.

888
01:22:06.652 --> 01:22:10.020
I know you do.
That's how this all began.


889
01:22:10.022 --> 01:22:12.022
You finally saw me.

890
01:22:12.024 --> 01:22:13.757
That was my fault.

891
01:22:13.759 --> 01:22:15.759
I should've listened
to my parents.


892
01:22:15.761 --> 01:22:18.795
Hmm. Kubo,

893
01:22:18.797 --> 01:22:21.865
we both want
the exact same thing.


894
01:22:21.867 --> 01:22:23.934
You want to take
my other eye!


895
01:22:23.936 --> 01:22:25.169
That's what you want!

896
01:22:25.171 --> 01:22:27.671
Well, yes.

897
01:22:27.673 --> 01:22:30.674
But do you know why
i want it?


898
01:22:30.676 --> 01:22:33.844
Because
you're old and mean...


899
01:22:33.846 --> 01:22:35.279
And cruel!

900
01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:38.115
Oh, now, that's a little harsh.

901
01:22:38.117 --> 01:22:42.452
As long as you cling
to that silly, useless eye...


902
01:22:42.454 --> 01:22:45.889
You can't come up
to live with me...


903
01:22:45.891 --> 01:22:48.358
In the heavens!

904
01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.462
You'll be stuck down here
in this... hell!


905
01:22:52.464 --> 01:22:55.999
Staring with that lonely eye

906
01:22:56.001 --> 01:23:00.070
at hate and heartache
and suffering...


907
01:23:00.072 --> 01:23:03.073
And death!

908
01:23:05.911 --> 01:23:07.311
Where I want to take you,

909
01:23:07.313 --> 01:23:10.914
we have none of those things.

910
01:23:10.916 --> 01:23:14.985
It'll just be you,
with your family.


911
01:23:14.987 --> 01:23:18.388
Where you belong.
My family is gone.


912
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:21.091
- You killed them.
- No!


913
01:23:21.093 --> 01:23:24.728
They brought their fates
upon themselves!


914
01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:28.398
They disgraced me
and upset the order


915
01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.902
of everything!
That's how your story goes.


916
01:23:33.504 --> 01:23:35.939
Oh, kubo.

917
01:23:35.941 --> 01:23:40.510
When you're up there with me,
you will be beyond stories.


918
01:23:40.512 --> 01:23:45.515
You will be...
Immortal!


919
01:23:45.517 --> 01:23:49.519
You will be...

920
01:23:49.521 --> 01:23:51.221
Infinite!

921
01:23:51.223 --> 01:23:54.258
No. You're wrong.

922
01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:57.894
Not infinite.
All stories have an end.


923
01:23:57.896 --> 01:24:01.198
Is that right?

924
01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.334
And how does
this story end?


925
01:24:07.071 --> 01:24:09.206
I kill you.

926
01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:13.043
Oh. Very well.
Is this your wish?


927
01:24:13.045 --> 01:24:15.746
To do battle
with a hideous monster


928
01:24:15.748 --> 01:24:17.481
who ruined your life?

929
01:24:17.483 --> 01:24:22.319
To prove your worth,
like your doomed father?


930
01:24:22.321 --> 01:24:25.155
How mortal!

931
01:25:44.403 --> 01:25:47.304
You want to be human?

932
01:25:47.306 --> 01:25:51.608
Then share their weakness!

933
01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:55.879
Suffer their humiliation!

934
01:25:57.548 --> 01:26:00.817
Feel their pain!

935
01:26:00.819 --> 01:26:02.119
Ha!

936
01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.364
This is the end
of your story.


937
01:26:47.366 --> 01:26:52.302
Now take one last look
with that lonely eye.


938
01:26:52.304 --> 01:26:56.239
One last look
at this wretched place...


939
01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:58.642
You call home.

940
01:27:00.244 --> 01:27:02.746
I'm not leaving.

941
01:27:02.748 --> 01:27:05.482
For every horrible thing
down here,


942
01:27:05.484 --> 01:27:08.151
there's something
far more beautiful.


943
01:27:08.153 --> 01:27:11.154
My mother saw it.
So did my father.


944
01:27:11.156 --> 01:27:12.322
I see it.

945
01:27:12.324 --> 01:27:14.324
Even with just one eye.

946
01:27:14.326 --> 01:27:18.829
Then I'll just have to rip it
out of your head again,


947
01:27:18.831 --> 01:27:20.430
won't I?

948
01:27:22.935 --> 01:27:25.936
If you must blink, do it now.

949
01:27:30.007 --> 01:27:32.909
I know why
you want my eye.


950
01:27:32.911 --> 01:27:36.112
Because without it, I can't
look into the eyes of another


951
01:27:36.114 --> 01:27:38.448
and see their soul,
their love!


952
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:42.185
Everything you loved
is gone!


953
01:27:42.187 --> 01:27:45.622
Everything you knew has been
taken from you?


954
01:27:45.624 --> 01:27:48.625
No! It's in my memories!

955
01:27:48.627 --> 01:27:50.927
The most powerful kind
of magic there is!


956
01:28:03.442 --> 01:28:06.676
It makes us stronger
than you'll ever be.


957
01:28:09.814 --> 01:28:13.950
These are the memories
of those we have loved and lost.


958
01:28:13.952 --> 01:28:17.721
And if we hold their stories
deep in our hearts...


959
01:28:17.723 --> 01:28:20.123
Then you will never
take them away from us.


960
01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:35.472
That really is
the least of it.


961
01:28:55.693 --> 01:28:57.260
Where am I? Uh...

962
01:28:57.262 --> 01:28:59.896
Hello, grandfather.
Wha--


963
01:28:59.898 --> 01:29:03.533
hello. Wh--

964
01:29:03.535 --> 01:29:05.869
what happened to your eye?

965
01:29:05.871 --> 01:29:07.537
Don't you remember?
Oh...


966
01:29:07.539 --> 01:29:11.942
Oh no--
I'm sorry, young man.


967
01:29:11.944 --> 01:29:16.212
I seem to have
forgotten my story.


968
01:29:16.214 --> 01:29:17.747
Can you help me?

969
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:23.219
I'll tell him.
No, we'll all tell him.


970
01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:25.755
We'll tell him
everything he needs to know.


971
01:29:25.757 --> 01:29:30.927
You are the kindest,
sweetest man


972
01:29:30.929 --> 01:29:34.030
to ever live in this village.
Oh! Oh, really?


973
01:29:34.032 --> 01:29:36.766
- Yes.
- Uh, uh... every day,


974
01:29:36.768 --> 01:29:40.403
you walk around
smiling and handing
out coins to children.


975
01:29:40.405 --> 01:29:41.638
Like me!

976
01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:44.240
And old women.
Oh.


977
01:29:44.242 --> 01:29:46.743
You-- you taught
my kids to swim!


978
01:29:46.745 --> 01:29:48.445
What?
And...


979
01:29:48.447 --> 01:29:50.146
You give blankets
to the poor!


980
01:29:50.148 --> 01:29:52.115
You're as good man.
You fed the hungry!


981
01:29:52.117 --> 01:29:53.917
You always lend
a helping hand!


982
01:29:53.919 --> 01:29:56.086
You're a great example!

983
01:29:56.088 --> 01:29:59.756
Yeah.
Oh! It turns out
I'm pretty selfless.


984
01:29:59.758 --> 01:30:01.491
That's why we love you!

985
01:30:01.493 --> 01:30:05.495
You know, we have
something in common.


986
01:30:05.497 --> 01:30:07.631
We both adore
your grandson.


987
01:30:09.133 --> 01:30:11.801
His name is kubo.

988
01:30:11.803 --> 01:30:16.172
Mm. "Kubo"?

989
01:30:16.174 --> 01:30:19.476
I'm sorry, uh...

990
01:30:19.478 --> 01:30:21.711
But i--
but I don't remember.


991
01:30:23.314 --> 01:30:28.118
Well, your grandson's
a storyteller.


992
01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:32.489
He'll tell you
all the stories
you've forgotten.


993
01:30:32.491 --> 01:30:33.757
Really?

994
01:30:36.994 --> 01:30:39.329
Of course.

995
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:08.191
Hello, mother.

996
01:31:08.193 --> 01:31:10.393
Father.

997
01:31:10.395 --> 01:31:13.129
I know my stories can
tend to get a little...


998
01:31:13.131 --> 01:31:15.665
Mm, long...

999
01:31:15.667 --> 01:31:19.302
So I'll keep this brief.

1000
01:31:19.304 --> 01:31:22.706
I'm very grateful
I've had the chance
to meet you both,


1001
01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:27.310
hear your wisdom.
Feel your kindness,


1002
01:31:27.312 --> 01:31:29.579
even eat a meal
sitting between you.


1003
01:31:30.915 --> 01:31:33.717
This was a happy story.

1004
01:31:33.719 --> 01:31:38.755
But it could still be
a whole lot happier...


1005
01:31:38.757 --> 01:31:42.726
I don't know exactly
what the rules are,


1006
01:31:42.728 --> 01:31:45.161
or how this works,

1007
01:31:45.163 --> 01:31:48.698
but if there were
any way to...


1008
01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.836
You know...
I still need you.


1009
01:31:52.838 --> 01:31:56.673
So I could say this
has been a happy story,


1010
01:31:56.675 --> 01:32:01.177
or I could feel it--
we could all feel it.


1011
01:32:01.179 --> 01:32:05.081
And then we could end
this story together.


1012
01:32:48.592 --> 01:32:50.493
The end.

1013
01:32:51.535 --> 01:32:58.110
