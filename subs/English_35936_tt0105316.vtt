00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.583
Good morning, Nelson.

10
00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.506
How many times do I tell you
the same thing?


11
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.967
One day I'm going to eat
one of you kids.


12
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.010
Sarafina,
teach these children discipline.


13
00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:08.679
What is it now, uncle?

14
00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:10.514
Look at this monkey washing his
face with a jack.


15
00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:12.307
The jack is not for your beer.

16
00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:14.476
The jack is for
our morning tea.


17

( speaking indistinctly )

18
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.648
That's no way to talk
to children.


19
00:04:19.731 --> 00:04:22.359
The children are all
full of shit.


20
00:04:22.442 --> 00:04:24.027
You should stop spoiling them.

21
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:26.238
And you, Sarafina,
you're too full of yourself.


22
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.365
You're getting too big
for your boots.


23
00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:33.078
Sarafina Queen of Soweto.
Madam Beautiful.


24
00:04:34.955 --> 00:04:37.290
CHILD 1:
Sarafina, the sugar is finished!


25
00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:38.709
CHILD 2:
He took it all!


26
00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:41.044
I saw it!

27
00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:41.044
I saw that too!

28

32
00:04:50.804 --> 00:04:53.223
CHILD:
Sarafina,
I need a new exercise book.


33
00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:54.558
The teacher told me.

34
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:57.686
Okay. Tell him this week
I go to see Mama,


35
00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:01.023
I bring back money
to buy everything. Okay?


36
00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:02.607
MAN:
And don't forget my booze too.


37
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:05.110
SARAFINA:
Ugh, is that all
you can think of?


38
00:05:05.193 --> 00:05:08.405
( voices recede )

39
00:05:15.954 --> 00:05:17.873
Come on, Nelson.

40
00:05:17.956 --> 00:05:20.792
Why can't I be a star?

41
00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:22.878
What does a star do?

42
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:25.172
Nothing.

43
00:05:25.255 --> 00:05:28.091
Look at the camera. Flash!

44
00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:30.802
Smile at the camera. Flash!

45
00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:33.430
Look at everybody.
Big eyes.


46
00:05:33.513 --> 00:05:34.723
Say nothing.

47
00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:37.642
Stars don't do.
Stars just be.

In bed.

99

In bed, eh?

100
00:08:53.713 --> 00:08:55.173
Not running
around the streets


101
00:08:55.257 --> 00:08:56.508
and burning
them schools, eh?


102
00:08:56.591 --> 00:08:57.801
They burned the school?

103

Ah! They burned the school.

104
00:08:59.427 --> 00:09:02.430

Sarafina.


107

Just a little bit.
Nobody will know.


108

This is an act of
mindless vandalism!

It is madness!

115
00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:33.003
If anyone here is
responsible for this,


116
00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:34.504
I want to say this to you:

117
00:09:34.587 --> 00:09:36.673
why don't you blow up
your own brains?


118

The schools are
your only chance!


121
00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:46.182
If you don't want education,
do not come to school!


122
00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:49.352
Burn the schools,
and you have no future!


123
00:09:49.436 --> 00:09:52.689
If anyone is
responsible for this,

125

I don't understand you!

126
00:09:56.943 --> 00:09:58.820
I don't like
what you're doing,


127
00:09:58.903 --> 00:10:01.531
and I want it to stop!
All right?!

Yes!

Her classes will be
taken over by Mr. Puenin.

She'll be in the music room
after school today.


136
00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:21.009
Is that all right?

137
00:10:21.092 --> 00:10:22.552
Right, right.
Right, principal.


138
00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:24.512
All right. Right.

139
00:10:24.596 --> 00:10:26.431

Creation.

ALL:
Adam.


197
00:14:57.076 --> 00:14:58.328
Right, right,
right, right.


198

White.

White? Who says so?

201
00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:04.500
I never saw that
in the Bible.


202
00:15:04.584 --> 00:15:06.502
Did you see it in the Bible?
No. It doesn't say that.


203
00:15:06.586 --> 00:15:08.504
It says, "God created man
in his own image,"


204
00:15:08.588 --> 00:15:11.174
which means to be like him.

205
00:15:11.257 --> 00:15:13.968
So, what color is God?
Give me a color, people.


206
00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:16.179
Gold!

207
00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:16.179
BOY: Pink! Black!

208
00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:17.388
Silver!

209
00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:17.388
Green!

210
00:15:17.472 --> 00:15:19.891
Green! Green!
I like green.


211
00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:24.020
What kind of green?
Pea green? Sea green?


212
00:15:24.103 --> 00:15:26.189
Grass green? Olive green?

213
00:15:26.272 --> 00:15:28.191
Emerald green?
Jade green?


214
00:15:28.274 --> 00:15:30.526
Green as the dollars
in American wallets,


215
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.072
or green as the mists
on the hills of Kinchasa?


216
00:15:34.155 --> 00:15:37.825
God green, mankind green,
yes! I like it.


217
00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:39.369
So, what is the name

218
00:15:39.452 --> 00:15:43.039
of the first man
in South Africa?


219
00:15:43.122 --> 00:15:44.666
Right, right, right.

220
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:46.167
Nobody knows his name.

221
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.711
What's the name of
the first white man


222
00:15:48.795 --> 00:15:50.046
in South Africa?

223
00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:51.506
ALL ( in unison ):
Jan van Riebeeck.


224
00:15:51.589 --> 00:15:53.549
Date?

225
00:15:51.589 --> 00:15:53.549
ALL: 1652.

226
00:15:53.633 --> 00:15:56.552
History is so beautiful,
it makes you cry.


227
00:15:56.636 --> 00:15:58.805
( laughter and talking )

228
00:16:00.264 --> 00:16:01.933
Here is Holland.

229
00:16:02.016 --> 00:16:04.560
Here comes
Jan van Riebeeck in his boat,


230
00:16:04.644 --> 00:16:06.354
followed by lots
of other boats,


231
00:16:06.437 --> 00:16:08.356
and they're on their way
to the East Indies


232
00:16:08.439 --> 00:16:09.732
to fetch some spices,

233
00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:11.734
but they're passing
South Africa,


234
00:16:11.818 --> 00:16:13.236
and they know
that they're thirsty,


235
00:16:13.319 --> 00:16:15.238
so they stop here
for a drink.


236
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:19.200
Jan says, "hey,
why don't I stay here


237
00:16:19.283 --> 00:16:21.035
"and set up
a refreshment stop?


238
00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:22.245
"This way, it will be here

239
00:16:22.328 --> 00:16:24.080
every time you pass by."

240
00:16:24.163 --> 00:16:26.082
Good idea!

241
00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:29.252
So that's what South Africa
is for the whites:


242
00:16:29.335 --> 00:16:33.256
a gas station stop on
the way to somewhere else,


243
00:16:33.339 --> 00:16:35.216
a Pepsi and a piss
in the sun...


244
00:16:35.299 --> 00:16:36.426
( giggles )

245
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:38.094
And it's, "let's go, fellas.

246
00:16:38.177 --> 00:16:40.138
We can't stay here forever."

247
00:16:40.221 --> 00:16:42.765
But some of them did. Right?

248
00:16:42.849 --> 00:16:45.143
STUDENTS: Right!

249
00:16:42.849 --> 00:16:45.143
Right!

250
00:16:45.226 --> 00:16:49.272
You think children
would do a thing like this?


251
00:16:49.355 --> 00:16:51.733
Oh, yes.

252
00:16:51.816 --> 00:16:53.276
But why?

253
00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:57.280
Well, they're being used,
aren't they?


254
00:16:57.363 --> 00:16:59.657
You see, children
will believe anything.


255
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:01.951
A child will believe anything
an adult tells him--


256
00:17:02.034 --> 00:17:04.078
Father Christmas,
talking animals,


257
00:17:04.162 --> 00:17:06.622
Communism, anything.

258
00:17:06.706 --> 00:17:08.750
To me, a school
is a holy place,


259
00:17:08.833 --> 00:17:10.293
like a church.

260
00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:12.462
That's why I hate to see
soldiers in this school.


261
00:17:12.545 --> 00:17:14.088
Me too.
Leave the kids out of it.


262
00:17:14.172 --> 00:17:17.133
Let the men
fight it out.


263
00:17:17.216 --> 00:17:18.593
What about the teachers?

264
00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:21.095
Any rotten apples there?

265
00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:23.306
I don't know.

266
00:17:26.476 --> 00:17:29.645
MARY:
So now begins the great trek


267
00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:31.981
of 1836.

268
00:17:32.064 --> 00:17:34.317
The white boys
are looking north.


269
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.818
They say,
"what do you see?"


270
00:17:35.902 --> 00:17:39.071
"We see great land, men,
beautiful land!"


271
00:17:39.155 --> 00:17:40.323
"Anybody there?"

272
00:17:40.406 --> 00:17:43.076
"No. Just a few gaffers

273
00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:45.995
sticking spears up
each other's future."


274
00:17:46.078 --> 00:17:47.997
"So, what do you say
we make a trek?"


275
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.373
"Good idea."

276
00:17:49.457 --> 00:17:52.794
And what does this
bring to us?


277
00:17:52.877 --> 00:17:54.045
Shambucks,

278
00:17:54.128 --> 00:17:55.797
passbooks,

279
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.465
P.W. Botha.

280
00:17:57.548 --> 00:18:00.092
Afrikaans lessons, and--

281
00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:05.807
And democracy and justice

282
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.726
and very, very,
very fine schools, yes.


283
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.728
( laughs )
We're so lucky!


284
00:18:10.812 --> 00:18:12.313
Isn't history beautiful?

285
00:18:12.396 --> 00:18:14.690
ALL ( in unison ):
Yeah!


286
00:18:14.774 --> 00:18:17.985
( chattering )

287
00:18:34.752 --> 00:18:37.171
( indistinct chatter )

288
00:18:37.255 --> 00:18:40.216
SARAFINA:
<i>There's this boy</i>
<i>who wants to go out with me.</i>


289
00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:42.051
<i>His name is Crocodile.</i>

290
00:18:42.134 --> 00:18:45.137
<i>He thinks he's great.</i>
<i>But I like him--</i>


291
00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:47.557
<i>Except he burns down schools.</i>

292
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.725
<i>What's the future in that?</i>

293
00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:51.435
<i>He'll take me to the movies,</i>

294
00:18:51.519 --> 00:18:54.772
<i>and then he'll be</i>
<i>in prison for 20 years.</i>


295
00:18:57.316 --> 00:18:58.901
You don't
go in store.


296
00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:00.444
You stay outside.

297
00:19:00.528 --> 00:19:02.029
You don't hurt anybody.

298
00:19:02.113 --> 00:19:03.573
We hurt
the Boers' business.


299
00:19:03.656 --> 00:19:05.241
Hey! Burn the store.

300
00:19:05.324 --> 00:19:07.368
You want to hurt the Boers'
business, burn it down!


301
00:19:07.451 --> 00:19:09.704
It takes one man
to burn a store.


302
00:19:09.787 --> 00:19:12.206
It takes a thousand
to close it down.


303
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.749
We need thousands!

304
00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:16.252
We want the people awake,
alive, angry!


305
00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:17.753
That's it!

306
00:19:17.837 --> 00:19:19.714
They don't want angry,
they want quiet!


307
00:19:19.797 --> 00:19:20.923
Mama goes to church,

308
00:19:21.007 --> 00:19:22.258
Papa goes to the<i>shebeen,</i>

309
00:19:22.341 --> 00:19:23.551
the kids play
in the streets!


310
00:19:23.634 --> 00:19:24.927
Burn it down!

311
00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:26.721
They're not going to
get a quiet life


312
00:19:26.804 --> 00:19:28.306
so long as I'm around.

313
00:19:28.389 --> 00:19:31.100
( overlapping talking )

314
00:19:31.183 --> 00:19:33.769
I'm asking you

315
00:19:33.853 --> 00:19:36.939
to help me...

316
00:19:37.023 --> 00:19:40.234
for the sake
of the children.


317
00:19:40.318 --> 00:19:42.945
All it takes is
a few troublemakers,


318
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:44.780
but they all pay the price,

319
00:19:44.864 --> 00:19:47.283
all of them.

320
00:19:47.366 --> 00:19:49.285
So I want you to help me

321
00:19:49.368 --> 00:19:51.787
to identify
these troublemakers.


322
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:02.131
What is this silence?

323
00:20:02.214 --> 00:20:04.175
What does it mean, huh?

324
00:20:04.258 --> 00:20:07.762
That you don't believe that
there are any troublemakers?


325
00:20:07.845 --> 00:20:11.182
Or that you don't
want to help me, huh?


326
00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:12.683
Huh?

327
00:20:12.767 --> 00:20:14.977
You want us to tell you
who firebombed the wall.


328
00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:16.479
We don't know that.

329
00:20:16.562 --> 00:20:18.773
Maybe you know
some kids with bad attitudes


330
00:20:18.856 --> 00:20:20.149
cursing the soldiers,

331
00:20:20.232 --> 00:20:21.442
shouting, "viva Mandela!"

332
00:20:21.525 --> 00:20:23.527
Sure.

333
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:25.321
So tell me.

334
00:20:25.404 --> 00:20:28.115
All of them.

335
00:20:28.199 --> 00:20:29.575
That's funny.

336
00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:31.494
That's really funny, lady.

337
00:20:31.577 --> 00:20:33.996
Maybe there's some teachers
with bad attitudes,


338
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.998
teachers who teach
children to hate


339
00:20:36.082 --> 00:20:37.959
and burn and kill.

340
00:20:38.042 --> 00:20:40.002
To me, that is
worse than murder.


341
00:20:40.086 --> 00:20:42.672
That is killing
a child's soul.


342
00:20:42.755 --> 00:20:44.632
None of my staff
teach violence.


343
00:20:44.715 --> 00:20:46.300
That is not enough!

344
00:20:46.384 --> 00:20:49.178
Not for teachers who are
responsible for young minds.


345
00:20:49.261 --> 00:20:50.513
They have to
reject violence.


346
00:20:50.596 --> 00:20:51.931
They have to
hate violence!


347
00:20:52.014 --> 00:20:53.349
They have to tear it
out by the roots!


348
00:20:56.978 --> 00:20:59.522
We know there are people behind
this trouble in the schools,


349
00:20:59.605 --> 00:21:01.357
and we know
where to look,


350
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.984
and believe me--
Believe me,


351
00:21:03.067 --> 00:21:05.778
we're looking.

352
00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:19.417
( singing in
South African language )


353
00:21:43.315 --> 00:21:46.819
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
I'm here!


354
00:21:46.902 --> 00:21:48.571
Better late than never.

355
00:21:48.654 --> 00:21:50.031
Sarafina, Crocodile.

356
00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:51.866
Here today
is the plan, people.


357
00:21:51.949 --> 00:21:53.284
You will do all the work,

358
00:21:53.367 --> 00:21:55.786
and I go to sleep.

359
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.621
Have we got it
all worked out then?


360
00:21:57.705 --> 00:21:59.874
ALL:
Yes!


361
00:21:59.957 --> 00:22:01.584
Who needs a show?

362
00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:04.503
I sing a song,
everybody watches me.


363
00:22:04.587 --> 00:22:05.755
Song about what?

364
00:22:05.838 --> 00:22:07.256
SARAFINA:
About me! What else?


365
00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:09.383
MARY:
We have six weeks.


366
00:22:09.467 --> 00:22:11.260
Let's move it.

367
00:22:11.343 --> 00:22:13.095
Hey! Train song!
Stimela says!


368
00:22:13.179 --> 00:22:14.430
( cheering )

369
00:22:14.513 --> 00:22:16.599
( singing in
South African language )


370
00:22:16.682 --> 00:22:20.102
( laughter and drumming )

371
00:22:20.186 --> 00:22:21.771
♪ This is the night
For you and me ♪


372
00:22:21.854 --> 00:22:23.606
♪ Aiy yo yo yo ♪

373
00:22:21.854 --> 00:22:23.606
Hmm.

374
00:22:23.689 --> 00:22:26.192
And just where is
this train going?


375
00:22:26.275 --> 00:22:27.777
Just going, mistress.

376
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.737
At 4:00 in the morning,

377
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.906
Stimela takes the men
from their loved ones,


378
00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:33.282
and at 6 in the evening,

379
00:22:33.365 --> 00:22:35.117
the children are
waiting for Stimela


380
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:36.952
to bring back their
fathers and mothers.


381
00:22:37.036 --> 00:22:38.287
Stimela says so.

382
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.541
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Yes, I see. Hmm.


383
00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.835
So they come back?

384
00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:44.835
Sure, they come back.

385
00:22:44.919 --> 00:22:46.962
A happy ending.
I like that.


386
00:22:47.046 --> 00:22:48.422
ALL:
Mm-hmm.


387
00:22:48.506 --> 00:22:50.299
I love happy endings.

388
00:22:50.382 --> 00:22:52.093
You think of
a happy ending,


389
00:22:52.176 --> 00:22:53.761
and you've got a show.

390
00:22:53.844 --> 00:22:55.763
BOY 1:
Here's the story
with a happy ending!


391
00:22:55.846 --> 00:22:58.974
Killer disease
comes to South Africa,


392
00:22:59.058 --> 00:23:00.851
but only the Boers get it.

393
00:23:00.935 --> 00:23:02.770
( laughter )

394
00:23:02.853 --> 00:23:05.523
BOY 2:
Mistress! Mistress! Gold!


395
00:23:05.606 --> 00:23:08.776
We strike gold in Soweto,
and we all get rich!


396
00:23:08.859 --> 00:23:10.528
Jesus comes back!

397
00:23:10.611 --> 00:23:13.155
( laughter )

398
00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:14.698
Bah bah bah!

399
00:23:14.782 --> 00:23:16.325
( laughter )

400
00:23:16.408 --> 00:23:18.035
Mandela comes back!

401
00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.621
Yes!

402
00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:20.621
( cheering )

403
00:23:20.704 --> 00:23:23.833
MARY:
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!


404
00:23:23.916 --> 00:23:26.127
Day of liberation.

405
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.296
Mandela comes home
from prison.


406
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.340
I like that. I like it.

407
00:23:31.423 --> 00:23:32.716
I play Nelson Mandela!

408
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.677
The speaker
of the nation!


409
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.345
Why you?

410
00:23:36.428 --> 00:23:37.805
Because I'm a man.

411
00:23:37.888 --> 00:23:40.516
Okay. You want to know
who plays Mandela?


412
00:23:40.599 --> 00:23:42.017
Hmm?

413
00:23:40.599 --> 00:23:42.017
I play Mandela.

414
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:43.978
You are a girl.

415
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:43.978
So what?!

416
00:23:44.061 --> 00:23:45.396
MARY:
Sarafina,


417
00:23:45.479 --> 00:23:49.024
tell us what happens
in your story, hmm?


418
00:23:49.108 --> 00:23:53.028
The day Nelson Mandela
walks free,


419
00:23:53.112 --> 00:23:56.574
all the crowds, everyone
laughing and singing.


420
00:23:56.657 --> 00:23:58.659
Yes, Sarafina!

421
00:23:58.742 --> 00:24:02.371
♪ Free at last ♪

422
00:24:02.454 --> 00:24:05.040
♪ Nelson Mandela ♪

423
00:24:05.124 --> 00:24:08.460
♪ Walking down
The street of Soweto ♪


424
00:24:08.544 --> 00:24:10.921
Yes! You got it!

425
00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:13.299
And he speaks
to the people.


426
00:24:13.382 --> 00:24:16.218
Free at last!
Nelson Mandela!


427
00:24:16.302 --> 00:24:19.763
( cheering )

428
00:24:16.302 --> 00:24:19.763
Yes! Yes! Yes!

429
00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:25.811
Yeah!

430
00:24:28.314 --> 00:24:30.858
SARAFINA:
<i>Why can't I be you, Nelson,</i>


431
00:24:30.941 --> 00:24:33.068
<i>just for the school concert,</i>

432
00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:35.738
<i>just once make a big speech</i>

433
00:24:35.821 --> 00:24:37.406
<i>just the way you do it?</i>

434
00:24:37.489 --> 00:24:39.200
<i>Mandela free at last,</i>

435
00:24:39.283 --> 00:24:41.744
<i>everybody clapping</i>
<i>and cheering.</i>


436
00:24:41.827 --> 00:24:44.246
<i>Mandela's free</i>
<i>and I'm the star,</i>


437
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.874
<i>just for a day.</i>
<i>Okay, Nelson?</i>


438
00:24:46.957 --> 00:24:49.210
<i>Your day will come.</i>

439
00:24:51.837 --> 00:24:53.589
MARY:
Hey, Sarafina.


440
00:24:53.672 --> 00:24:55.758
Are you all right,
mistress?


441
00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:57.468
No, but what else is new?

442
00:24:57.551 --> 00:25:01.013
It'll be all right
in heaven, as they say.


443
00:25:01.096 --> 00:25:03.474
Is there anything
I can do?


444
00:25:03.557 --> 00:25:06.268
Just stay as beautiful
as you are.


445
00:25:06.352 --> 00:25:09.521
You know, I liked
your idea for the show.


446
00:25:09.605 --> 00:25:11.941
Mandela free.

447
00:25:12.024 --> 00:25:14.944
It would make a great show,

448
00:25:15.027 --> 00:25:17.029
only...

449
00:25:18.364 --> 00:25:21.909
Only they won't like it.

450
00:25:21.992 --> 00:25:24.495
No, they won't.

451
00:25:24.578 --> 00:25:27.289
So you're saying
we shouldn't do it?


452
00:25:27.373 --> 00:25:30.000
I'm saying
it'll make trouble,


453
00:25:30.084 --> 00:25:32.753
and right now they're
looking for the troublemakers.


454
00:25:32.836 --> 00:25:35.965
I know who the
troublemakers are, mistress.


455
00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:38.509
They get special training
how to kill.


456
00:25:38.592 --> 00:25:41.262
They have guns. 
I've seen them.

457
00:25:38.592 --> 00:25:41.262
Shh!

458
00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:42.471
( men talking outside )

459
00:25:42.554 --> 00:25:44.014
There's two of them.

460
00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:49.019
( Mary exhales )

461
00:25:50.229 --> 00:25:51.480
( laughs )

462
00:25:51.563 --> 00:25:53.774
( laughs )

463
00:25:53.857 --> 00:25:55.985
Hmm.

464
00:26:05.411 --> 00:26:08.289
The Boers want
everything quiet, right?


465
00:26:08.372 --> 00:26:11.292
Everything under control.

466
00:26:11.375 --> 00:26:14.169
Look! The keffeirs are quiet.

467
00:26:14.253 --> 00:26:17.298
A quiet keffeir
is a happy keffeir, man.


468
00:26:17.381 --> 00:26:19.216
But we are not happy,

469
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.093
and we are not quiet,

470
00:26:21.176 --> 00:26:23.929
and we are not under control.

471
00:26:24.013 --> 00:26:26.849
So somebody
better tell the Boers.


472
00:26:26.932 --> 00:26:29.560
People don't like
the boycott of the Boer stores.


473
00:26:29.643 --> 00:26:31.729
They say we only
hurt ourselves.


474
00:26:31.812 --> 00:26:33.731
People say? What people?

475
00:26:33.814 --> 00:26:35.357
People say, "do nothing."

476
00:26:35.441 --> 00:26:37.526
People say,
"what can we do?"


477
00:26:37.609 --> 00:26:41.113
People say, "please,
Mr. Boer, beat me again."


478
00:26:41.196 --> 00:26:44.491
I say, bullshit.
I say, fight!


479
00:26:44.575 --> 00:26:46.869
( overlapping talking )

480
00:26:46.952 --> 00:26:50.164
Okay, sure, fight,
but don't fight the school!


481
00:26:50.247 --> 00:26:51.540
What's the use of that?

482
00:26:51.623 --> 00:26:55.544
The great school.
The wonderful school.


483
00:26:55.627 --> 00:26:58.714
You think they put us
here for education?


484
00:26:58.797 --> 00:27:00.716
This isn't education.

485
00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:03.677
This is some way to
keep us off the streets.


486
00:27:03.761 --> 00:27:05.763
Miss Masembuko
gives us education.


487
00:27:05.846 --> 00:27:07.723
How long
do you give her?


488
00:27:07.806 --> 00:27:09.058
What do you mean?

489
00:27:09.141 --> 00:27:11.560
Open your eyes, Sarafina.

490
00:27:11.643 --> 00:27:13.562
People disappear.

491
00:27:13.645 --> 00:27:15.147
Haven't you noticed?

492
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.233
Mary Masembuko's
one crazy teacher.


493
00:27:18.317 --> 00:27:20.069
How long will they
let her alone


494
00:27:20.152 --> 00:27:22.738
to corrupt
our innocent minds?


495
00:27:22.821 --> 00:27:25.032
( overlapping talking )

496
00:27:29.244 --> 00:27:31.038
Sarafina,
I'll pick you up


497
00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:32.247
at your house later,
okay?


498
00:27:32.331 --> 00:27:33.540
What am I, your<i>pasah?</i>

499
00:27:33.624 --> 00:27:35.250
You're my girl!

500
00:27:33.624 --> 00:27:35.250
Uh-uh.

501
00:27:35.334 --> 00:27:37.044
What is it that
she wants, China?


502
00:27:37.127 --> 00:27:38.754
( speaking
native language )


503
00:27:38.837 --> 00:27:40.422
Maybe she's waiting
for Michael Jackson.


504
00:27:40.506 --> 00:27:42.383
I'm going to Pac Town
to see my mother.


505
00:27:42.466 --> 00:27:44.218
So? You coming back.

506
00:27:44.301 --> 00:27:45.594
Today it's
your lucky day!


507
00:27:45.677 --> 00:27:48.555
Treat yourself.

508
00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:50.891
You really do love yourself,
don't you, Croc?


509
00:27:50.974 --> 00:27:52.476
Sure, I do.
Why not?


510
00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:54.603
There's so much
to love, baby.


511
00:27:54.686 --> 00:27:58.440
So I'll come around
your house later, okay?


512
00:27:58.524 --> 00:28:00.484
You know, he's such
a jerk, that one,


513
00:28:00.567 --> 00:28:02.236
I almost like him.

514
00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:04.238
What is it that
you want, Sarafina?


515
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:07.157
China,
you know how it is.


516
00:28:07.241 --> 00:28:09.576
I want more.

517
00:28:07.241 --> 00:28:09.576
More what?

518
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.787
More than this.

519
00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:18.877
( muffled announcement
over P.A. System )


520
00:28:28.887 --> 00:28:30.848
This store
is owned by Boers.


521
00:28:32.391 --> 00:28:34.184
We have to support
each other!


522
00:28:35.936 --> 00:28:38.480
Don't give your money
to the Boers.


523
00:28:38.564 --> 00:28:41.150
There's no law that says
you have to show up here.


524
00:28:41.233 --> 00:28:44.153
( rumbles )

525
00:28:41.233 --> 00:28:44.153
( brakes screech )

526
00:28:44.236 --> 00:28:45.654
Boycott the Boers!

527
00:28:45.737 --> 00:28:47.990
( overlapping yelling,
singing, and shouting )


528
00:28:50.075 --> 00:28:52.870
Hey! Hey! Shut up!

529
00:28:52.953 --> 00:28:54.663
You go home.

530
00:28:54.746 --> 00:28:57.583
What's all this fooling
with other people's business?


531
00:28:57.666 --> 00:28:58.959
Why do you show up here,
Mama?


532
00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:00.502
Because I want to,

533
00:29:00.586 --> 00:29:02.463
and I'm not your mama.
Now, out of my way!


534
00:29:02.546 --> 00:29:04.673
You want to give
your money to the Boers?


535
00:29:04.756 --> 00:29:06.467
You want to help them
and not your own people?


536
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.885
You get out of my way!

537
00:29:07.968 --> 00:29:09.678
You boys don't help no one!

538
00:29:09.761 --> 00:29:11.346
All you do is
make things bad!


539
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.890
What's your daddy doing,

540
00:29:12.973 --> 00:29:14.391
letting you run wild
like this?


541
00:29:14.475 --> 00:29:16.810
My daddy is doing
the same as you: nothing!


542
00:29:16.894 --> 00:29:18.353
That's right!

543
00:29:18.437 --> 00:29:19.813
That's why nothing changes,
mama!


544
00:29:21.106 --> 00:29:23.442
Leave my sugar!
Leave my sugar!


545
00:29:23.525 --> 00:29:25.694
( rumbling )

546
00:29:27.112 --> 00:29:28.864
( indistinct talking )

547
00:29:28.947 --> 00:29:31.408
SARAFINA:
<i>I want to tell you something,</i>
<i>Nelson,</i>


548
00:29:31.492 --> 00:29:33.744
<i>I can't tell anyone else.</i>

549
00:29:33.827 --> 00:29:36.205
<i>Whenever I go</i>
<i>to visit my mother,</i>


550
00:29:36.288 --> 00:29:38.999
<i>I feel like I'm visiting</i>
<i>another world</i>


551
00:29:39.082 --> 00:29:41.084
<i>and that I don't</i>
<i>belong there.</i>


552
00:29:41.168 --> 00:29:43.253
<i>That's a bad feeling, right?</i>

553
00:29:43.337 --> 00:29:45.839
<i>I feel like I belong</i>
<i>somewhere else,</i>


554
00:29:45.923 --> 00:29:48.467
<i>somewhere</i>
<i>I've not even seen yet,</i>


555
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.886
<i>but I'll know it</i>
<i>when I see it.</i>


556
00:29:50.969 --> 00:29:53.096
( siren wailing )

557
00:29:56.058 --> 00:29:59.394
( yelling and screaming )

558
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.924
<i>This other world</i>
<i>is called Pac Town.</i>


559
00:30:29.007 --> 00:30:31.760
<i>They keep the streets</i>
<i>very clean in Pac Town.</i>


560
00:30:31.843 --> 00:30:34.221
<i>Mama lives</i>
<i>in a big white house.</i>


561
00:30:34.304 --> 00:30:37.015
<i>Well, in a small room</i>
<i>in the back, really.</i>


562
00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:38.976
<i>But they treat her well.</i>

563
00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:43.021
<i>They say, "oh, Angelina's</i>
<i>just like one of the family."</i>


564
00:30:43.105 --> 00:30:45.274
<i>"The children just love her.</i>

565
00:30:45.357 --> 00:30:48.110
<i>You know how good these</i>
<i>black women are with children."</i>


566
00:30:48.193 --> 00:30:49.444
<i>They're right.</i>

567
00:30:49.528 --> 00:30:51.446
<i>Mama is good with children.</i>

568
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.616
<i>Only her children</i>
<i>don't live here, do they?</i>


569
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.201
Hello.

570
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.201
Hi.

571
00:30:56.285 --> 00:30:57.452
How are you?

572
00:30:56.285 --> 00:30:57.452
I'm fine.

573
00:30:57.536 --> 00:30:59.329
Good.

574
00:31:13.844 --> 00:31:16.138
( humming )

575
00:31:22.394 --> 00:31:25.147
Mama.

576
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.108
Sarafina.

577
00:31:32.529 --> 00:31:34.156
How are my babies?

578
00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:36.283
Jabu is as naughty
as always.


579
00:31:36.366 --> 00:31:38.535
But everyone's fine,
Mama.


580
00:31:38.619 --> 00:31:41.455
Mama,
I need some money.


581
00:31:41.538 --> 00:31:44.291
Lindiwe has to
have new shoes.


582
00:31:44.374 --> 00:31:46.168
They split.

583
00:31:46.251 --> 00:31:49.671
They're no good.

584
00:31:49.755 --> 00:31:51.632
Have the Boers gone away?

585
00:31:51.715 --> 00:31:55.510
Yes.
Just for the afternoon.


586
00:31:55.594 --> 00:31:57.846
How much money
do you want?


587
00:31:57.929 --> 00:31:59.723
Sarafina!

588
00:31:59.806 --> 00:32:02.476
Sarafina!

589
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:04.519
Where do you think
you are going?


590
00:32:04.603 --> 00:32:06.063
Sarafina!

591
00:32:06.146 --> 00:32:08.231
Sarafina,
come back here!


592
00:32:08.315 --> 00:32:11.526
A little refreshment,
Mrs. Vandermoever.


593
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.695
The maid
will take your coat.


594
00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:16.573
Gin, brandy, rum?

595
00:32:16.657 --> 00:32:18.533
Or perhaps you would
like the maid


596
00:32:18.617 --> 00:32:21.620
to mix you
a refreshing lemonade?


597
00:32:21.703 --> 00:32:24.247
Do sit down,
Mrs. Vandermoever.


598
00:32:24.331 --> 00:32:27.542
You walked all the way
from the front gate


599
00:32:27.626 --> 00:32:29.503
on your own legs.

600
00:32:29.586 --> 00:32:32.381
Huh! You must be exhausted.

601
00:32:32.464 --> 00:32:35.217
Next time,
you wait by the gate,


602
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.052
and the maid
will carry you.


603
00:32:37.135 --> 00:32:38.887
No problem, my dear.

604
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.390
These black women
are so strong.


605
00:32:41.473 --> 00:32:44.351
That's enough, Sarafina!

606
00:32:44.434 --> 00:32:47.396
Sometimes you're such
a naughty little girl.


607
00:32:48.814 --> 00:32:50.399
Sarafina!

608
00:32:50.482 --> 00:32:53.193
Sarafina, where
are you going now?


609
00:32:53.276 --> 00:32:55.195
( humming )

610
00:32:58.156 --> 00:32:59.408
Whoo!

611
00:33:03.036 --> 00:33:06.331
Get off that bed,
you silly girl!


612
00:33:07.999 --> 00:33:12.421
Sarafina,
come back here!


613
00:33:12.504 --> 00:33:14.297
What's the matter
with you anyway?


614
00:33:14.381 --> 00:33:15.674
Have you gone crazy?

615
00:33:15.757 --> 00:33:16.967
Yes, I've gone crazy.

616
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.427
You want me
to lose my job?


617
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:19.886
Yes.

618
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.388
And who's gonna buy
your school books?


619
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:23.765
School books
are full of lies.


620
00:33:31.022 --> 00:33:33.316
You're a stupid girl,
Sarafina.


621
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.569
Get off that bed
and show some sense.


622
00:33:35.652 --> 00:33:36.945
I want to kill them.

623
00:33:37.028 --> 00:33:38.947
Kill them? What for?

624
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.741
They are good people.

625
00:33:40.824 --> 00:33:43.827
You've been a servant
for too long, Mama.


626
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.955
Maybe that's because
your papa's been dead too long.


627
00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:49.124
Papa died fighting.

628
00:33:49.207 --> 00:33:50.459
He did not die fighting.

629
00:33:50.542 --> 00:33:52.836
He got sick in Mozambique,
and he died.


630
00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:54.463
He died for the struggle.

631
00:33:54.546 --> 00:33:57.340
Oh, sure. He went away
to be a hero,


632
00:33:57.424 --> 00:34:00.302
and I stayed home to work.

633
00:34:00.385 --> 00:34:02.345
Don't talk like that.

634
00:34:02.429 --> 00:34:04.973
I've got four children
and no man.


635
00:34:05.056 --> 00:34:07.434
My children
cannot eat glory.


636
00:34:07.517 --> 00:34:09.478
We eat servant food.

637
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:11.646
Food is food.
You want to starve?


638
00:34:12.898 --> 00:34:14.483
Maybe.

639
00:34:14.566 --> 00:34:15.984
The way you're going on,

640
00:34:16.067 --> 00:34:18.487
you just might end up
dead like your papa.


641
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.740
I'd rather die like him
than live like you.


642
00:34:23.784 --> 00:34:26.578
I've got work to do.

643
00:34:32.918 --> 00:34:35.086
( man shouting,
boy screaming )


644
00:34:38.298 --> 00:34:40.550
( indistinct shouting
and screaming )


645
00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.556
( laughs )

646
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.016
I'm not your brother, okay?

647
00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:49.851
I'm not your brother.

648
00:34:49.935 --> 00:34:51.561
( screaming )

649
00:34:51.645 --> 00:34:54.523
Eh, who's paying you?
I'm not your brother!


650
00:34:54.606 --> 00:34:57.234
I'm not your brother!

651
00:34:57.317 --> 00:34:59.027
MAN: Sabela!

652
00:34:57.317 --> 00:34:59.027
Yes, sir!

653
00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.403
Give him Prince.

654
00:35:00.487 --> 00:35:01.863
Thank you, sir.

655
00:35:01.947 --> 00:35:04.407
( boy screaming )

656
00:35:06.409 --> 00:35:08.370
( dog barking )

657
00:35:08.453 --> 00:35:09.830
Sic 'im! Sic 'im!

658
00:35:09.913 --> 00:35:11.206
Go, Prince!

659
00:35:11.289 --> 00:35:13.708
( dog barking )

660
00:35:13.792 --> 00:35:16.169
( men laughing )

661
00:35:20.257 --> 00:35:21.675
( dog growling )

662
00:35:21.758 --> 00:35:26.346
( screaming )

663
00:35:26.429 --> 00:35:29.724
Go on! Go on!

664
00:35:29.808 --> 00:35:30.934
Aah! Aah!

665
00:35:31.017 --> 00:35:32.936
Aah! Aah!

666
00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:35.605
( dog barking )

667
00:35:35.689 --> 00:35:36.898
( shouting
in native language )


668
00:35:36.982 --> 00:35:39.401
Ha, ha, ha!

669
00:35:36.982 --> 00:35:39.401
( dog barking )

670
00:36:01.172 --> 00:36:02.883
( knocks on door )

671
00:36:04.175 --> 00:36:05.886
( knocking )

672
00:36:11.683 --> 00:36:13.810
Unh!

673
00:36:15.562 --> 00:36:18.273
It was Sabela.

674
00:36:18.356 --> 00:36:20.400
They set a dog on me.

675
00:36:20.483 --> 00:36:22.402
Our time will come.

676
00:36:22.485 --> 00:36:24.779
I'll kill him!

677
00:36:24.863 --> 00:36:26.781
And his bloody dog.

678
00:36:26.865 --> 00:36:28.742
No need for killing.

679
00:36:28.825 --> 00:36:30.619
When the people rise up,

680
00:36:30.702 --> 00:36:32.787
you'll see him
singing a new song...


681
00:36:32.871 --> 00:36:35.957
when they march down
commissioner street like a sea,


682
00:36:36.041 --> 00:36:39.628
Constable Sabela will shit
himself with fear,


683
00:36:39.711 --> 00:36:43.089
and up will go his fist.
"viva, Mandela, viva."


684
00:36:43.173 --> 00:36:46.468
Oh, man, I'd love
to see that.


685
00:36:46.551 --> 00:36:48.929
(<i>singing in native language</i> )

686
00:38:09.968 --> 00:38:12.345
( indistinct chatter )

687
00:38:24.482 --> 00:38:25.942
( man whistles )

688
00:38:30.488 --> 00:38:31.865
( wolf whistle )

689
00:38:31.948 --> 00:38:33.408
( knocking )

690
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:39.873
( knocking )

691
00:38:45.503 --> 00:38:47.630
Miss Masembuko?

692
00:38:54.137 --> 00:38:56.431
Sarafina.

693
00:39:09.527 --> 00:39:11.112
Come in.

694
00:39:11.196 --> 00:39:12.614
Give me a moment, okay?

695
00:39:12.697 --> 00:39:14.532
Okay.

696
00:39:21.456 --> 00:39:25.126
( whispering )

697
00:39:30.215 --> 00:39:31.424
I love you.

698
00:39:31.508 --> 00:39:33.510
MARY:
I love you too.


699
00:39:37.555 --> 00:39:40.558
Ow! Ooh!

700
00:39:40.642 --> 00:39:41.810
Aah.

701
00:39:41.893 --> 00:39:43.686
All right.

702
00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.563
Please.
Okay. Okay.


703
00:40:04.374 --> 00:40:05.792
Next week?

704
00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:08.336
I love you too. Okay.

705
00:40:08.419 --> 00:40:12.215
Go, go.
Okay. Bye.


706
00:40:13.424 --> 00:40:15.135
Bye.

707
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.351
What happened?

708
00:40:23.434 --> 00:40:24.602
The water spilled.

709
00:40:24.686 --> 00:40:26.229
Oh, leave it.
Give me.


710
00:40:26.312 --> 00:40:28.189
Sit down.

711
00:40:31.484 --> 00:40:33.570
So, Sarafina,

712
00:40:33.653 --> 00:40:35.613
what brings you here?

713
00:40:38.449 --> 00:40:39.993
Trouble at home?

714
00:40:43.121 --> 00:40:48.209
The boys...
they can fight.


715
00:40:48.293 --> 00:40:49.878
What can I do?

716
00:40:51.629 --> 00:40:53.756
There are other ways,
Sarafina.


717
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.925
Like what?

718
00:40:56.009 --> 00:40:58.344
You know
what they say.


719
00:40:58.428 --> 00:41:00.930
If you want
to find a way,


720
00:41:01.014 --> 00:41:03.057
you must first know
where you're going.


721
00:41:03.141 --> 00:41:05.059
No way.

722
00:41:05.143 --> 00:41:07.228
That's not true.

723
00:41:07.312 --> 00:41:10.899
What do you want?

724
00:41:10.982 --> 00:41:14.194
What do you want,
mistress?


725
00:41:14.277 --> 00:41:15.862
Me?

726
00:41:15.945 --> 00:41:19.574
I want
very many things.


727
00:41:19.657 --> 00:41:22.869
I want the war
to be over.


728
00:41:22.952 --> 00:41:27.040
I want the hate
to be over.


729
00:41:27.123 --> 00:41:30.418
I want my Joe
back in my arms.


730
00:41:30.501 --> 00:41:36.257
I want quiet days
and loving nights.


731
00:41:36.341 --> 00:41:39.552
I want babies.

732
00:41:40.845 --> 00:41:43.848
I want to come home
to kindness.


733
00:42:10.375 --> 00:42:12.794
Would you believe me
if I told you


734
00:42:12.877 --> 00:42:14.879
this was not mine?

735
00:42:14.963 --> 00:42:16.965
Yes.

736
00:42:17.048 --> 00:42:20.468
I've never even held it
in my hands.


737
00:42:20.551 --> 00:42:23.263
It's Joe's.

738
00:42:23.346 --> 00:42:25.932
He uses it?

739
00:42:26.015 --> 00:42:29.269
He has done.

740
00:42:29.352 --> 00:42:32.939
I won't tell anyone.

741
00:42:33.022 --> 00:42:36.651
I meant what I said.

742
00:42:36.734 --> 00:42:38.319
I hate the killing.

743
00:42:38.403 --> 00:42:41.489
I hate the violence.

744
00:42:41.572 --> 00:42:43.449
But I cannot stand aside

745
00:42:43.533 --> 00:42:47.078
and let others die for me.

746
00:42:47.161 --> 00:42:50.623
I will fight too.

747
00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:53.543
I can't kill.

748
00:42:53.626 --> 00:42:56.254
Don't ask me to kill.

749
00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.466
It's the same
old argument.


750
00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.844
What if they
come for you...


751
00:43:02.927 --> 00:43:05.013
Come to the door...

752
00:43:05.096 --> 00:43:07.056
kick it in?

753
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.392
Do you reach
for the gun?


754
00:43:09.475 --> 00:43:12.061
Do you shoot?

755
00:43:13.438 --> 00:43:16.357
Do I?

756
00:43:16.441 --> 00:43:18.693
I don't know.

757
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.240
I don't know.

758
00:43:24.324 --> 00:43:26.909
( thunder rumbles
in the distance )


759
00:43:28.328 --> 00:43:30.496
( thunder )

760
00:43:41.132 --> 00:43:43.259
( thunder )

761
00:43:48.139 --> 00:43:50.558
( crashing )

762
00:43:52.268 --> 00:43:53.394
( children screaming )

763
00:43:53.478 --> 00:43:54.812
( yelling )

764
00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:10.119
( yelling continues )

765
00:44:20.213 --> 00:44:21.839
Get in. Get in!

766
00:44:21.923 --> 00:44:23.424
Get in there!
Oh, shut up,


767
00:44:23.508 --> 00:44:25.635
the rest of you!

768
00:44:25.718 --> 00:44:27.678
( helicopter hovering )

769
00:44:27.762 --> 00:44:29.889
( children crying )

770
00:44:34.185 --> 00:44:37.438
PRINCIPAL:
It's no more than rumors,
but in the present climate,


771
00:44:37.522 --> 00:44:39.607
we must listen
to everything.


772
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.444
I've given Lieutenant Bloem
my firm opinion which is:


773
00:44:43.528 --> 00:44:45.405
you are
a responsible teacher


774
00:44:45.488 --> 00:44:47.615
who would do nothing
to harm the children.


775
00:44:47.698 --> 00:44:48.825
Am I right?

776
00:44:48.908 --> 00:44:51.160
Oh, yes, principal.

777
00:44:51.244 --> 00:44:53.913
Mary, do you teach
the children Communism?


778
00:44:53.996 --> 00:44:55.164
No, principal.

779
00:44:55.248 --> 00:44:57.291
Do you teach them
violent revolution?


780
00:44:57.375 --> 00:44:59.252
No, principal.

781
00:44:59.335 --> 00:45:01.963
Do you teach the authorized
syllabus, Miss Masembuko?


782
00:45:02.046 --> 00:45:03.464
Yes.

783
00:45:03.548 --> 00:45:05.466
With additional material
of your own?


784
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.051
Yes.

785
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.051
PRINCIPAL: Mary...

786
00:45:07.135 --> 00:45:09.011
you have to follow
the authorized syllabus.


787
00:45:09.095 --> 00:45:10.471
You know that.

788
00:45:10.555 --> 00:45:12.974
And what is this, um,
additional material?


789
00:45:13.057 --> 00:45:15.643
I want them to know
where they come from.


790
00:45:15.726 --> 00:45:18.396
I want them to have
a sense of pride in themselves.


791
00:45:18.479 --> 00:45:19.939
Black pride.

792
00:45:20.022 --> 00:45:22.316
If you will.

793
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.694
You're playing with fire.

794
00:45:24.777 --> 00:45:27.155
Would you rather
they were ashamed of themselves?


795
00:45:27.238 --> 00:45:29.323
I'll tell you
what I'd rather.


796
00:45:29.407 --> 00:45:31.492
I'd rather they be left in peace
to go to school,


797
00:45:31.576 --> 00:45:33.786
get an education,
get a chance in life,


798
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.663
not get their heads stuffed
with crazy dreams.


799
00:45:35.746 --> 00:45:38.458
Like maybe one day there
won't be police at the school?


800
00:45:38.541 --> 00:45:41.294
Like maybe one day we won't be
afraid of each other?


801
00:45:41.377 --> 00:45:44.338
PRINCIPAL:
Mary, you're a fine teacher.


802
00:45:44.422 --> 00:45:46.507
I don't want to lose you.

803
00:45:46.591 --> 00:45:49.802
Follow the authorized syllabus
from now on, please,


804
00:45:49.886 --> 00:45:51.220
and nothing else.

805
00:45:51.304 --> 00:45:53.514
Right, principal.

806
00:45:53.598 --> 00:45:57.852
PRINCIPAL:
I don't think we have anything
else to say, do we, lieutenant?


807
00:45:57.935 --> 00:46:01.355
Just a small piece
of advice.


808
00:46:01.439 --> 00:46:04.150
Don't think that we're
all idiots. Okay?


809
00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:05.776
That would be a mistake.

810
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:25.046
Somebody in this room
has got the wrong idea,


811
00:46:25.129 --> 00:46:29.050
and that person
talks too much.


812
00:46:29.133 --> 00:46:33.888
So listen, huh?

813
00:46:33.971 --> 00:46:38.518
I do not teach Communism.

814
00:46:38.601 --> 00:46:41.896
I teach history.

815
00:46:41.979 --> 00:46:45.566
And history
is a beautiful thing.


816
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.235
Do you know why?

817
00:46:47.318 --> 00:46:50.071
STUDENTS:
No.


818
00:46:50.154 --> 00:46:55.618
Because history teaches you
where you come from.


819
00:46:55.701 --> 00:46:58.621
I want you to know this.

820
00:46:58.704 --> 00:47:01.541
I want you to be proud
of what we got right


821
00:47:01.624 --> 00:47:04.252
and tell the truth
about what we got wrong


822
00:47:04.335 --> 00:47:07.088
and learn from it.

823
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:11.300
Otherwise,
what's the use of tomorrow?


824
00:47:11.384 --> 00:47:14.262
If you don't learn,

825
00:47:14.345 --> 00:47:19.141
all you've got is today
and today and today.


826
00:47:19.225 --> 00:47:22.144
And you're much better
than that, people.


827
00:47:22.228 --> 00:47:25.106
Believe me.

828
00:47:25.189 --> 00:47:28.442
Believe me.

829
00:47:28.526 --> 00:47:30.111
Okay?

830
00:47:30.194 --> 00:47:32.572
STUDENTS:
Yes.

832
00:47:40.246 --> 00:47:42.373
( indistinct chatter )

833
00:47:55.845 --> 00:47:57.471
Ha, ha, ha!

834
00:47:57.555 --> 00:48:00.933
Jabu, come back here!
Jabu!


835
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:07.273
Jabu!

SARAFINA:
<i>We knew there was an informer,</i>


837
00:48:13.404 --> 00:48:15.156
<i>but not Guitar.</i>

838
00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:19.201
<i>Guitar, of all people,</i>
<i>the quietest boy in the class.</i>


839
00:48:19.285 --> 00:48:21.996
<i>Guitar, why?</i>

840
00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:25.458
<i>I felt sick inside.</i>

841
00:48:28.127 --> 00:48:32.048
Sarafina, beautiful mama,
pretty thing, baby. Mmuh!


842
00:48:32.131 --> 00:48:34.008
Put Jabu down!

843
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:36.677
Hey. Hey, take it easy.

844
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:39.847
Why don't you take out
your shambuck and beat me?


845
00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:41.849
Did I ever hurt you?

846
00:48:41.932 --> 00:48:43.684
Leave me alone!

847
00:48:43.768 --> 00:48:46.228
Oh, baby, when did I ever give
you anything but sweet words?


848
00:48:46.312 --> 00:48:48.648
Jabu, go back
to the others.


849
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:52.109
You know what? If I was a man,
I would kill you.


850
00:48:52.193 --> 00:48:53.736
Me? Why kill me?

851
00:48:53.819 --> 00:48:55.696
Everybody loves Sabela,

852
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.490
except the trash
in the streets.


853
00:48:57.573 --> 00:49:00.326
You see I sweep away
the streets for you, sweetheart.


854
00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:02.203
I make the streets
clean for you


855
00:49:02.286 --> 00:49:04.038
so you can walk so pretty.

856
00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:06.916
Our day will come.

857
00:49:06.999 --> 00:49:09.877
Sure it will,
but you'll be needing policemen.


858
00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.712
You see, everybody
needs policemen.


859
00:49:11.796 --> 00:49:13.631
Not that like you.

860
00:49:13.714 --> 00:49:17.093
Oh, so I'm the bad man,
am I?


861
00:49:17.176 --> 00:49:18.719
( mutters
in native language )


862
00:49:18.803 --> 00:49:22.223
Princess, here.
You be the policeman.


863
00:49:22.306 --> 00:49:25.059
You beat me. Okay?

864
00:49:25.142 --> 00:49:27.103
Come on. Go ahead.

865
00:49:27.186 --> 00:49:30.523
Those kids burnin' the schools.
You let them go free.


866
00:49:30.606 --> 00:49:32.900
Those kids driving the stores
out of business.


867
00:49:32.983 --> 00:49:34.777
You let them go free too.

868
00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.697
Those mobs running around the
streets looting and killing.


869
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.865
Let them go free.

870
00:49:39.949 --> 00:49:43.411
Be the policeman.
I'm the bad man.


871
00:49:43.494 --> 00:49:46.789
Okay? Beat me. Come on.

872
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.085
( snickers )
You need me, princess.


873
00:49:51.168 --> 00:49:53.295
You need me.

874
00:50:03.347 --> 00:50:05.307
( indistinct chatter )

875
00:50:08.686 --> 00:50:10.646
( guitar notes play )

876
00:50:19.029 --> 00:50:20.990
( indistinct chatter )

877
00:50:22.366 --> 00:50:23.617
What's wrong?

878
00:50:23.701 --> 00:50:25.119
You've been talking.

879
00:50:23.701 --> 00:50:25.119
Talking?

880
00:50:25.202 --> 00:50:26.829
You've been talking
to the wrong people.


881
00:50:26.912 --> 00:50:28.831
What wrong people?

882
00:50:26.912 --> 00:50:28.831
Police wrong people!

883
00:50:28.914 --> 00:50:30.458
Who says that?
It's a lie!


884
00:50:30.541 --> 00:50:33.169
SARAFINA:
I saw you with Sabela.
Don't lie to us.


885
00:50:33.252 --> 00:50:34.462
Tell us why.

886
00:50:34.545 --> 00:50:37.465
You can talk!
You're not dumb!


887
00:50:37.548 --> 00:50:39.592
SARAFINA:
Put him down, Crocodile!


888
00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.930
You live here
with your father, don't you?


889
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.476
He's sick, isn't he?

890
00:50:48.559 --> 00:50:50.811
His legs are no good.

891
00:50:50.895 --> 00:50:53.481
He's a cripple.

892
00:50:53.564 --> 00:50:55.816
Is he home?

893
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.819
Just tell us why, Guitar.

894
00:50:58.903 --> 00:51:01.781
What you goin' to do to me?

895
00:51:01.864 --> 00:51:04.867
You have to tell us
why first.


896
00:51:07.912 --> 00:51:11.457
One day I came home
from school,


897
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:17.338
and I found my dad lying
in the rubbish outside.


898
00:51:17.421 --> 00:51:21.175
He was trying to crawl,
but he couldn't move.


899
00:51:21.258 --> 00:51:25.888
His fingers were bleeding

900
00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:30.351
from trying to drag himself
through the dirt.


901
00:51:30.434 --> 00:51:32.853
He had been laying there
for hours,


902
00:51:32.937 --> 00:51:35.731
but he didn't cry out for help

903
00:51:35.815 --> 00:51:39.693
because his pride
would not let him.


904
00:51:39.777 --> 00:51:42.571
He laid there
waiting for me.


905
00:51:42.655 --> 00:51:46.200
Then<i>he</i> came--

906
00:51:46.283 --> 00:51:47.660
Sabela--

907
00:51:47.743 --> 00:51:49.662
Constable Sabela.

908
00:51:49.745 --> 00:51:52.540
He told me that my dad
was no good,


909
00:51:52.623 --> 00:51:55.835
that he couldn't work,
and that in the old days,


910
00:51:55.918 --> 00:52:02.007
men like him were taken out
into the bush and left to die.


911
00:52:02.091 --> 00:52:05.845
He said, next time,
maybe he will do that--


912
00:52:05.928 --> 00:52:10.808
take him out into the bush
and leave him there to die.


913
00:52:10.891 --> 00:52:16.522
He said he will do this
unless I helped him.


914
00:52:16.605 --> 00:52:19.692
I thought of him--

915
00:52:19.775 --> 00:52:24.446
my dad--out in the bush...

916
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:29.743
calling, not moving.

917
00:52:29.827 --> 00:52:32.329
Just calling.

918
00:52:34.415 --> 00:52:36.458
What was I supposed to do?

919
00:52:39.712 --> 00:52:42.298
I'm sorry.

920
00:52:42.381 --> 00:52:44.758
I'm sorry.

921
00:52:46.427 --> 00:52:48.178
It's okay, Guitar.

922
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.098
It's okay.

923
00:52:57.771 --> 00:52:59.398
Can I go in?

924
00:53:01.525 --> 00:53:03.444
( strums chords )

(<i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

926
00:53:19.335 --> 00:53:22.296
The Napoleonic War--

927
00:53:22.379 --> 00:53:24.757
that is what
the syllabus says,


928
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.301
so that is what I teach.

929
00:53:27.384 --> 00:53:30.137
So, what do we learn
from this?


930
00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.682
Napoleon's army--
the best equipped,


931
00:53:33.766 --> 00:53:35.935
the best-trained army,

932
00:53:36.018 --> 00:53:39.813
the most powerful army
on the continent....


933
00:53:39.897 --> 00:53:43.692
everybody says
they cannot be beaten.


934
00:53:43.776 --> 00:53:45.361
So, what happens?

935
00:53:45.444 --> 00:53:47.321
Fft! They gone.

936
00:53:47.404 --> 00:53:51.367
Why?
Were they beaten in battle?


937
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.955
No. They were defeated
by the people.


938

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.959
Oh, my God.

941
00:54:00.042 --> 00:54:02.544
People can defeat
the armies.


942
00:54:02.628 --> 00:54:04.546
History has proved it.

943
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:08.175
People can
defeat the armies.


944
00:54:12.763 --> 00:54:15.432
You. Come.

945
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:28.028
There's something at my house
which I don't need anymore.


946
00:54:28.112 --> 00:54:30.322
Get rid of it
for me.


947
00:54:34.034 --> 00:54:35.536

948
00:54:35.619 --> 00:54:38.539
( yelling stops )

949
00:54:38.622 --> 00:54:44.294
Listen. One day this is
going to be all right.


950
00:54:44.378 --> 00:54:46.839
You know me.

951
00:54:46.922 --> 00:54:48.257
I love a happy ending.

952
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.300

956
00:56:19.389 --> 00:56:20.849
Good morning.

957
00:56:20.933 --> 00:56:23.268
STUDENTS:
Good morning, sir.


958
00:56:23.352 --> 00:56:25.104
I am replacing
your regular teacher


959
00:56:25.187 --> 00:56:26.814
for the rest of the term.

960
00:56:26.897 --> 00:56:28.482
Sir.

961
00:56:26.897 --> 00:56:28.482
Yes?

962
00:56:28.565 --> 00:56:30.400
Why have they taken
Miss Masembuko?


963
00:56:30.484 --> 00:56:33.987
That's none of my business
and none of your business.


964
00:56:34.071 --> 00:56:36.532
We won't touch the subject
again. Is that clear?


965
00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:42.996
We are here to do history.

966
00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.999
How far have you got?
Somebody show me.


967
00:56:50.212 --> 00:56:52.506
Hmm.

968
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:56.635
The Napoleonic Wars.
Right?


969
00:56:56.718 --> 00:56:59.680
Why did the Russian campaign
of 1812 fail?


970
00:56:59.763 --> 00:57:01.640
What defeated them?

971
00:57:01.723 --> 00:57:02.975
The people, sir.

972
00:57:03.058 --> 00:57:05.644
I said "what," not "who."

973
00:57:07.479 --> 00:57:10.399
( sighs ):
The winter.


974
00:57:10.482 --> 00:57:13.360
Napoleon hadn't reckoned
with the Russian winter.


975
00:57:13.443 --> 00:57:15.320
He thought his army
was safe in Moscow,


976
00:57:15.404 --> 00:57:17.030
but the people in Moscow

977
00:57:17.114 --> 00:57:19.199
had burnt down their city
before he could get there.


978
00:57:19.283 --> 00:57:21.493

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:57.118
GUARD:
Shut up!


1139
01:11:57.201 --> 01:11:59.162
( cell door closes )

1140
01:12:30.193 --> 01:12:31.360

1141
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:48.795

1142
01:12:48.878 --> 01:12:50.797
MAN:
Do you go to school?


1143
01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.632
Yes.

1144
01:12:52.715 --> 01:12:55.510
So why aren't you
in school?


1145
01:12:57.845 --> 01:12:59.639
Why aren't you
in school?


1146
01:12:59.722 --> 01:13:02.517
Because of the soldiers.

1147
01:13:04.393 --> 01:13:07.480
Soldiers don't stop you
from studying.


1148
01:13:10.233 --> 01:13:12.443
Answer my questions, ma'am.

1149
01:13:12.527 --> 01:13:15.071
You didn't ask
a question.


1150
01:13:18.074 --> 01:13:20.952
How do the soldiers
stop you from studying?


1151
01:13:22.703 --> 01:13:24.330
By killing us.

1152
01:13:26.374 --> 01:13:28.543
You're not dead.

1153
01:13:28.626 --> 01:13:30.503
Are you dead?

1154
01:13:30.586 --> 01:13:32.171
No.

1155
01:13:32.255 --> 01:13:34.841
So why aren't you
in school?


1156
01:13:34.924 --> 01:13:36.801
My friends are dead.

1157
01:13:36.884 --> 01:13:38.427
Your friends?

1158
01:13:41.639 --> 01:13:45.268
The students who attacked
the soldiers are your friends?


1159
01:13:47.103 --> 01:13:49.522
Students who murdered
a constable last night,


1160
01:13:49.605 --> 01:13:51.065
they're your friends?

1161
01:13:52.775 --> 01:13:55.361
Is that how
your friends behave...


1162
01:13:55.444 --> 01:13:56.779
like wild animals?

1163
01:13:58.447 --> 01:14:00.867
Where were you
last night?


1164
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:03.369
At home.

1165
01:14:03.452 --> 01:14:08.875
Do you know how
Constable Sabela was murdered?


1166
01:14:08.958 --> 01:14:12.044
A mob of children
burned him to death.


1167
01:14:12.128 --> 01:14:13.880
Did you know that?

1168
01:14:13.963 --> 01:14:16.048
I heard.

1169
01:14:16.132 --> 01:14:18.342
So, what do you
think about it?


1170
01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:21.679
Nothing.

1171
01:14:21.762 --> 01:14:23.848
Nothing.

1172
01:14:25.808 --> 01:14:27.560
Do you think...

1173
01:14:27.643 --> 01:14:31.647
burning a man to death
is nothing?


1174
01:14:31.731 --> 01:14:33.024
Hey!

1175
01:14:36.444 --> 01:14:38.487
What's going on
in the schools, huh?


1176
01:14:41.157 --> 01:14:43.868
Somebody's looking
for trouble, aren't they?


1177
01:14:46.287 --> 01:14:48.748
Are you looking for trouble?

1178
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.792
You don't have
to look for trouble.


1179
01:14:51.876 --> 01:14:53.085
What's that?

1180
01:14:53.169 --> 01:14:57.590
We don't have
to look for trouble.


1181
01:14:57.673 --> 01:15:00.927
Trouble finds you, huh?

1182
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:04.013
Our life is trouble.

1183
01:15:04.096 --> 01:15:06.182
So whose fault is that?

1184
01:15:07.892 --> 01:15:09.268
Who's making the trouble?

1185
01:15:11.354 --> 01:15:14.649
We're not completely
stupid, you know.


1186
01:15:14.732 --> 01:15:18.069
School kids don't just
come up with this stuff


1187
01:15:18.152 --> 01:15:20.947
out of their own heads.

1188
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:23.282
We know
you're being used.


1189
01:15:25.284 --> 01:15:28.371
Do you know
Mary Masembuko?


1190
01:15:28.454 --> 01:15:30.289
She's my teacher.

1191
01:15:30.373 --> 01:15:31.999
Was.

1192
01:15:35.586 --> 01:15:37.588
What do you mean?

1193
01:15:39.048 --> 01:15:40.633
She killed herself.

1194
01:15:44.387 --> 01:15:46.389
Did you ever go
to her house?


1195
01:15:48.266 --> 01:15:51.894
Did you ever meet
Joe Masembuko?


1196
01:15:54.021 --> 01:15:57.400
How did she die?

1197
01:15:57.483 --> 01:16:00.152
She jumped out
the window.


1198
01:16:00.236 --> 01:16:02.363
Tenth floor.

1199
01:16:03.572 --> 01:16:06.033
You didn't have to kill her.

1200
01:16:06.117 --> 01:16:08.995
I told you, she killed herself.

1201
01:16:09.078 --> 01:16:10.454
She wanted to die.

1202
01:16:10.538 --> 01:16:13.541
No.

1203
01:16:13.624 --> 01:16:15.668
I knew her.

1204
01:16:15.751 --> 01:16:17.878
She wanted...

1205
01:16:19.588 --> 01:16:21.716
She wanted so much.

1206
01:16:23.592 --> 01:16:27.430
So you knew her
pretty well, huh?


1207
01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:33.102
I loved her.

1208
01:16:35.271 --> 01:16:40.359
Yeah. So you can
help me, can't you?


1209
01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.199
Did you meet anyone else
at her house?


1210
01:16:52.788 --> 01:16:54.373
All right.

1211
01:16:57.126 --> 01:16:58.878
Now you listen to me, girlie,

1212
01:16:58.961 --> 01:17:01.630
and you listen hard.

1213
01:17:01.714 --> 01:17:04.675
I don't give a shit
how young you are.


1214
01:17:04.759 --> 01:17:06.385
You throw a bomb at me,

1215
01:17:06.469 --> 01:17:08.346
I'm gonna kill you.

1216
01:17:08.429 --> 01:17:11.015
You try to burn down my house,

1217
01:17:11.098 --> 01:17:13.309
I'm gonna kill you.

1218
01:17:13.392 --> 01:17:17.396
You make war on<i>my</i> country,

1219
01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.981
I'm gonna kill you.

1220
01:17:22.193 --> 01:17:24.070
You think you got
the whole of black Africa


1221
01:17:24.153 --> 01:17:26.739
just waiting
to roll on over us, eh?


1222
01:17:26.822 --> 01:17:28.908
You try it.

1223
01:17:28.991 --> 01:17:30.201
Just try it.

1224
01:17:30.284 --> 01:17:32.453
We're ready for you.

1225
01:17:35.247 --> 01:17:36.874
So...

1226
01:17:36.957 --> 01:17:39.502
let's just stop
horsing around, eh?


1227
01:17:44.673 --> 01:17:46.759
Tenth floor.

1228
01:17:46.842 --> 01:17:48.010
( door slams shut )

1229
01:17:49.387 --> 01:17:51.555
SARAFINA:
<i>I killed a man, Nelson.</i>


1230
01:17:51.639 --> 01:17:53.599
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

1231
01:17:53.682 --> 01:17:55.476
<i>Did</i> I<i>kill him?</i>

1232
01:17:55.559 --> 01:17:59.105
<i>I was there.</i>
<i>I wanted to kill him.</i>


1233
01:17:59.188 --> 01:18:00.981
<i>I saw his eyes.</i>

1234
01:18:01.065 --> 01:18:04.485
<i>I hated him so much,</i>
<i>I wanted to kill him.</i>


1235
01:18:04.568 --> 01:18:06.987
<i>But then I saw his eyes.</i>

1236
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:10.116
<i>See what they've done</i>
<i>to me, Nelson?</i>


1237
01:18:10.199 --> 01:18:13.994
<i>They've filled me up with hate,</i>
<i>but not enough.</i>


1238
01:18:14.078 --> 01:18:16.497
<i>I have to be</i>
<i>so full of hate,</i>


1239
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.250
<i>there's no room</i>
<i>for anything else.</i>


1240
01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:21.627
Make me numb, Nelson.

1241
01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:23.796
Make me numb.

1242
01:18:26.006 --> 01:18:28.551
( woman screams )

1243
01:18:34.432 --> 01:18:36.892
You're not there, are you?

1244
01:18:39.061 --> 01:18:41.230
You can't hear me.

1245
01:18:43.232 --> 01:18:45.109
You can't hear anyone.

1246
01:18:45.192 --> 01:18:48.320
You've gone away.

1247
01:18:48.404 --> 01:18:50.239
We just dreamed you.

1248
01:18:52.116 --> 01:18:55.161
You've been away
too long, Nelson.


1249
01:18:55.244 --> 01:18:57.830
You're old now,

1250
01:18:57.913 --> 01:19:00.833
and your children are dying,

1251
01:19:00.916 --> 01:19:03.836
and you can't hear us.

1252
01:19:03.919 --> 01:19:05.880
( "Safa Saphel' Isizwe"
<i>playing</i> )


1253
01:19:08.591 --> 01:19:10.885
(<i>chorus singing</i>
<i>in native language</i> )


1254
01:20:04.063 --> 01:20:08.400
They took me to a prison,
and they beat me.


1255
01:20:08.484 --> 01:20:09.818
When I cried,

1256
01:20:09.902 --> 01:20:11.737
they put their biggest gun
in my mouth


1257
01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.906
so I wouldn't cry.

1258
01:20:13.989 --> 01:20:16.450
Then they covered my head
with a wet sack


1259
01:20:16.534 --> 01:20:19.578
and gave me the electricity.

1260
01:20:19.662 --> 01:20:23.874
I cried like a little babe
holding the gun in my mouth.


1261
01:20:25.209 --> 01:20:27.419
GIRL:
<i>He took me to a room</i>


1262
01:20:27.503 --> 01:20:30.923
<i>full of dead bodies.</i>

1263
01:20:31.006 --> 01:20:34.093
<i>He said he would</i>
<i>leave me with them.</i>


1264
01:20:34.176 --> 01:20:37.721
I began to cry.

1265
01:20:37.805 --> 01:20:41.600
He took my face,
then turned it to the light...


1266
01:20:41.684 --> 01:20:43.936
and he laughed.

1267
01:20:44.019 --> 01:20:45.729
And he said,

1268
01:20:45.813 --> 01:20:48.941
"Look, your eyes are pissing."

1269
01:21:02.329 --> 01:21:03.581
GUARD:
Come on.


1270
01:21:18.887 --> 01:21:21.849
BOY:
<i>He shouted my name.</i>


1271
01:21:21.932 --> 01:21:23.809
<i>He pointed at me.</i>

1272
01:21:23.893 --> 01:21:25.811
<i>"Come to me, boy."</i>

1273
01:21:25.894 --> 01:21:30.190
I was so afraid
I couldn't speak.


1274
01:21:30.274 --> 01:21:33.819
I walked slowly towards him.

1275
01:21:33.902 --> 01:21:35.654
When I was close,

1276
01:21:35.738 --> 01:21:38.490
he hit me hard, here.

1277
01:21:38.574 --> 01:21:40.492
It hurt so much

1278
01:21:40.576 --> 01:21:44.330
I screamed
and fell to the ground.


1279
01:21:44.413 --> 01:21:47.458
He pointed at me again.

1280
01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:49.668
"Come to me, boy."

1281
01:21:49.752 --> 01:21:54.798
I was still crying.
I knew he would hit me again.


1282
01:21:54.882 --> 01:21:56.675
I put my hands here

1283
01:21:56.759 --> 01:21:59.219
so it wouldn't hurt so bad,

1284
01:21:59.303 --> 01:22:01.347
but he hit me again.

1285
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:06.352
It hurt so bad
I couldn't cry anymore.


1286
01:22:06.435 --> 01:22:11.649
There were many of us,
all from my school.


1287
01:22:11.732 --> 01:22:14.318
They took us to a big room.

1288
01:22:14.401 --> 01:22:17.696
<i>They told us</i>
<i>to take off our clothes,</i>


1289
01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.824
<i>all our clothes.</i>

1290
01:22:20.908 --> 01:22:23.869
<i>They told us</i>
<i>to lie down on the floor.</i>


1291
01:22:23.952 --> 01:22:26.705
Then many police came in.

1292
01:22:26.789 --> 01:22:31.710
They whipped us with shambucks
until we bled.


1293
01:22:31.794 --> 01:22:36.548
When they were tired,
more police came in.


1294
01:22:36.632 --> 01:22:40.469
They whipped us again,
and we bled more.


1295
01:22:53.273 --> 01:22:56.568
This time is called
the state of emergency,


1296
01:22:56.652 --> 01:22:58.779
1986.

1297
01:22:58.862 --> 01:23:02.574
