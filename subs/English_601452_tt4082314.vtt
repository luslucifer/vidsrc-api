1
00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:58.690
- Simon,
your tea is ready!


2
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.872
And remember to wash your hands.

3
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:38.972
Simon?

4
00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:41.112
Simon?!

5
00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:42.665
Simon?!

6
00:02:07.828 --> 00:02:09.416
- Simon!

7
00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:40.205
- Father!

8
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:45.590
- Gentlemen, please excuse us.

9
00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:47.005
- No problem, Father.

10
00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:49.801
- Good afternoon, Simon.

11
00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.596
- Father, you have to go.

12
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.184
Someone's coming to hurt you.

13
00:02:54.564 --> 00:02:56.083
- Come.

14
00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:01.468
Did you see something
again, Simon?


15
00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:03.021
- He's going to hurt you.

16
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.300
- Simon,

17
00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:09.821
these visions of yours,
they don't always come true.


18
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.236
- You have to go now,
he's coming for you.


19
00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:12.686
- Who's coming?

20
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:14.101
- Father!

21
00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:16.138
You let this happen!

22
00:03:17.173 --> 00:03:18.347
You knew!

23
00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:20.694
I told you I'd kill him!

24
00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:21.929
- Simon, go!

25
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.309
Into the vestry and
lock the door!


26
00:03:23.317 --> 00:03:24.698
Quickly now!

27
00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:27.667
My son, you're in
God's house now.


28
00:03:31.947 --> 00:03:33.742
- Your punishment

29
00:03:33.776 --> 00:03:36.123
for your killing him!

30
00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:11.814
Come on!

31
00:04:12.573 --> 00:04:14.368
Open the door!

32
00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:15.507
Open the fucking door!

33
00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:17.371
- Simon!

34
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:47.539
- Hey,
what the hell's happened here?!


35
00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:49.403
Hey!

36
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.616
- Simon, are we
going to the park or not?


37
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.169
- On my way.

38
00:08:04.874 --> 00:08:06.413
- I never get tired
of this view.


39
00:08:08.602 --> 00:08:10.294
So how are the studies going?

40
00:08:10.328 --> 00:08:12.468
- Yeah, good.

41
00:08:12.503 --> 00:08:13.814
Finishing the online course,

42
00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:16.817
so I should be done
in a few weeks.


43
00:08:16.852 --> 00:08:18.647
- So you're going to be
a computer programmer.


44
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.028
- Not likely.

45
00:08:20.062 --> 00:08:21.132
But it's helped.

46
00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:21.912
It's started to.

47
00:08:21.926 --> 00:08:23.514
- Simon,

48
00:08:23.548 --> 00:08:24.653
is that you?

49
00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:26.620
- Alison, hi.

50
00:08:28.036 --> 00:08:29.209
- Mrs. Eildon.

51
00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.418
Simon, it's nice
to see you again.


52
00:08:31.453 --> 00:08:33.248
It's been ages.

53
00:08:33.282 --> 00:08:35.008
Not seen you since school.

54
00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:37.217
Where have you been hiding?

55
00:08:37.252 --> 00:08:38.952
- I've just been doing
a bit of studying.


56
00:08:40.634 --> 00:08:42.015
Look after Mum a bit.

57
00:08:45.053 --> 00:08:46.882
I've been doing a programming
course on databases.


58
00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:48.401
- Sweet.

59
00:08:48.435 --> 00:08:49.530
- Yeah, it's good.

60
00:08:57.306 --> 00:08:58.445
- Well, it's nice
to see you again.


61
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.033
Maybe see you around?

62
00:09:01.552 --> 00:09:03.071
Bye, Mrs. Eildon.

63
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.871
- Mom, don't say it.

64
00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:14.047
- She seemed nice.

65
00:09:18.086 --> 00:09:19.825
- Look, you know I can't
get involved with anyone.


66
00:09:20.536 --> 00:09:22.021
- Son,

67
00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:24.264
you can't be an island.

68
00:09:26.853 --> 00:09:28.653
You've hidden yourself from
the world for too long.


69
00:09:31.892 --> 00:09:33.197
When I'm gone, you'll be free.

70
00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:45.147
- Better get you back
before you get cold.


71
00:10:07.204 --> 00:10:08.308
- Came out again.

72
00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:15.384
- Dr. Thompson said your
platelet count was up slightly.


73
00:10:15.419 --> 00:10:16.834
So that's good.

74
00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:19.457
- Dr. Thompson wouldn't
know a platelet


75
00:10:19.492 --> 00:10:21.149
from a dinner service.

76
00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:25.567
What's wrong?

77
00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:27.155
You're bleeding.

78
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.571
- What?

79
00:10:29.605 --> 00:10:30.641
No, I'm fine.

80
00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:32.229
It's nothing.

81
00:11:38.087 --> 00:11:40.159
- God,
Simon, what happened?


82
00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:47.165
- I don't know.

83
00:11:49.547 --> 00:11:52.309
It was like a vision
but it was real.


84
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.174
Like it was happening now.

85
00:11:57.555 --> 00:11:59.108
He's back

86
00:12:00.489 --> 00:12:02.042
and he's just killed again.

87
00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:10.119
- So,

88
00:12:10.154 --> 00:12:12.432
if I understand
this, Mr. Eildon,


89
00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:13.744
you're reporting a murder.

90
00:12:13.778 --> 00:12:15.780
- That's right.

91
00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:18.024
- But you don't know
the name of the victim,


92
00:12:18.058 --> 00:12:19.922
where they were murdered
or who the murderer is.


93
00:12:19.957 --> 00:12:21.648
- No.

94
00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:22.891
But I do know how and when.

95
00:12:22.925 --> 00:12:24.375
- Yes.

96
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.067
It was around 10AM this morning

97
00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:28.483
and the perpetrator
used his fists,


98
00:12:28.517 --> 00:12:30.312
a blunt force weapon

99
00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:31.642
and something that buttoned.

100
00:12:33.764 --> 00:12:35.455
And how do you know this?

101
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.785
Came to you in a dream, did it?

102
00:12:42.013 --> 00:12:43.513
Must be hard being
a full-time carer.


103
00:12:45.707 --> 00:12:47.156
Stressful.

104
00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:50.401
Well, thanks for
letting us know.


105
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.954
We'll make some inquires.

106
00:13:14.563 --> 00:13:16.600
- He didn't believe you.

107
00:13:16.634 --> 00:13:17.929
- I sounded like a right nutter.

108
00:13:20.776 --> 00:13:22.744
- What now?

109
00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:24.178
- I'll have to do
something myself.


110
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:27.266
- Can anyone help?

111
00:13:29.337 --> 00:13:30.890
- Maybe.

112
00:13:31.546 --> 00:13:32.961
If there's someone.

113
00:16:01.212 --> 00:16:02.766
Wakey, wakey.

114
00:16:05.941 --> 00:16:07.978
- You were up late again.

115
00:16:08.012 --> 00:16:10.670
- You have coffee, fruit juice

116
00:16:10.705 --> 00:16:12.638
and your favorite
medically approved--


117
00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:15.434
- Simon!

118
00:16:15.468 --> 00:16:16.987
Simon?!

119
00:16:17.366 --> 00:16:18.851
Simon!

120
00:16:19.438 --> 00:16:21.060
Simon!

121
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:26.203
Simon!

122
00:16:29.517 --> 00:16:31.001
Oh no!

123
00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:14.251
- Mom!

124
00:17:15.148 --> 00:17:16.667
Mom!

125
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.531
No, please, please, Mom!

126
00:17:20.015 --> 00:17:20.809
Mom, please.

127
00:17:54.602 --> 00:17:55.913
- Thy will is done.

128
00:17:58.571 --> 00:18:00.055
Let us pray.

129
00:19:57.759 --> 00:19:59.899
- The ambassador sends
his personal thanks


130
00:19:59.934 --> 00:20:02.695
for the removal of our agent
with such minimal damage.


131
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.869
- Which we wouldn't
have had to do


132
00:20:03.903 --> 00:20:06.595
if the ambassador had done
his job in the first place.


133
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.218
- And that new camera in
your bag's been sorted.


134
00:20:11.704 --> 00:20:13.223
- Chatham.

135
00:20:13.257 --> 00:20:14.673
- Miss
Chatham, how are you?


136
00:20:14.707 --> 00:20:16.398
- Who is this?

137
00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:17.814
- I'm sorry for
approaching you like this


138
00:20:17.848 --> 00:20:20.161
but I need your help.

139
00:20:20.195 --> 00:20:21.576
- Trace this call.

140
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.854
You realize this is a
private government line.


141
00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:26.236
Illegal access is an
offense with a penalty.


142
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.686
- In one hour's time,
there'll be an attempted coup


143
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.920
on a small island in the
Indian Ocean that will fail.


144
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:33.208
- How do you know this?

145
00:20:33.243 --> 00:20:34.831
- At lunch time,

146
00:20:34.865 --> 00:20:36.936
the Parliamentary Under-Secretary
of State for Defense


147
00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:39.490
will be caught on camera
indiscreetly criticizing


148
00:20:39.525 --> 00:20:41.907
the Prime Minister and will
have lost his job by tea time.


149
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:43.632
- Who are you and
what do you want?


150
00:20:43.667 --> 00:20:45.704
- What I want
is for to arrange


151
00:20:45.738 --> 00:20:48.258
full transaction immunity
for a Mr. Steve Brennus.


152
00:20:48.292 --> 00:20:49.500
- Why?

153
00:20:49.535 --> 00:20:50.950
Who's he?

154
00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:52.280
- You'll find his file.

155
00:20:53.884 --> 00:20:57.094
- Full immunity from all
crimes just because you phoned?


156
00:20:57.129 --> 00:20:58.682
- Because of the
information I'm giving you.


157
00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.408
But right now, a fellow agent

158
00:21:00.442 --> 00:21:02.444
with a titanium gentle
piercing is about to say,


159
00:21:02.479 --> 00:21:03.894
"You won't like it."

160
00:21:05.137 --> 00:21:06.828
- We traced a call and
you won't like it.


161
00:21:13.801 --> 00:21:15.768
- Who the hell is Steve Brennus?

162
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.092
- Christine?

163
00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:05.927
- Mr. Steve Brennus,
hope this isn't a bad time.


164
00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:09.027
- Define "bad."

165
00:22:12.652 --> 00:22:14.171
- Steve, I'm sorry.

166
00:22:14.206 --> 00:22:16.691
- How the hell could
he lose all our money?


167
00:22:16.725 --> 00:22:18.831
- I don't know, he just did.

168
00:22:18.866 --> 00:22:21.144
- Chris, Chris, we'll go
bankrupt, we'll lose the house!


169
00:22:21.178 --> 00:22:22.678
- Do you think that
I don't know that?


170
00:22:25.217 --> 00:22:26.666
- What, so it's my fault?

171
00:22:26.701 --> 00:22:28.358
- Well, he's your
brother, isn't he?


172
00:22:28.392 --> 00:22:29.980
- You didn't need
to lend him it.


173
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.464
- Jesus Christ!

174
00:22:31.499 --> 00:22:33.363
Oh, Sally.
- Sally!


175
00:22:33.397 --> 00:22:34.692
Sweetheart, Mommy's here.

176
00:22:35.606 --> 00:22:37.505
Steve!

177
00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:39.334
Steve, call the ambulance!

178
00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:40.369
Call them now!

179
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.750
- Okay!

180
00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:43.476
- What
are you doing?!


181
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:45.375
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

182
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:46.894
Steve!

183
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:48.412
- Hello, yeah,

184
00:22:48.447 --> 00:22:50.656
can I get an ambulance please?

185
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:52.658
Yeah, my daughter's
hurt her head.


186
00:23:00.562 --> 00:23:02.702
- Sally
wasn't badly hurt.


187
00:23:02.706 --> 00:23:03.496
She and your wife
just need some time


188
00:23:03.498 --> 00:23:04.177
before they see you again.

189
00:23:04.187 --> 00:23:05.602
- What?

190
00:23:05.636 --> 00:23:06.603
Who is this?

191
00:23:07.707 --> 00:23:10.020
- 25 thousand.

192
00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.160
- Listen, asshole,

193
00:23:12.195 --> 00:23:15.267
I could hurt you in ways
you can't even dream of.


194
00:23:15.301 --> 00:23:17.372
- 25 thousand gets the
banks off your back for now


195
00:23:17.407 --> 00:23:20.030
and saves the house.

196
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.377
In exchange for this four
day's work, the money is yours.


197
00:23:22.412 --> 00:23:25.001
- Yeah, not interested.

198
00:23:25.035 --> 00:23:26.140
- The house that Christine
and Sally call home.


199
00:23:29.143 --> 00:23:31.110
My name is Simon.

200
00:23:31.145 --> 00:23:32.525
Please meet me under
the rail bridge


201
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.113
at Queen Street at noon.

202
00:23:35.943 --> 00:23:37.116
One other thing.

203
00:23:37.427 --> 00:23:38.669
- What?

204
00:23:38.704 --> 00:23:39.636
- Have a shower and a shave.

205
00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:44.563
- That's my bloody phone.

206
00:24:44.597 --> 00:24:47.186
- I told you
you wouldn't like it.


207
00:24:48.567 --> 00:24:49.671
Would you be good enough

208
00:24:49.706 --> 00:24:50.845
to come down to Operations,
please, Miss Chatham?


209
00:25:32.404 --> 00:25:33.853
- Got you.

210
00:25:47.971 --> 00:25:49.214
- Mr. Brennus.

211
00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:52.182
- So much for the
element of surprise.


212
00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:55.530
- Simon.

213
00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:58.050
- So you said.

214
00:26:02.434 --> 00:26:04.505
Okay,

215
00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:06.162
so what's all this about then?

216
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.750
- I want you to stop someone.

217
00:26:08.785 --> 00:26:10.476
- What's your problem?

218
00:26:10.511 --> 00:26:11.546
Gambling debts, sort
a dealer, what?


219
00:26:11.581 --> 00:26:13.341
- No.

220
00:26:13.376 --> 00:26:14.722
Nothing like that.

221
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.106
- In four days time,

222
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.108
I believe a serial killer
is going to murder me.


223
00:26:23.938 --> 00:26:26.078
Absurd as it sounds, it's true.

224
00:26:27.183 --> 00:26:29.012
- See you later.

225
00:26:29.047 --> 00:26:30.013
- Look, you and your
family need my help.


226
00:26:33.672 --> 00:26:34.914
- How do you know anything
about me and my family?


227
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:41.818
- During the firefight
in Afghanistan,


228
00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:45.580
you couldn't have known
it would've happened.


229
00:26:47.651 --> 00:26:48.480
Sally had just been born

230
00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.760
and you realized you had a
new responsibility in life.


231
00:26:55.142 --> 00:26:57.385
You had to go home alive
to your wife and daughter.


232
00:26:59.318 --> 00:27:01.976
For a split second,

233
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.495
you thought maybe it was time
to pack in being a soldier.


234
00:27:05.428 --> 00:27:06.877
So you paused.

235
00:27:08.914 --> 00:27:09.708
And then that
second's hesitation,


236
00:27:12.469 --> 00:27:13.815
the grenades hit.

237
00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:16.577
And that's when your mate,
Spitball, didn't make it home.


238
00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:25.068
- Nobody knows about that.

239
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.933
Nobody.

240
00:27:29.693 --> 00:27:32.765
Who the hell are you?

241
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.285
- I'm the person that's paying
you to stop a serial killer.


242
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.735
It's all there.

243
00:27:37.218 --> 00:27:38.771
Payment in advance.

244
00:27:41.153 --> 00:27:44.329
Do you believe in
psychics, Mr. Brennus?


245
00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:46.572
- Oh, Christ, is
that why I'm here?


246
00:27:46.607 --> 00:27:47.746
- Sorry, if you want a
trip to La La Land,


247
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.368
you're on your own.

248
00:27:49.403 --> 00:27:51.577
- So nothing's ever happened
that you can't explain?


249
00:27:51.612 --> 00:27:52.889
- Well of course there has

250
00:27:52.923 --> 00:27:53.890
but that doesn't mean
I see it supernatural.


251
00:27:56.203 --> 00:27:58.515
- Look, I need your help.

252
00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.208
Whether you believe me
or not, you need 25K.


253
00:28:01.242 --> 00:28:02.830
It's only four days.

254
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.494
I'm going to live
to regret this.


255
00:28:19.157 --> 00:28:21.055
- You're
listing to Spirit Radio,


256
00:28:21.089 --> 00:28:22.781
the nation's number one
medium by mediums for mediums.


257
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.199
Coming up later today we
have an exclusive interview


258
00:28:27.234 --> 00:28:29.443
with Marcus Bryant, the
controversial Leeds priest


259
00:28:29.477 --> 00:28:30.996
who speaks with the dead.

260
00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:33.999
First, though, let's
go over to the weather


261
00:28:34.033 --> 00:28:35.103
and see what the gods have
got in store for us this time.


262
00:28:43.111 --> 00:28:43.940
- So who's this guy
that's after you?


263
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:47.771
- I don't know his name

264
00:28:47.806 --> 00:28:49.497
or what he looks like
or where he lives.


265
00:28:52.638 --> 00:28:53.605
- So, what, he's
threatened you then?


266
00:28:55.262 --> 00:28:56.642
- Not exactly.

267
00:28:57.781 --> 00:28:59.335
I think he's been
away for a few years.


268
00:28:59.369 --> 00:29:00.681
Locked up, maybe.

269
00:29:00.715 --> 00:29:01.854
Prison, an asylum.

270
00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:05.203
Anyway, it doesn't really
matter because he's back.


271
00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:09.379
- You said there's
other victims.


272
00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:11.554
- Yeah.

273
00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:12.348
I don't know
anything about them.


274
00:29:12.382 --> 00:29:14.591
- Jesus Christ,

275
00:29:14.626 --> 00:29:15.903
your a vague as
hell about this guy


276
00:29:15.937 --> 00:29:16.904
but you seem to know
everything about me.


277
00:29:18.837 --> 00:29:20.701
What's this psychic bullshit?

278
00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:23.428
- I think it's better
if I show you.


279
00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:34.024
- Nice.

280
00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:35.819
Very artistic.

281
00:29:35.854 --> 00:29:37.407
You'll win the tunnel
prize with this, mate.


282
00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.618
- All right, look, you're
walking down a street,


283
00:29:41.653 --> 00:29:43.310
say the High Street in town.

284
00:29:43.344 --> 00:29:44.449
- Yeah, that wouldn't happen,

285
00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:47.072
there's no pubs on
the High Street.


286
00:29:47.106 --> 00:29:48.176
- Fine, you're on
Constitution Street then.


287
00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:49.626
- Better.

288
00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:51.628
- Close your eyes.

289
00:29:52.698 --> 00:29:54.493
Please, just do it.

290
00:29:54.528 --> 00:29:56.219
You can be outside
your favorite pub.


291
00:30:00.775 --> 00:30:02.674
Now, do you notice everything?

292
00:30:03.882 --> 00:30:06.885
A person here, a car
there, flower pots.


293
00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:08.714
Gas canisters outside
an old church.


294
00:30:08.749 --> 00:30:10.854
- No, of course not.

295
00:30:10.889 --> 00:30:12.925
- No but you notice a small
child run across the road


296
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.720
that nearly gets knocked down

297
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.860
but you don't know this
old lady behind you


298
00:30:16.895 --> 00:30:17.654
is getting her purse stolen.

299
00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:22.314
That's what it's like for me.

300
00:30:22.349 --> 00:30:25.559
I see the street but not
everything that's happening.


301
00:30:25.593 --> 00:30:27.354
I get glimpse of the
future and the past,


302
00:30:27.388 --> 00:30:28.769
and sometimes the present,

303
00:30:28.803 --> 00:30:31.081
but it's all random,
jumbled detail


304
00:30:31.116 --> 00:30:32.531
all unconnected events.

305
00:30:35.293 --> 00:30:37.847
And I have to look for clues.

306
00:30:37.881 --> 00:30:41.091
Dates and times and I have
to piece it all together.


307
00:30:41.126 --> 00:30:43.439
- And you think he's gonna
kill all these other people.


308
00:30:43.473 --> 00:30:44.440
- I know he is.

309
00:30:48.858 --> 00:30:50.515
And he's also going to kill me.

310
00:30:54.795 --> 00:30:57.073
- So, why don't you just
hide, stay in bed that day?


311
00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.284
- I've seen my own death but
I have to try and prevent him


312
00:31:01.319 --> 00:31:02.837
from hurting anyone else.

313
00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:05.046
- I'll be honest, mate.

314
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:06.876
You've got nothing here.

315
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:08.843
No specific intel, no places,

316
00:31:08.878 --> 00:31:11.018
you don't know the
killer's name.


317
00:31:11.052 --> 00:31:13.123
It's a wild goose chase,
it's a waste of time.


318
00:31:13.158 --> 00:31:14.918
- I know he's coming for me.

319
00:31:14.953 --> 00:31:16.506
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna
need a little bit more


320
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.611
than you tingling "spider
sense" to go on.


321
00:31:20.268 --> 00:31:21.787
You seem like a decent guy
but this is just crazy, mate.


322
00:31:23.651 --> 00:31:27.345
- Fine, just be my bodyguard.

323
00:31:27.379 --> 00:31:29.001
Stick around until he strikes.

324
00:31:32.488 --> 00:31:35.007
- Okay.

325
00:31:35.042 --> 00:31:36.871
But if I'm staying, you
better have some beers then.


326
00:31:39.426 --> 00:31:40.599
- All right, great.

327
00:31:40.634 --> 00:31:42.049
I'll go and get some.

328
00:31:54.717 --> 00:31:55.821
- Let the cleansing begin!

329
00:32:00.447 --> 00:32:02.138
- So, someone called
our secure line.


330
00:32:03.795 --> 00:32:04.761
And they did it with your phone,

331
00:32:06.453 --> 00:32:08.800
leaving no prints, of course.

332
00:32:08.834 --> 00:32:11.768
- Sir, I have
no idea how this happened.


333
00:32:11.803 --> 00:32:12.907
- Well, apparently,
we're about to find out.


334
00:32:15.151 --> 00:32:16.463
What have you got?

335
00:32:17.533 --> 00:32:18.430
- This was recorded
in the city center.


336
00:32:23.331 --> 00:32:24.850
- Jesus.

337
00:32:31.339 --> 00:32:32.720
- What's this nonsense?

338
00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:34.308
- The share index crashed today.

339
00:32:34.342 --> 00:32:35.620
They closed at 5-8-9-5.

340
00:32:38.381 --> 00:32:39.693
- When was this recorded?

341
00:32:39.727 --> 00:32:41.280
- Yesterday,
sir, Monday.


342
00:32:41.315 --> 00:32:42.696
- Good God.

343
00:32:44.249 --> 00:32:45.768
Fuck me.

344
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:50.738
Find out who that
little bastard is.


345
00:32:56.882 --> 00:32:58.194
- Simon!

346
00:33:00.265 --> 00:33:01.784
Simon?!

347
00:33:08.515 --> 00:33:10.309
Jesus Christ, Simon!

348
00:33:10.344 --> 00:33:11.449
Simon!

349
00:33:14.969 --> 00:33:17.247
- The blasphemer will
talk to the dead no more.


350
00:33:17.282 --> 00:33:20.837
So perish all false prophets

351
00:33:20.872 --> 00:33:24.600
who claim to commune with
the world of the spirits.


352
00:33:24.634 --> 00:33:25.463
- Emergency
Police Service.


353
00:33:29.156 --> 00:33:30.571
- I'll be fine.

354
00:33:33.609 --> 00:33:34.920
I know why he's killing them.

355
00:33:38.096 --> 00:33:38.890
He's targeting psychics.

356
00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:41.824
- Simon!

357
00:33:41.858 --> 00:33:43.273
Simon!

358
00:34:01.568 --> 00:34:03.328
- "Steve Brennus forgets
to send cuddly toy


359
00:34:03.362 --> 00:34:05.019
"to Sally for her birthday."

360
00:34:05.226 --> 00:34:06.711
Jesus.

361
00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:26.420
No, I've tried ordering online
but it won't accept my card.


362
00:34:26.454 --> 00:34:28.077
No.

363
00:34:28.111 --> 00:34:29.665
No, don't put me on hold.

364
00:34:31.252 --> 00:34:32.633
Jesus Christ.

365
00:35:05.286 --> 00:35:07.323
It's okay, it's okay.

366
00:35:07.357 --> 00:35:08.876
You're safe.

367
00:35:10.602 --> 00:35:12.017
You okay?

368
00:35:15.262 --> 00:35:16.677
All right?

369
00:35:16.919 --> 00:35:18.472
- Yeah.

370
00:35:45.223 --> 00:35:46.673
- So what the hell was all that
carrying on in the bathroom?


371
00:35:48.433 --> 00:35:50.021
- He was skinning him alive.

372
00:35:50.953 --> 00:35:52.092
That's a new one.

373
00:35:53.921 --> 00:35:55.095
- So he's targeting psychics.

374
00:35:58.132 --> 00:36:00.618
- Probably thinks he's the
only one that hears voices.


375
00:36:00.652 --> 00:36:01.480
"I am the chosen one,"
blah, blah, blah.


376
00:36:01.515 --> 00:36:03.275
You know how it goes.

377
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:04.932
- So how can we draw him out?

378
00:36:06.969 --> 00:36:08.142
- First thing's first, did
you bring what I asked?


379
00:36:12.077 --> 00:36:13.285
Traceable?

380
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.735
- Use it and lose it.

381
00:36:19.429 --> 00:36:20.879
- The coup on that island?

382
00:36:20.914 --> 00:36:24.780
- Happened like he said
and failed like he said.


383
00:36:24.814 --> 00:36:26.713
- And we all know the
Under-Secretary of State


384
00:36:26.747 --> 00:36:28.680
fell on his sword
following his indiscretion.


385
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.339
- He's got three out of three.

386
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.518
Yes?

387
00:36:39.553 --> 00:36:41.106
- Hello
again, Miss Chatham.


388
00:36:43.177 --> 00:36:45.110
- Who is this?

389
00:36:45.145 --> 00:36:46.767
- I'm sure you'll work
that out soon but for now,


390
00:36:46.802 --> 00:36:47.941
please, about that immunity.

391
00:36:50.529 --> 00:36:52.739
- Why do you need this
immunity so badly?


392
00:36:52.773 --> 00:36:54.568
What are you planning?

393
00:36:54.602 --> 00:36:55.742
- Think
what could happen


394
00:36:55.776 --> 00:36:57.744
if someone who could
predict the stock market


395
00:36:57.778 --> 00:36:59.435
shared that information with
interested dark parties.


396
00:37:01.299 --> 00:37:02.714
I'm sure that's worth
immunity for just one man.


397
00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:07.339
Your own freelance assassins
get carte blanche all the time.


398
00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:09.721
- Oh, fuck you, you little shit.

399
00:37:09.756 --> 00:37:10.998
- Ah, nice to speak
with you, Mr. Johns.


400
00:37:19.075 --> 00:37:20.007
They'll come around.

401
00:37:23.424 --> 00:37:24.909
- So,

402
00:37:27.325 --> 00:37:28.740
what now?

403
00:37:30.362 --> 00:37:32.571
- Finish securing the database.

404
00:37:32.606 --> 00:37:33.503
Tomorrow I have to take a test.

405
00:37:37.024 --> 00:37:38.577
- What test?

406
00:37:40.338 --> 00:37:43.099
Simon, what test?

407
00:38:17.651 --> 00:38:19.791
- You realize my foundation
has been testing claims


408
00:38:19.826 --> 00:38:22.380
of paranormal and
parapsychological powers


409
00:38:22.414 --> 00:38:23.968
for many years now and

410
00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:29.283
no one has ever passed
our stringent procedures.


411
00:38:29.318 --> 00:38:30.940
No one.

412
00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.045
- I'm aware.

413
00:38:32.079 --> 00:38:33.632
- Good.

414
00:38:40.398 --> 00:38:41.882
Right.

415
00:38:42.849 --> 00:38:45.713
Present today are
Jerald Gifford,


416
00:38:45.748 --> 00:38:48.302
who handles all the technical
and logistical issues


417
00:38:48.337 --> 00:38:50.028
here at the lab,

418
00:38:50.063 --> 00:38:52.444
and Miss Scire, who
is out legal advisor.


419
00:38:53.756 --> 00:38:54.653
Take a seat, Simon.

420
00:38:59.382 --> 00:39:01.419
- So,

421
00:39:01.453 --> 00:39:02.627
all the paperwork is in order.

422
00:39:04.802 --> 00:39:08.357
Simon, Mr. Eildon, is away
that if he completes the task,


423
00:39:08.391 --> 00:39:10.911
which in the unanimous
opinion of all of us present,


424
00:39:10.946 --> 00:39:13.811
demonstrates undeniable
proof of PSI powers,


425
00:39:13.845 --> 00:39:14.673
he will be awarded the prize.

426
00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:21.197
As the numeric value of the
Greek letter PSI is 700,


427
00:39:21.232 --> 00:39:24.511
the prize has been sent at the
sum of 700 thousand pounds.


428
00:39:24.545 --> 00:39:26.478
- The satisfactory
completion of the task


429
00:39:26.513 --> 00:39:28.791
will make the first
time in history


430
00:39:28.826 --> 00:39:30.828
that such a feat has been
scientifically ratified.


431
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.623
- This is your
chance to back out.


432
00:39:35.867 --> 00:39:37.317
We publish the names
of all of those


433
00:39:37.351 --> 00:39:38.456
who try and fail the test

434
00:39:40.113 --> 00:39:40.941
and the internet never forgets.

435
00:39:42.978 --> 00:39:44.462
- I'm ready.

436
00:39:44.496 --> 00:39:46.050
- Mr. Brennus,

437
00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:47.534
the protocols require
that the subject


438
00:39:47.568 --> 00:39:48.569
performs the task while alone.

439
00:39:50.675 --> 00:39:52.504
Would you be so kind
as to go next door?


440
00:39:52.539 --> 00:39:53.367
You can view it from there.

441
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.991
- Works with me.

442
00:40:01.617 --> 00:40:02.549
- Many people believe

443
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:08.037
metal bending or spoon
bending is possible,


444
00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.143
even commonplace

445
00:40:10.177 --> 00:40:12.697
but every scientific
assessment disproves the claim.


446
00:40:15.734 --> 00:40:18.358
This is the foolproof
test we have for that.


447
00:40:20.222 --> 00:40:22.120
A metal bar

448
00:40:22.155 --> 00:40:23.915
inside a sealed glass tube.

449
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.402
The test subject must bend the
metal bar without touching it


450
00:40:30.025 --> 00:40:31.026
using only the
power of the mind.


451
00:40:33.476 --> 00:40:35.927
At present, the rode is
as straight as a die.


452
00:40:38.274 --> 00:40:40.656
If at the end of 15 minutes,
the rod remains unchanged,


453
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:41.484
then the challenge will fail.

454
00:40:43.176 --> 00:40:44.729
Are you ready, son?

455
00:40:46.213 --> 00:40:47.732
- Yes.

456
00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:51.460
- Let's begin.

457
00:41:38.507 --> 00:41:40.647
- Oh my God, can you see that?

458
00:41:40.681 --> 00:41:41.786
- Are you recording this?

459
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:43.926
- I'm getting,
I'm getting it!


460
00:41:43.961 --> 00:41:44.996
- I'd never
have believed it


461
00:41:45.031 --> 00:41:46.756
if I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes.


462
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:48.758
- We wouldn't see
history be made here.


463
00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:50.726
This is the first time
ever that the metal bar


464
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.899
has been bent my
mental power alone.


465
00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.044
Congratulations.

466
00:41:58.078 --> 00:41:59.493
What an incredible moment!

467
00:42:02.048 --> 00:42:03.497
- How did you do it?

468
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.190
We have got to share this.

469
00:42:06.224 --> 00:42:09.676
- Mr. Gifford, please, the
rules are perfectly clear


470
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.299
and the contract's
binding on both sides.


471
00:42:12.334 --> 00:42:14.715
Miss Scire, would you please
remove the test equipment,


472
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.303
including the memory
card in the camera,


473
00:42:16.338 --> 00:42:18.857
and secure it in my safe?

474
00:42:18.892 --> 00:42:21.964
Simon, I have pend
many a good year


475
00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:24.656
inviting people to try
and prove the existence


476
00:42:24.691 --> 00:42:25.657
of paranormal phenomenon.

477
00:42:27.659 --> 00:42:28.419
I never believed they would.

478
00:42:30.352 --> 00:42:32.664
It's my deepest privilege

479
00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:35.943
that you came here
to prove me wrong.


480
00:42:36.427 --> 00:42:37.807
- You're welcome.

481
00:42:40.914 --> 00:42:43.779
- He's a threat to
national security.


482
00:42:43.813 --> 00:42:47.472
- There's no obvious crime
we can charge him with.


483
00:42:47.507 --> 00:42:49.854
We have no authority
to detain him.


484
00:42:49.888 --> 00:42:51.614
- He dialed into a
classified phone line.


485
00:42:51.649 --> 00:42:53.478
That is an offense.

486
00:42:53.513 --> 00:42:55.618
- Records will show
it was my phone.


487
00:42:55.653 --> 00:42:58.932
- And we have him on
CCTV stealing that phone.


488
00:42:59.898 --> 00:43:01.417
- True.

489
00:43:03.385 --> 00:43:05.042
- Do we at
least know who he is?

490
00:43:07.147 --> 00:43:09.908
- Facial recognition hasn't
turned up anything yet.


491
00:43:09.943 --> 00:43:12.739
Voice analysis says that
Simon is Scottish and local.


492
00:43:12.773 --> 00:43:14.879
- And the only Steven Brennus
we know of is this guy.


493
00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:16.363
Excess AS.

494
00:43:17.882 --> 00:43:18.986
- Hired
muscle, you think?


495
00:43:19.021 --> 00:43:20.505
- Aye.

496
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.782
- Have we checked him out?

497
00:43:21.817 --> 00:43:23.439
- Special branch
just had a gander.


498
00:43:23.474 --> 00:43:25.303
There's no one at his house.

499
00:43:25.338 --> 00:43:27.340
You got some bodies on the
ground looking for his car.


500
00:43:27.374 --> 00:43:28.858
Stokes?

501
00:43:30.205 --> 00:43:31.620
Sorry, who?

502
00:43:32.483 --> 00:43:34.105
I'm sure that's very exciting

503
00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.624
but it's not exactly our
highest priority right now.


504
00:43:39.076 --> 00:43:40.594
What?

505
00:43:40.629 --> 00:43:43.114
Say that second name again.

506
00:43:43.149 --> 00:43:44.529
- Brennus, Steve Brennus,

507
00:43:46.462 --> 00:43:47.429
a bodyguard or something.

508
00:43:49.396 --> 00:43:50.501
Who cares about him?

509
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.092
It's what this young Simon
guy did that's so amazing.


510
00:43:56.921 --> 00:43:58.405
He can move things
with his mind.


511
00:43:59.855 --> 00:44:01.960
- Can you describe this Simon?

512
00:44:03.652 --> 00:44:05.412
- Since when do we
keep tabs on psychics?


513
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:13.282
- Our colonial cousins have
wasted millions of dollars


514
00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:14.559
to try to track
potential psychics.


515
00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.358
We prefer to simply monitor
a few reliable institutions


516
00:44:20.393 --> 00:44:22.084
who unwittingly do
the vetting for us.


517
00:44:25.846 --> 00:44:26.985
The odd informant
here and there.


518
00:44:28.746 --> 00:44:31.093
Much more cost effective.

519
00:44:31.128 --> 00:44:32.681
- Okay.

520
00:44:32.715 --> 00:44:33.475
Have you got their details?

521
00:44:39.895 --> 00:44:40.930
- Right, what the
hell was that all about?


522
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:47.903
- Okay, so truth is I
can't do telekinesis.


523
00:44:47.937 --> 00:44:50.492
Believe me, I have tried
to move things with my mind


524
00:44:50.526 --> 00:44:53.633
but I'm just not strong enough.

525
00:44:53.667 --> 00:44:56.394
It's like trying to lift a
weight with my little finger.


526
00:44:56.429 --> 00:44:57.775
- Well the buffoons in there

527
00:44:57.809 --> 00:44:59.673
were still wetting their
pants though, weren't they?


528
00:44:59.708 --> 00:45:01.123
- Yeah, well, putting
thoughts in people's minds


529
00:45:01.158 --> 00:45:02.676
is a tad easier.

530
00:45:04.678 --> 00:45:07.129
Look, I just made them
believe the metal was bending.


531
00:45:07.164 --> 00:45:10.028
Whether it's confusing people
or seeing into the future,


532
00:45:10.063 --> 00:45:11.616
it works better if I have
a personal connection.


533
00:45:11.651 --> 00:45:13.170
- Like with the killer?

534
00:45:13.204 --> 00:45:14.999
- And doing the test.

535
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.760
Look, if I die,

536
00:45:17.795 --> 00:45:18.761
the world should know I existed.

537
00:45:21.247 --> 00:45:22.869
I have another reason as well.

538
00:45:24.457 --> 00:45:25.768
It'll also persuade
certain people


539
00:45:25.803 --> 00:45:27.667
that we should be
taken seriously.


540
00:45:31.533 --> 00:45:34.052
- You gonna tell me who?

541
00:45:34.087 --> 00:45:35.606
- Nope.

542
00:45:36.262 --> 00:45:37.780
- Fine.

543
00:45:38.436 --> 00:45:40.024
Don't wanna know anyway.

544
00:46:21.548 --> 00:46:23.481
All right, who the hell's this?

545
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:34.492
- Mr. Simon Eildon, Mr. Steven
Brennus, you're under arrest.


546
00:46:34.527 --> 00:46:35.700
- On what charge?

547
00:46:35.735 --> 00:46:36.563
- Endangering nation security.

548
00:46:38.116 --> 00:46:39.601
- And nicking my phone.

549
00:46:55.133 --> 00:46:56.100
- I'm guessing you
didn't foresee this.


550
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:59.379
- Not an exact
science, remember.


551
00:47:03.797 --> 00:47:04.695
- And who do love
when you're at home?


552
00:47:07.353 --> 00:47:08.077
- The people who
run the country.


553
00:47:09.631 --> 00:47:11.046
Not the politicians.

554
00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.772
The people who are
really in charge.


555
00:47:14.567 --> 00:47:16.085
- And what about these?

556
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:18.364
- Can't you make them
magically disappear?


557
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.024
- We'll allow it.

558
00:47:30.617 --> 00:47:32.550
- No matter what
they do with you,


559
00:47:32.585 --> 00:47:34.345
I'm gonna make sure the
hold you end up in


560
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.760
will be as uncomfortable
as possible.


561
00:47:40.075 --> 00:47:40.800
- Quite a history you have here.

562
00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:44.562
Fascinating.

563
00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:48.325
- The immunity?

564
00:47:49.395 --> 00:47:51.328
- Oh, for God sake,
give it to him


565
00:47:51.362 --> 00:47:52.777
so we can get started.

566
00:48:05.687 --> 00:48:08.793
- Have you seen
who's signed this?


567
00:48:08.828 --> 00:48:10.347
So,

568
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.179
I could kill anyone in
this room right now


569
00:48:15.213 --> 00:48:15.904
and you couldn't press charges.

570
00:48:19.045 --> 00:48:20.495
- Highly amusing.

571
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.429
So,

572
00:48:23.912 --> 00:48:25.569
just for the record,

573
00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:26.880
former corporal
Brennus of the SAS,


574
00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:30.712
what precisely is your
involvement in this?


575
00:48:32.438 --> 00:48:33.887
- I'm the lad's driver

576
00:48:34.405 --> 00:48:35.820
and I like this job.

577
00:48:38.409 --> 00:48:39.790
- Very good.

578
00:48:42.448 --> 00:48:44.035
Mr. Simon Eildon.

579
00:48:45.243 --> 00:48:48.281
According to this file, you
claim to have a telepathic link.


580
00:48:48.315 --> 00:48:50.041
- It's not telepathy.

581
00:48:50.076 --> 00:48:52.354
I can't read minds.

582
00:48:52.389 --> 00:48:54.598
It's more of a limited
clairvoyance.


583
00:48:56.876 --> 00:49:00.051
- A link with a
supposed serial killer


584
00:49:00.086 --> 00:49:02.537
whose alleged crimes
are unsubstantiated.


585
00:49:04.159 --> 00:49:05.678
Please, explain.

586
00:49:08.025 --> 00:49:10.234
- I believe that my
fear of him prevents me


587
00:49:10.268 --> 00:49:12.305
from making a useful connection.

588
00:49:12.339 --> 00:49:14.411
We've met once.

589
00:49:14.445 --> 00:49:16.965
- Ah, yes, according to you,

590
00:49:16.999 --> 00:49:19.139
this was the man
responsible for the murder


591
00:49:19.174 --> 00:49:22.453
that you witnessed when
you were eight years old.


592
00:49:22.488 --> 00:49:25.732
Victim's name was a Catholic
priest, Father Cavanagh.


593
00:49:30.047 --> 00:49:32.256
- Father!

594
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:33.084
I was born of sin.

595
00:49:34.672 --> 00:49:36.398
A man of the cloth.

596
00:49:36.433 --> 00:49:38.124
Ye,

597
00:49:38.158 --> 00:49:38.987
my real father,

598
00:49:40.851 --> 00:49:42.369
conceived in Hell
by the good man.


599
00:49:45.511 --> 00:49:49.204
Here is your punishment
for your grave sin!


600
00:49:51.482 --> 00:49:54.692
- Listen, boy, pay attention!

601
00:49:54.727 --> 00:49:57.005
You're just one step
away from a private cell


602
00:49:57.039 --> 00:49:58.524
with very few
opportunities for parole.


603
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.376
- You're the guy, right?

604
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:24.929
The one on the chat forum?

605
00:50:30.452 --> 00:50:32.040
- Did you bring it?

606
00:50:32.074 --> 00:50:33.835
- Who are you anyway?

607
00:50:33.869 --> 00:50:36.078
What do you want
with this stuff?


608
00:50:39.461 --> 00:50:40.635
- Science is a
competitive business.


609
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.673
Universities.

610
00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.503
Private academic institutions.

611
00:50:49.782 --> 00:50:50.886
They need to know what
their rivals are up to.


612
00:50:52.578 --> 00:50:54.407
When it comes to a potentially

613
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:56.478
explosive discovery like this,

614
00:50:58.204 --> 00:50:59.688
well, it has value.

615
00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.729
- So did you bring
what I asked for?


616
00:51:16.981 --> 00:51:18.569
Oh, baby.

617
00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:22.331
Oh yeah.

618
00:51:22.884 --> 00:51:24.402
Sorry.

619
00:51:25.576 --> 00:51:26.819
This is all I could get.

620
00:51:26.853 --> 00:51:27.820
This guy, Simon.

621
00:51:30.098 --> 00:51:30.961
Personal details.

622
00:51:30.995 --> 00:51:32.376
- His address.

623
00:51:33.032 --> 00:51:34.447
- Of course.

624
00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:39.279
- We can have you rot in prison.

625
00:51:39.314 --> 00:51:42.179
- Detention isn't the answer.

626
00:51:42.213 --> 00:51:45.320
You obviously want to understand
and improve your abilities.


627
00:51:45.354 --> 00:51:48.495
A top of the rang scientific
establishment is what you need.


628
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:50.739
- I have what I need.

629
00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:53.328
- But think of the
resources we could provide.


630
00:51:53.362 --> 00:51:54.985
Experts in neural science,

631
00:51:55.019 --> 00:51:56.262
physiology,

632
00:51:56.296 --> 00:51:57.815
subatomic physics.

633
00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.059
- Not interested.

634
00:52:00.093 --> 00:52:01.992
- What do you want, money?

635
00:52:02.026 --> 00:52:03.303
- I've got money.

636
00:52:03.338 --> 00:52:05.547
- We can give you more.

637
00:52:05.582 --> 00:52:06.997
- I have enough to
getting on with.


638
00:52:07.031 --> 00:52:09.378
- Then what do you want?

639
00:52:09.413 --> 00:52:10.621
- I want to get out of here.

640
00:52:12.761 --> 00:52:14.142
- I don't think that's
gonna happen very soon.


641
00:52:14.176 --> 00:52:15.350
In fact--

642
00:52:15.384 --> 00:52:16.247
- Jesus, Simon!

643
00:52:16.282 --> 00:52:16.938
- Jesus Christ!

644
00:52:16.972 --> 00:52:18.698
- Simon!

645
00:52:21.494 --> 00:52:22.460
- Jesus.

646
00:52:30.123 --> 00:52:30.952
- I'll get help.

647
00:52:30.986 --> 00:52:32.401
- No you won't.

648
00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:35.612
He doesn't need any help.

649
00:52:35.646 --> 00:52:37.475
Just give him a few seconds.

650
00:52:41.272 --> 00:52:43.309
- He's dying, for Christ sake!

651
00:52:43.343 --> 00:52:45.622
- Just give
him a few seconds!


652
00:52:45.656 --> 00:52:48.417
You might actually learn
something about who this lad is.


653
00:52:48.452 --> 00:52:49.315
- He's got no pulse.

654
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:50.350
- Just

655
00:52:50.385 --> 00:52:51.282
wait.

656
00:53:21.485 --> 00:53:22.866
- Mr. Stokes!

657
00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.621
- No hidden pockets,

658
00:53:54.656 --> 00:53:56.554
no cutting edges, no
devices, nothing.


659
00:54:00.386 --> 00:54:02.146
- There must be something.

660
00:54:02.181 --> 00:54:03.630
It's a trick.

661
00:54:03.665 --> 00:54:05.149
- That one seemed different.

662
00:54:05.184 --> 00:54:06.012
- It was.

663
00:54:06.047 --> 00:54:07.324
Quick.

664
00:54:07.358 --> 00:54:09.257
Very unusual.

665
00:54:09.291 --> 00:54:10.016
- He didn't torture
or hurt them?


666
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:12.156
- No.

667
00:54:12.191 --> 00:54:13.813
It's like he wanted something
so he just killed to get it.


668
00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:17.955
He's killing more often
and more frequently.


669
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:19.577
We need to stop him.

670
00:54:19.612 --> 00:54:20.751
- Which means getting
out of here.


671
00:54:20.786 --> 00:54:21.821
- So
what did we just witness?


672
00:54:21.856 --> 00:54:23.754
- Somewhere.

673
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:25.687
- Is there any chance of
getting your attention?


674
00:54:25.722 --> 00:54:28.000
A small matter of
nation security.


675
00:54:28.034 --> 00:54:29.173
- What's the time?

676
00:54:29.208 --> 00:54:30.830
- What?

677
00:54:30.865 --> 00:54:31.969
- The time.

678
00:54:32.004 --> 00:54:34.523
- 4:17, why?

679
00:54:34.558 --> 00:54:37.941
- Because if it's 4:17,
then 15 minutes ago


680
00:54:37.975 --> 00:54:40.806
the USS Carolina, a
Virginia class submarine


681
00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.153
currently docked at
the Faslane Naval Base,


682
00:54:43.187 --> 00:54:44.706
less than 80 miles from here

683
00:54:44.741 --> 00:54:46.466
developed a fault in the wiring

684
00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:48.296
associated with a
nuclear reactor.


685
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:49.331
- Now look here!
- Be quiet!


686
00:54:51.264 --> 00:54:54.164
- The problem is valve 11-27-30.

687
00:54:54.198 --> 00:54:55.613
For some reason it's opened
when it should be closed.


688
00:54:58.133 --> 00:54:59.756
- Wait for status.

689
00:55:01.758 --> 00:55:03.276
- Simon?

690
00:55:08.247 --> 00:55:08.937
- Did you open that valve?

691
00:55:11.837 --> 00:55:13.528
- The same valve has
a universal fitting


692
00:55:13.562 --> 00:55:16.289
on other US Nuclear Navy subs.

693
00:55:16.324 --> 00:55:18.982
Not to mention the
entire UK Trident fleet


694
00:55:19.016 --> 00:55:21.329
currently on an exercise
just off the coast of Norway.


695
00:55:21.363 --> 00:55:22.848
- That's classified.

696
00:55:22.882 --> 00:55:24.297
- But true.

697
00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.060
- A faulty valve in a
dry dock submarine


698
00:55:28.094 --> 00:55:30.269
is obviously a problem

699
00:55:30.303 --> 00:55:31.788
but it can be remedied.

700
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:36.551
The same faulty valve in
a sub at sea, however,


701
00:55:36.585 --> 00:55:38.242
that's a disaster.

702
00:55:39.554 --> 00:55:40.831
It would be a terrible
thing if someone were


703
00:55:40.866 --> 00:55:43.144
to open the valve
at the wrong time.


704
00:55:43.178 --> 00:55:44.766
- What is it that you want?

705
00:55:45.525 --> 00:55:47.942
- Guarantee Steven's immunity

706
00:55:47.976 --> 00:55:50.082
that you're not just going
to rip it up when we leave.


707
00:55:50.116 --> 00:55:52.256
Promise not try to detain us

708
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:54.880
and just let us go.

709
00:55:54.914 --> 00:55:56.467
- That's it?

710
00:55:58.193 --> 00:55:59.643
- Once we're out of your
hair, the subs will be safe,


711
00:56:01.127 --> 00:56:02.784
including the Carolina.

712
00:56:14.347 --> 00:56:15.935
- Do me a favor.

713
00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:17.937
- What's that?

714
00:56:17.972 --> 00:56:21.699
- If I'm ever tempted to play
poker with you, shoot me.


715
00:56:21.734 --> 00:56:24.702
You're the chanciest, ballsy
bloke that I ever met.


716
00:56:30.847 --> 00:56:32.400
Oh, they're good.

717
00:56:32.434 --> 00:56:33.780
- What do you mean?

718
00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.955
- Well, you wouldn't know
they searched the place.


719
00:56:39.476 --> 00:56:41.305
Look, how are you doing?

720
00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.686
- Yeah, fine.

721
00:56:44.032 --> 00:56:45.447
I'm just a bit tired.

722
00:56:46.138 --> 00:56:48.174
- Yeah.

723
00:56:48.209 --> 00:56:49.451
I'll go and order some pizza.

724
00:56:49.486 --> 00:56:50.694
Do you want a cup of tea?

725
00:56:50.728 --> 00:56:52.247
- Yeah.

726
00:56:58.633 --> 00:56:59.945
Father.

727
00:57:35.566 --> 00:57:36.913
- He's at rest now.

728
00:57:39.743 --> 00:57:40.433
- I should've stopped it.

729
00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.267
- You can't fix
everything, Simon.


730
00:57:48.614 --> 00:57:49.649
And sometimes bad thing happen.

731
00:57:55.103 --> 00:57:57.830
I don't think the world
is ready for you yet.


732
00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:01.282
It may never be.

733
00:58:25.685 --> 00:58:27.860
- Hello?
- Simon?


734
00:58:28.861 --> 00:58:30.863
Professor Richet, here.

735
00:58:30.897 --> 00:58:34.004
I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you.


736
00:58:34.039 --> 00:58:35.350
As you know, we were
going to announce


737
00:58:35.385 --> 00:58:37.870
your success in the morning.

738
00:58:37.904 --> 00:58:39.320
I'm afraid we're going
to have to postpone.


739
00:58:41.943 --> 00:58:43.255
Our colleague, Mr.
Gifford, has gone missing.


740
00:58:46.016 --> 00:58:47.569
We fear something may
have happened to him.


741
00:59:04.172 --> 00:59:05.587
- What's up?

742
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.625
- It's over.

743
00:59:23.536 --> 00:59:25.538
- Let us silence the blasphemer.

744
00:59:34.823 --> 00:59:37.343
- Simon, you can't just
fire me like that.


745
00:59:37.378 --> 00:59:39.828
- I can and I am.

746
00:59:39.863 --> 00:59:41.451
- Like hell you are.

747
00:59:41.485 --> 00:59:42.348
- Look, if it's about the money,

748
00:59:42.383 --> 00:59:43.832
I'll pay you the full amount.

749
00:59:43.867 --> 00:59:45.041
- All right, Simon,

750
00:59:45.075 --> 00:59:47.284
what's this craziness
that's in your head now?


751
00:59:47.319 --> 00:59:48.768
- I started all of this

752
00:59:48.803 --> 00:59:50.736
but I didn't think
through the consequence,


753
00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:52.151
I didn't foresee
what could happen.


754
00:59:52.186 --> 00:59:53.670
- So what?

755
00:59:53.704 --> 00:59:55.051
Welcome to what it's
like for the rest of us.


756
00:59:55.085 --> 00:59:56.431
- You don't understand.

757
00:59:56.466 --> 00:59:58.502
Someone else has died.

758
00:59:58.537 --> 00:59:59.883
One of the scientists.

759
00:59:59.917 --> 01:00:01.574
The killer murdered
him because of me


760
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:03.921
because of what I
did, I'm responsible.


761
01:00:03.956 --> 01:00:05.164
- You're the one responsible
for being an asshole.


762
01:00:05.199 --> 01:00:07.373
You didn't kill him.

763
01:00:07.408 --> 01:00:09.444
- You need to look after
Christine and Sally.


764
01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:11.619
- And what are you
gonna do, huh?


765
01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:13.655
Muscle up to a
killer on your own?


766
01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:15.657
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do, all right?


767
01:00:15.692 --> 01:00:17.383
- Because I would show my
hairy ass and jog a short wind


768
01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:18.591
if I thought you
could even fight


769
01:00:18.626 --> 01:00:20.283
your way out of a
paper fucking bag.


770
01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:21.663
- Oh, spare me the
tough guy act.


771
01:00:21.698 --> 01:00:23.009
- Oh fuck off, that's
why you hired me!


772
01:00:23.044 --> 01:00:24.080
You're a weakling.

773
01:00:24.114 --> 01:00:25.598
- I have powers!

774
01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:26.944
- Yeah, and what have
you done with them?


775
01:00:26.979 --> 01:00:28.567
You know, you could
rule the world


776
01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:30.603
but you're just a
fucking whinger!


777
01:00:30.638 --> 01:00:31.535
- At least I'm
not a washed-up has been!


778
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.503
- No, you're "never was."

779
01:00:33.537 --> 01:00:35.056
You've been hiding behind
your mom's skirts for years!


780
01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:36.713
- And you're a child batterer!

781
01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:47.689
- Think I'll go
make some more tea.


782
01:01:25.555 --> 01:01:27.315
- Daddy!
- Steve, hi.


783
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.731
- Hey.

784
01:01:29.766 --> 01:01:31.181
- I thought you'd be a bit
more pleased to see us.


785
01:01:31.216 --> 01:01:32.872
- Sorry.

786
01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.360
- She wants to know why

787
01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:38.775
you're wearing a
plaster on your head.


788
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:40.294
- Oh.

789
01:01:42.158 --> 01:01:44.125
- Did someone hurt you, Daddy?

790
01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.369
- Yeah, they did.

791
01:01:46.403 --> 01:01:48.405
- Was that because
you were naughty?


792
01:01:51.546 --> 01:01:53.583
- She thinks that you hit
her because she was naughty.


793
01:01:57.034 --> 01:01:58.277
- You shouldn't sneak about

794
01:01:58.312 --> 01:01:59.899
and listen to other
people talking.


795
01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:03.489
- You did nothing
wrong, sweetheart.


796
01:02:04.973 --> 01:02:06.009
You weren't naughty.

797
01:02:06.043 --> 01:02:08.253
It was Daddy who was naughty

798
01:02:08.287 --> 01:02:09.771
for losing his temper and
hitting the door, wasn't it?


799
01:02:12.464 --> 01:02:15.260
I'm so sorry I hurt you,
sweetheart, I'm so very sorry.


800
01:02:15.294 --> 01:02:18.228
- It's okay, it
doesn't hurt anymore.


801
01:02:18.263 --> 01:02:20.886
- Listen, darling, why don't
you go off and play just now?


802
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.888
Okay?

803
01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:24.855
Mommy and Daddy need to talk
about some grownup stuff.


804
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:26.512
- See you soon.

805
01:02:31.586 --> 01:02:32.553
Is she really okay?

806
01:02:33.968 --> 01:02:35.487
- Yeah.

807
01:02:36.108 --> 01:02:37.834
- I miss you.

808
01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.181
- I miss you too.

809
01:02:40.906 --> 01:02:42.528
- Are we okay?

810
01:02:42.977 --> 01:02:45.186
- That depends.

811
01:02:45.221 --> 01:02:47.015
What's going on, Steve, are
you mixed up in something bad?


812
01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:48.258
- No.

813
01:02:48.293 --> 01:02:49.846
Why?

814
01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.573
- Well, today Mom's
local highland policeman


815
01:02:52.607 --> 01:02:55.886
drove 35 miles of winding
back road to come here


816
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:57.888
and ask whether you'd
ever been involved in any


817
01:02:57.923 --> 01:03:00.546
major criminal
activities or terrorism.


818
01:03:00.581 --> 01:03:02.583
- What did she say?

819
01:03:02.617 --> 01:03:04.447
- Mom made him a cup of tea

820
01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.379
and they both talked
about the problems


821
01:03:05.413 --> 01:03:06.828
they had with potato bugs.

822
01:03:06.863 --> 01:03:08.416
I don't think it was any
bother to you, to be honest,


823
01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.866
but there is something else.

824
01:03:11.868 --> 01:03:14.905
Two minutes ago I get
a text from the bank.


825
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.700
Steve, why have we suddenly
acquired 700 thousand pounds?


826
01:03:16.735 --> 01:03:18.081
- 700?

827
01:03:20.704 --> 01:03:22.810
Babes, I need to go,
can I call you later?


828
01:03:22.844 --> 01:03:24.260
I love you.

829
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.676
Simon!

830
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:27.366
What the?

831
01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:31.784
- Shit.

832
01:03:36.306 --> 01:03:37.825
Whoops.

833
01:03:46.005 --> 01:03:47.352
Sorry, Steve.

834
01:03:48.214 --> 01:03:49.906
I have to do this on my own.

835
01:03:57.154 --> 01:03:58.915
Who is it?

836
01:03:58.949 --> 01:04:01.262
- Pizza delivery.

837
01:04:01.297 --> 01:04:03.747
- Could you just
leave it outside?


838
01:04:03.782 --> 01:04:05.370
- Sorry, I
still need the cash.


839
01:04:05.404 --> 01:04:06.267
- All right, just a minute.

840
01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.829
- You still there?

841
01:04:34.226 --> 01:04:35.848
- Mr. Brennus?

842
01:04:40.853 --> 01:04:42.579
- What's going on?

843
01:04:42.614 --> 01:04:43.304
- Simon's been taken.

844
01:05:21.204 --> 01:05:23.379
We think he was grabbed by the
killer you were going after.


845
01:05:23.413 --> 01:05:24.656
Did you see anything?

846
01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:26.658
- No.

847
01:05:26.692 --> 01:05:27.728
No, I was out cold
before anything happened.


848
01:05:30.903 --> 01:05:32.388
Simon knocked me out.

849
01:05:33.906 --> 01:05:35.391
Yeah.

850
01:05:36.978 --> 01:05:37.945
- So that's what all
that noise was about.


851
01:05:40.396 --> 01:05:41.983
We bugged the place.

852
01:05:42.536 --> 01:05:44.503
- Of course you did.

853
01:05:44.538 --> 01:05:45.401
- We managed to get
a particle plate.


854
01:05:45.435 --> 01:05:46.229
Checking now.

855
01:05:46.263 --> 01:05:47.230
- Simon's phone?

856
01:05:47.264 --> 01:05:48.611
- Tracking it.

857
01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:36.900
- All these glimpses
of the future


858
01:06:36.935 --> 01:06:39.662
but he couldn't see what
shit was coming down on him.


859
01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:42.458
- He knew exactly
what was coming,


860
01:06:42.492 --> 01:06:43.424
it's just that some
people didn't listen.


861
01:06:47.773 --> 01:06:49.465
- Joseph Cavanagh.

862
01:06:49.879 --> 01:06:51.328
My uncle.

863
01:06:54.504 --> 01:06:56.817
- He was the priest that
married Christine in me.


864
01:07:01.028 --> 01:07:02.823
- Did you go to the funeral?

865
01:07:02.857 --> 01:07:04.376
- Yeah, of course.

866
01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:08.000
- Do you remember a young
boy stood at the back?


867
01:07:08.035 --> 01:07:10.865
Very quiet, crying a lot.

868
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.453
- Yeah.

869
01:07:13.143 --> 01:07:14.904
- I didn't know who he was.

870
01:07:14.938 --> 01:07:16.733
He shook my hand.

871
01:07:16.768 --> 01:07:18.424
- Yeah, mine too.

872
01:07:18.459 --> 01:07:19.909
Jesus, Simon.

873
01:07:19.943 --> 01:07:22.014
- That's how he's
connected to you and me.


874
01:07:22.049 --> 01:07:23.671
Why he's approached us.

875
01:07:25.224 --> 01:07:26.571
- This is new.

876
01:07:28.331 --> 01:07:29.781
"Father and son."

877
01:07:29.815 --> 01:07:31.058
The son of a priest!

878
01:07:31.092 --> 01:07:32.162
- Jesus Christ.

879
01:07:32.197 --> 01:07:33.198
- The son of a fucking...

880
01:07:33.232 --> 01:07:34.268
The killer's your cousin!

881
01:07:34.302 --> 01:07:35.407
The killer's your
fucking cousin!


882
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:36.373
What's his name?

883
01:07:36.408 --> 01:07:37.858
You must know it!

884
01:07:37.892 --> 01:07:38.548
- No.

885
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:40.930
My uncle must've kept
his existence a secret.


886
01:07:43.588 --> 01:07:45.935
There's nothing known in the
family about any of this.


887
01:07:45.969 --> 01:07:46.936
About any kind of a scandal.

888
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:48.489
- No luck on the mobile.

889
01:07:48.524 --> 01:07:49.663
Still searching for
the van's plates.


890
01:07:49.697 --> 01:07:51.527
- The van?

891
01:07:51.561 --> 01:07:53.563
- Yeah, I caught just a
glimpse of it as it drove off.


892
01:07:53.598 --> 01:07:55.461
- We think CCTV picked him
up heading toward the city


893
01:07:55.496 --> 01:07:56.186
but we're still checking.

894
01:08:06.127 --> 01:08:07.888
- Where the hell are you going?

895
01:08:07.922 --> 01:08:09.579
- Your man said the van was
heading into town, right?


896
01:08:09.614 --> 01:08:10.546
Let me know when you
have a position.


897
01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.616
- You're not part
of this operation.


898
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.134
- Wrong.

899
01:08:13.169 --> 01:08:14.826
The boy hired me to protect him

900
01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.172
and he grabbed him from
right underneath my nose.


901
01:08:17.035 --> 01:08:18.243
Come on!

902
01:08:19.727 --> 01:08:21.177
Jesus Christ!

903
01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:23.938
- Who dares wins.

904
01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:36.986
- There are three vans
that match that partial.


905
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.366
One belongs to a rental agency.

906
01:08:38.401 --> 01:08:39.057
- It wasn't a rental.

907
01:08:39.091 --> 01:08:40.541
Too old.

908
01:08:40.576 --> 01:08:42.267
- Two options then.

909
01:08:42.301 --> 01:08:44.856
Did you see anything
else at all?


910
01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:47.203
- Caught a flash of a sign
on the side of the van.


911
01:08:47.237 --> 01:08:48.860
Faded lettering..

912
01:08:49.964 --> 01:08:51.932
An image of something.

913
01:09:37.598 --> 01:09:39.048
- Trying the address one
if the vans is registered.


914
01:09:39.082 --> 01:09:40.670
No answer so far.

915
01:09:40.705 --> 01:09:43.777
- That paint work, it
was some kind of garage.


916
01:09:43.811 --> 01:09:45.641
- One of the vans used to
belong to a kinda body shop


917
01:09:45.675 --> 01:09:47.573
or metal works.

918
01:09:47.608 --> 01:09:49.955
- According to this it went
out of business years ago.


919
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:51.681
The whole area's derelict.

920
01:09:51.716 --> 01:09:52.682
- All right, tell the
blokes to get down there.


921
01:09:52.717 --> 01:09:55.374
Sir, we know where
he's taking Simon.


922
01:09:55.409 --> 01:09:56.686
- That's of little
consequence right now.


923
01:09:56.721 --> 01:09:57.791
- Sir?

924
01:09:57.825 --> 01:10:00.448
- There will be
no close pursuit.


925
01:10:00.483 --> 01:10:01.829
- But, sir,
Simon's been taken.


926
01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.694
- The problem with the USS
Carolina has been resolved


927
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:05.799
and the rest of our
subs are unaffected.


928
01:10:08.733 --> 01:10:09.768
We know we cannot tolerate
a similar incident.


929
01:10:12.633 --> 01:10:13.945
Orders are that Simon
Eildon is to be eliminated.


930
01:10:15.601 --> 01:10:16.879
- No!

931
01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:18.846
- It seems that this
fortuitous kidnapper


932
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.399
will save us the trouble.

933
01:10:21.228 --> 01:10:22.816
- You've gotta be kidding.

934
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:24.714
- And then we will
perform our public duty


935
01:10:24.749 --> 01:10:26.820
of arresting a
terrible serial killer


936
01:10:26.854 --> 01:10:28.166
as he stands over the
body of his latest victim.


937
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.722
Such a great tragedy that
the forces of law and order


938
01:10:32.757 --> 01:10:33.619
where not able to
get there on time.


939
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:36.726
But we did get our
man in the end.


940
01:10:39.142 --> 01:10:40.903
And those things do play
rather well with the press.


941
01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:31.263
- Amen.

942
01:11:36.855 --> 01:11:37.614
Behold the man.

943
01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:05.737
Huh?

944
01:13:06.911 --> 01:13:08.429
What?

945
01:13:14.677 --> 01:13:15.851
- You don't remember me, do you?

946
01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:20.510
The church.

947
01:13:22.374 --> 01:13:23.168
When you killed your father.

948
01:13:27.932 --> 01:13:28.760
- Interfering boy.

949
01:13:30.935 --> 01:13:32.453
The witness.

950
01:13:39.357 --> 01:13:42.360
Both of us cast adrift
by the same tragedy


951
01:13:44.638 --> 01:13:46.882
brought together
again by providence.


952
01:13:48.953 --> 01:13:50.402
Such divine symmetry.

953
01:14:04.037 --> 01:14:05.762
- Mr. Brennus?

954
01:14:05.797 --> 01:14:07.109
Can you hear me?

955
01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:09.525
- What do you got for me?

956
01:14:09.559 --> 01:14:10.802
- I'm sending you
the directions now.


957
01:14:13.218 --> 01:14:14.702
- Got it.

958
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:22.469
- Hurry.

959
01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.203
- Heavenly father looks
after all His children,


960
01:14:32.237 --> 01:14:35.206
cares for them and
protects them.


961
01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.829
But my father

962
01:14:37.863 --> 01:14:40.901
rejected his own sacred
duty to do the same.


963
01:14:44.767 --> 01:14:47.459
So tortured by the
gilt of his sins


964
01:14:49.323 --> 01:14:51.256
and the lust of
this corrupt flesh


965
01:14:53.776 --> 01:14:56.158
that he couldn't even
bear to hold me.


966
01:14:58.298 --> 01:15:00.162
I was punished just
for being born.


967
01:15:15.763 --> 01:15:17.489
- Fuck!

968
01:15:17.938 --> 01:15:19.767
- It must be nearby.

969
01:15:19.802 --> 01:15:23.047
Some place called Skin
Flats Metal Works.


970
01:15:23.081 --> 01:15:25.049
Oh and it looks like our killer

971
01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:26.671
was also trained in the army.

972
01:15:28.535 --> 01:15:31.055
Dishonorably discharged
for unstable behavior.


973
01:15:31.089 --> 01:15:32.642
- Fucking great.

974
01:15:32.677 --> 01:15:34.161
Okay.

975
01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.758
- My father cared more about
the strangers in his flock


976
01:15:46.415 --> 01:15:47.174
than his own flesh and blood.

977
01:15:49.142 --> 01:15:51.420
- Is that why you killed him?

978
01:15:51.454 --> 01:15:52.248
Because of a
neglected childhood?


979
01:15:53.491 --> 01:15:55.872
- No.

980
01:15:55.907 --> 01:15:59.221
I killed him because he placed
his faith above his duty.


981
01:16:03.984 --> 01:16:08.264
And at confessional I told
him time and time again


982
01:16:08.299 --> 01:16:09.300
I was going to kill someone.

983
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.510
I even gave him the dead!

984
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:28.112
But does he tell the police?

985
01:16:28.146 --> 01:16:28.871
Have me arrested?

986
01:16:30.804 --> 01:16:34.428
No, he knew what was
going to happen


987
01:16:34.463 --> 01:16:36.465
but he did nothing to change it!

988
01:16:44.749 --> 01:16:48.511
The sacred trust of
the confessional


989
01:16:48.546 --> 01:16:51.859
triumphed over the
value of a human life.


990
01:16:56.174 --> 01:16:57.727
- Simon!

991
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:00.696
- For I am there

992
01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.907
with the rod and the staff!

993
01:17:04.941 --> 01:17:06.564
I humble thee!

994
01:17:12.742 --> 01:17:14.261
- Simon!

995
01:17:43.394 --> 01:17:46.707
- They said
you had special gifts.


996
01:17:46.742 --> 01:17:48.226
- Yes.

997
01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:51.160
- Lies!

998
01:17:51.195 --> 01:17:52.679
Filth!

999
01:17:53.956 --> 01:17:55.854
They speak only to me!

1000
01:17:55.889 --> 01:17:57.442
To me!

1001
01:17:57.477 --> 01:17:59.962
I am the soul messenger!

1002
01:17:59.996 --> 01:18:03.483
All others are false prophets!

1003
01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:05.278
It is only through
me that they speak!


1004
01:18:14.804 --> 01:18:15.702
I used to be alone.

1005
01:18:19.154 --> 01:18:20.189
But then the voices came.

1006
01:18:22.018 --> 01:18:23.158
The voices of truth.

1007
01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.126
The pure ones.

1008
01:18:28.577 --> 01:18:30.130
The winged dwellers
of light and majesty.


1009
01:18:32.995 --> 01:18:34.617
- You're talking about angels.

1010
01:18:45.214 --> 01:18:46.595
- You can hear them too,

1011
01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:50.944
funneling their power.

1012
01:18:58.848 --> 01:19:00.229
The scourging is complete.

1013
01:19:03.094 --> 01:19:04.682
Through my will and authority

1014
01:19:06.477 --> 01:19:08.893
I do that which is preordained.

1015
01:19:16.797 --> 01:19:18.454
- Chatham,
he's not here!


1016
01:19:18.489 --> 01:19:20.215
Chatham?

1017
01:19:21.077 --> 01:19:22.872
Chatham, are you there?

1018
01:19:22.907 --> 01:19:24.460
Jesus Christ!

1019
01:19:27.118 --> 01:19:28.844
- Now,

1020
01:19:29.845 --> 01:19:32.365
must come the cleansing

1021
01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:35.264
where you sins are many

1022
01:19:35.299 --> 01:19:36.886
and they must be washed away.

1023
01:19:47.138 --> 01:19:47.863
It is finished.

1024
01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:13.302
- Jesus Christ!

1025
01:20:18.238 --> 01:20:19.757
Come on!

1026
01:21:01.799 --> 01:21:03.248
Fuck sake.

1027
01:21:05.389 --> 01:21:06.493
Constitution Street?

1028
01:21:32.623 --> 01:21:34.141
Simon!

1029
01:21:36.454 --> 01:21:37.835
- Sir.

1030
01:21:37.869 --> 01:21:39.837
Owner of the metal
works is ex-military.


1031
01:21:39.871 --> 01:21:41.390
Discharged before the
first tour of duty.


1032
01:21:41.425 --> 01:21:42.840
Should we intervene?

1033
01:21:42.874 --> 01:21:44.359
- No.

1034
01:21:45.429 --> 01:21:46.361
Let's just see how it plays out.

1035
01:21:51.711 --> 01:21:53.264
- Simon!

1036
01:22:12.076 --> 01:22:13.560
Simon!

1037
01:22:14.837 --> 01:22:16.356
Simon!

1038
01:23:51.796 --> 01:23:53.211
- All this time

1039
01:23:54.212 --> 01:23:56.629
I thought you were a devil,

1040
01:23:56.663 --> 01:23:57.353
a monster.

1041
01:24:04.119 --> 01:24:07.122
But you're just a
sad, broken man.


1042
01:24:07.156 --> 01:24:08.710
No!

1043
01:24:52.063 --> 01:24:52.892
- Abomination!

1044
01:24:55.964 --> 01:24:57.413
Imposter!

1045
01:24:58.449 --> 01:24:59.761
- Simon!

1046
01:25:01.417 --> 01:25:02.487
Simon, let him go!

1047
01:25:30.481 --> 01:25:31.793
- Simon!

1048
01:26:07.311 --> 01:26:08.830
- Oh, Jesus.

1049
01:26:12.109 --> 01:26:13.558
You okay?

1050
01:26:19.703 --> 01:26:21.290
Sorry about what I said,

1051
01:26:22.222 --> 01:26:23.741
you know, about you being weak.

1052
01:26:23.776 --> 01:26:25.432
- Yeah.

1053
01:26:25.467 --> 01:26:27.193
Well,

1054
01:26:28.643 --> 01:26:29.574
that business about
you being a has been,


1055
01:26:32.163 --> 01:26:33.199
I may have been premature
in that regard.


1056
01:26:35.684 --> 01:26:38.618
- Premature in that regard
is right, your lordship.


1057
01:26:43.554 --> 01:26:44.659
Simon?

1058
01:26:44.693 --> 01:26:46.177
Simon!

1059
01:26:46.626 --> 01:26:47.938
Simon!

1060
01:26:47.972 --> 01:26:49.940
Hey, hey, stay with me, man.

1061
01:26:49.974 --> 01:26:51.148
Simon?

1062
01:27:01.365 --> 01:27:03.263
- Tell them to take
down Simon Eildon!


1063
01:27:03.298 --> 01:27:04.609
- You can't.

1064
01:27:04.644 --> 01:27:05.576
- Sir, we can't.

1065
01:27:06.991 --> 01:27:08.337
There's a live stream
being broadcast to the web.


1066
01:27:16.345 --> 01:27:17.208
Sources at the heart

1067
01:27:17.243 --> 01:27:18.934
of the Scottish
government are reporting


1068
01:27:18.969 --> 01:27:20.902
that the young man involved
in what's now become known


1069
01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:22.904
as the Edinburgh Incident

1070
01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:26.286
may well have survived his
encounter with a serial killer.


1071
01:27:26.321 --> 01:27:28.081
The online video clip
that was published


1072
01:27:28.116 --> 01:27:30.601
by an as yet unknown source

1073
01:27:30.635 --> 01:27:33.742
continues to be the number
one trending clip worldwide


1074
01:27:33.777 --> 01:27:35.779
with specialists and
amateur enthusiasts


1075
01:27:35.813 --> 01:27:38.505
still pouring over it to
decide whether this was


1076
01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:41.888
a genuine psychic event
or just a terrific hoax.


1077
01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:44.373
In other news, the first
minister has announced


1078
01:27:44.408 --> 01:27:47.756
an inquiry into an incident
at the Faslane Nav--


1079
01:27:47.791 --> 01:27:50.034
- You've been asked to attend
various talks in the US,


1080
01:27:50.069 --> 01:27:52.519
specifically Harvard,
MIT and NASA.


1081
01:27:54.798 --> 01:27:56.316
Also, a personal request
for a meeting at Number 10.


1082
01:28:01.425 --> 01:28:03.427
Professor Richet has set up
multi-disciplinary congress


1083
01:28:03.461 --> 01:28:06.016
of scientists in Grenoble

1084
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:08.639
but you have to promise not to
take over any of their minds.


1085
01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:13.471
My former bosses have
extended a cordiale invitation


1086
01:28:13.506 --> 01:28:15.991
for you to consider
serving your country


1087
01:28:16.026 --> 01:28:18.545
and the Japanese corporation
have raised their offer


1088
01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:20.616
to the research foundation.

1089
01:28:20.651 --> 01:28:22.170
But I think they'll
go higher yet.


1090
01:28:24.206 --> 01:28:25.760
- Bloody chancer.

1091
01:28:27.244 --> 01:28:29.487
- Sally excited about
being a big sister?


1092
01:28:29.522 --> 01:28:31.248
- I haven't told her yet.

1093
01:28:31.282 --> 01:28:32.525
- Do you know what
you're having?


1094
01:28:32.559 --> 01:28:35.631
- No, and if you know,
keep it to yourself, okay?


1095
01:28:35.666 --> 01:28:36.840
- Yeah, I won't tell
you what they are.


1096
01:28:36.874 --> 01:28:38.151
- Good.

1097
01:28:38.186 --> 01:28:39.704
They?

1098
01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.190
- Anyway, pull over.

1099
01:28:42.224 --> 01:28:44.019
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what you doing?


1100
01:28:44.054 --> 01:28:45.814
- I'm meeting someone.

1101
01:28:45.849 --> 01:28:47.609
- Who?
- Who?


1102
01:28:48.092 --> 01:28:49.784
- I'll meet you
back at the office.


1103
01:28:52.165 --> 01:28:53.684
- Hey!

1104
01:28:54.823 --> 01:28:56.376
You be okay?

1105
01:28:56.411 --> 01:28:57.170
- I'm sure I'll be fine.

1106
01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:08.526
- Good on you, son.
