00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:22.754
此外，罗斯把我带来了

4
00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:24.713
她带着狗在外面等着
She's waiting outside with the dog.


5
00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:27.846
嘿  你有没有在时速50英里的时候把头伸出车窗外
Hey, you ever stick your head out of a car window doing 50?

她又来了
She's here again.


11

她在看着我

12
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.255
赶紧去你床上睡觉
Try and get back to sleep


13
00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.126
伯金医生要是看见你在我床上就糟了
before Dr. Birkin finds you in my bed.


14
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.693
我看见她了

你什么都没看到
You didn't see anything.

你什么都没看到

闭上眼睛

19
00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.589
你是什么，变态吗
What are you, a pervert?


20
00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:43.939
我结婚45年了

21
00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:46.158
我连我丈夫珍藏的名画都没见过
I never even saw my husband's Gauguins.


22
00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:25.562
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?


23
00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:40.882
丽莎·特雷弗？

24
00:05:42.927 --> 00:05:44.494
你住在这里吗？

你住在哪里？

你下床干什么，小姑娘
What are you doing out of bed, little girl?


29
00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:44.772
嗯?
Well?


30
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.038
自从父母去世后，她有时会梦游
She sleepwalks sometimes since our parents died.


31
00:06:57.567 --> 00:06:59.003
哦

00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:02.267
那么

33

34
00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:07.621
等等
Wait.


35
00:07:07.664 --> 00:07:09.492
雷德菲尔德，是吗？
Redfield, isn't it?


36
00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:11.450
克里斯和克莱尔    雷德菲尔德？

37
00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.543
你这么照顾你妹妹，真是个好孩子

晚安
Good night.


40
00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:43.804
那一定是个静静的梦
That must have been quite some dream.


41
00:08:48.722 --> 00:08:52.160
我差点就被吓屎了
I almost shit my goddamn pants.


42
00:08:52.203 --> 00:08:54.118
如果我知道你会在做梦时尖叫
If I knew you were gonna be screaming in your sleep,


43
00:08:54.162 --> 00:08:55.816
我会把你丢在路边的
I would've left you at the side of the road.


44
00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:01.100
1998年9月30日

45
00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:03.258
你搭便车出门干什么？
What are you doing out hitchhiking


46
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:05.477
而且还是这样的夜晚？
on a night like this anyway?


47
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:06.957
哦 耶
Oh, yeah.


48
00:09:07.001 --> 00:09:08.742
去看你哥哥，你说的
Going to see your brother, you said.


49
00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:10.047
对
Right.


50
00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:12.049
你说以前住在这里
Used to live here, you said.


51
00:09:13.224 --> 00:09:16.184
浣熊市
Raccoon City.


52
00:09:16.227 --> 00:09:18.360
你比我好
Better you than me.


53
00:09:18.403 --> 00:09:19.796
你知道的，回到那个鬼地方
You know, one might have nightmares


54
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.363
可能会让你噩梦连连
heading back into that shithole town.


55
00:09:21.406 --> 00:09:23.060
自从保护伞离开后，
Nothing left 'cept the raccoons


56
00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.453
除了浣熊什么都没留下
since Umbrella started to leave.


57
00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:26.063
你介意吗
Do you mind?


58
00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.717
他们应该告诉你哥哥
They should tell your brother,


59
00:09:27.761 --> 00:09:29.240
“赶紧离开那里”
"Just get out of there."


60
00:09:30.677 --> 00:09:32.504
“收拾东西走人吧“
"Just pack up and leave."


61
00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:34.071
不过，你要把房子卖给谁
Although, who you gonna sell your house to?


62
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.159
没有谁  那是谁
Nobody. That's who.


63
00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:38.597
住在浣熊市
Live in Raccoon?


64
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:41.992
不,谢谢 不可能
No, thanks. No way.


65
00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:44.778
也许你想一直坐到加特林
Maybe you want to stay on till Gatlin,


66
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.128
告诉他你改变了主意
tell him you had a change of heart.


67
00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:49.826
不管怎么说，人们太重视家庭了
People put too much emphasis on family anyway.


68
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.306
有时候你就得放手
Sometimes you just got to let it go.


69
00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:52.524
小心
Watch out!


70
00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:56.615
糟了
Shit!


71
00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.389

72
00:10:33.043 --> 00:10:35.742
哦   不不不不不不
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!


73
00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:37.308

00:10:37.352 --> 00:10:39.746
我没--我都没看见她   她不知从哪冒出来
I di-- I didn't see her. She came out of nowhere.


75
00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:41.704
她半夜在外面干什么？
What's she doing out here in the middle of the night?


76
00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:43.575
我们得找点东西把尸体包起来
We need something to wrap the body in.


77
00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:45.795
你也看到了，对吧?  这不是我的错
You saw it, right? It wasn't my fault.


78
00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:47.928
天哪   我 操

79
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:49.364
操   听我说

80
00:10:49.407 --> 00:10:50.844
我们得找点东西把尸体包起来
We need something to wrap the body in,


81
00:10:50.887 --> 00:10:52.367
然后把它带到城里去
and then we're gonna take it into town.


82
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.847
这不是我的错
It wasn't my fault!


83
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.892
哦  天哪   我操
Oh, Jesus! Fuck!


84
00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:02.681
我哥哥是警察  他能帮助我们
My brother's a cop. He can help us.


85
00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:04.074
警察
Cop?


86
00:11:04.118 --> 00:11:06.294
但这不是我的错    不是我的错
But it's not my fault. It's not my fault!


87
00:11:06.337 --> 00:11:07.774
我知道   我知道
I know. I know.


88
00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:09.819
我操 我操
Fuck! Fuck!


89
00:11:12.648 --> 00:11:14.476
我们不能把她留在这里，明白吗
We can't just leave her here, okay?


90
00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.869
我操

91
00:11:15.912 --> 00:11:18.306
我操  我操  我操  我操
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!


92
00:11:26.662 --> 00:11:28.969
她去哪了？
Where the fuck did she go?


93
00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:34.801
哈喽
Hello?


94
00:11:34.844 --> 00:11:36.237

我们得跟着她

98
00:11:46.203 --> 00:11:48.031
你他妈的想干什么就干什么去吧
You can do whatever the fuck you want.


99
00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:50.251
我他妈的要离开这里
I'm getting the fuck out of here.


100
00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:16.842
生化危机

101
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:33.870
浣熊市，这里曾经是 世界上最大的制药公司"保护伞公司"的总部，现在却成了一座鬼城。保护伞公司正在搬迁到一个新的地方。剩下的只有最后几名骨干员工...还有那些太穷而无法离开的人

102
00:13:10.461 --> 00:13:12.463
我操

103
00:13:26.086 --> 00:13:27.957

嘿，你为什么不坐下来呢
Hey, why don't you just take a seat


105
00:13:39.926 --> 00:13:41.753
让那可怜的孩子一个人呆着吧，威斯克？
and leave the poor kid alone, huh, Wesker?


106
00:13:52.677 --> 00:13:53.635
OK

107
00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.595
十块钱
Ten bucks.


108
00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:00.120
我赌十块钱，你射不中那个
Ten bucks says you can't shoot that off from here.


109
00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.343
这很简单
That's easy.


110
00:14:08.302 --> 00:14:09.956
你疯了吗
Jesus fucking Christ.


111
00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:14.395
用这个，瓦伦蒂安

我操，这是啥？

113
00:14:20.575 --> 00:14:24.144
20块，我连看都不用看 就可以打掉瓶子

114
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:28.931
我是说，当然，你的钱我赢定了

116
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.466

两杯咖啡 外带
Two coffees to go.


128
00:15:27.424 --> 00:15:29.383
漫长的一天
Long day?


129
00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:32.647
-嗨,我可以…        -哦，你一定是…

130
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.344
那个菜鸟
the rookie.


131
00:15:37.434 --> 00:15:39.001
怎么样，菜鸟？
How you doing, rookie?


132
00:15:40.872 --> 00:15:43.136
那个   我听说
So, I heard


133
00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:45.834
你在训练时射中了你搭档的屁股
that you shot your partner in the ass during training.


134
00:15:45.877 --> 00:15:46.835

还有你的，呃，
And that your, uh,


136

爸爸，警队的某个大人物，

137
00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:54.799
不得不把你保释出来
that he had to bail you out.


138
00:15:54.843 --> 00:15:57.846
这就是为什么他们把你调到这个
Now, is that why they transferred you to this...


139
00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:00.457
狗屎小镇？
shithole town?


140
00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:04.635
对      里昂S 肯尼迪
Yeah.Leon S. Kennedy.


141
00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:06.724
“S”代表什么?“愚蠢”吗
What's the "S" stand for? "Stupid"?


142
00:16:08.596 --> 00:16:10.946
别这样，我们只是在逗你玩，小子
Come on, we're just playing with you, kiddo.


143
00:16:12.687 --> 00:16:15.124
你们都在墓地工作吗？
Y'all working the graveyard?


144
00:16:15.168 --> 00:16:17.126
是的  你们要去哪里？
Yep. Where you guys headed?


145
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.476
嗯，有人发现了一具尸体
Well, someone found a body


146
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.000
在斯宾塞旧宅邸——都被咬烂了
up at the old Spencer Mansion-- it's all chewed up.


147
00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:24.133
我以为那儿已经没有东西了
Didn't think there was anything up there anymore.


148
00:16:24.177 --> 00:16:26.744
就我而言他们越早关闭整个镇子越好
Well, the sooner they shut this whole town down, the better,as far as I'm concerned


149
00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:28.616
嘿,嘿
Hey, hey.


150
00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:30.487
你们说的是我的家乡
It's my hometown you're talking about.


151
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:31.706
好吧，欢迎光临
Well, you're welcome to it.


152
00:16:33.099 --> 00:16:34.970
嘿, 来吧    我们得赶快行动了
Hey, come on. We got to shake a leg.


153
00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:41.542
还有  别开枪
And don't shoot.


154
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:42.673
我投降
I'm unarmed.


155
00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:47.722
操  这家伙
Fuck that guy.


156
00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:50.246
好了  那么   呃
Right, so, uh...


157
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.074
我想我得给钱了？
I guess I'm paying?


158
00:16:53.423 --> 00:16:55.599
快点，我们该去警局了
Come on, we should get to the station.


159
00:17:00.735 --> 00:17:02.737
嘿    不要在意我们
Hey. Pay us no mind.


160
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.741
一旦你了解我们，你就会发现我们是好人
We're, uh, nice people once you get to know us.


161
00:17:08.482 --> 00:17:10.266
我是吉尔·瓦伦蒂安
I'm Jill Valentine.


162
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.703
里昂    肯尼迪
Leon... Kennedy.


163
00:17:12.747 --> 00:17:15.793
很高兴认识你  里昂肯尼迪
Nice to meet you, Leon Kennedy.


164
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.321
你没机会的
I wouldn't go there.


165
00:17:21.364 --> 00:17:23.192
她眼里只有那个大块头
She's only got eyes for the big fella,


166
00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:25.542
我不认为你能打败他
and I don't fancy your chances against him.


167
00:17:28.197 --> 00:17:30.460
你真的射中了自己的搭档吗？
You really shoot your own partner?


168
00:17:30.504 --> 00:17:31.766
是 是的
Y-Yeah.


169
00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:33.985
嗯，说来话长
Um, it's a long story.


170
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:35.204
你
You...


171
00:17:36.684 --> 00:17:38.207
你的眼睛怎么了
What's going on with your eye?


172
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:44.735
哦
Oh.


173
00:17:44.779 --> 00:17:47.390
我不知道，过去几周它一直这样
I don't know, it's been doing that the last couple of weeks.


174
00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:49.479
你难道不想去看下医生吗？
You don't think you should see someone about that?


175
00:17:49.523 --> 00:17:51.177
不
Yeah.


176
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.874
没什么大不了的
It's probably nothing.


177
00:18:47.102 --> 00:18:51.672
嘿，那个，呃   那个女人
Hey, that, uh... that woman...


178
00:18:51.715 --> 00:18:55.197
可能并不像看上去那么糟糕，对吧？
That probably just wasn't as bad as it seemed, right?


179
00:18:55.241 --> 00:18:57.025
是的 当然
Yeah. Sure.


180
00:18:57.068 --> 00:18:58.244
谢谢你让我搭车
Thanks for the ride.


181
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.737
欢迎回家
Welcome home.


182
00:19:21.832 --> 00:19:23.921
你怎么了？
What's going on with you?


183
00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:27.925
别对我发火，你这狗娘养的
Don't go getting ill on me, you son of a bitch.


184
00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:29.449
我没有给你买保险
I don't have insurance for you.


185
00:19:30.493 --> 00:19:32.800
啊!   我操
Aah! Fuck!


186
00:19:32.843 --> 00:19:35.977
你他妈的敢咬我，你这个狗娘养的！
You fucking bit me, you motherfucker!


187
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.718
我操
Fuck!


188
00:21:54.681 --> 00:21:57.335
看来  你还在想念吉尔
Still pining after Jill, I see.


189
00:21:57.379 --> 00:21:59.163
不可能的，兄弟
Never gonna happen, bro.


190
00:22:36.853 --> 00:22:39.465
他对我就像父亲一样
He's been like a father to me.


191
00:22:39.508 --> 00:22:41.597
我看见你在给胸部打蜡
I see you wax your chest now.


192
00:22:42.685 --> 00:22:44.208
别笑
Funny.


193
00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:47.385
自从你逃跑后
After you ran away,


194
00:22:47.429 --> 00:22:49.605
威廉就是我最亲的人了
William was the closest thing I had to family.


195
00:22:54.654 --> 00:22:55.959
你怎么进来的
How'd you get in?


196
00:22:57.178 --> 00:22:58.527
撬了你的锁
Picked your lock.


197
00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:00.398
你知道我是个警察吧？
You realize I'm a cop, right?


198
00:23:00.442 --> 00:23:02.139
你的安全措施得改进一下
You need better security.


199
00:23:02.183 --> 00:23:04.402
这是一个普通的锁，克莱尔
It's a single-cylinder dead bolt, Claire.


200
00:23:04.446 --> 00:23:05.708
多数人都会先敲门的
Most people knock.


201
00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:06.840
是的, 我敲过了
Yeah, I tried.


202
00:23:06.883 --> 00:23:08.058
没人应答
No one answered.


203
00:23:08.102 --> 00:23:09.364
所以你才撬
So you broke in.


204
00:23:09.407 --> 00:23:11.279
你为什么回来？
Why are you back here?


205
00:23:11.322 --> 00:23:14.195
太想念浣熊市了？还特地来找我？
Missed Raccoon City so much you had to come pay me a visit?


206
00:23:14.238 --> 00:23:15.936
是的
Yeah.


207
00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:17.894
我他妈的爱死浣熊市了
I fucking love Raccoon City.


208
00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:20.288
“加油，强盗们”
"Go, you Bandits."


209
00:23:20.331 --> 00:23:22.551
你这混蛋
You're an asshole.


210
00:23:22.595 --> 00:23:24.379
不，你知道吗？
No, you know what?


211
00:23:24.422 --> 00:23:27.687
我欠这个小镇的…我欠柏金医生和保护伞公司的一切
I owe this town... I owe Birkin and Umbrella everything.


212
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.951
他们养育了我，让我进入学校，进大学
They raised me, put me through school, the academy.


213
00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.561
他们在那里等我
They were there for me.


214
00:23:32.605 --> 00:23:33.867
你在哪里？
Where were you?


215
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.869
你都五年没联系过我了
I haven't even heard from you in five years.


216
00:23:35.912 --> 00:23:37.827
很高兴见到你
Nice seeing you.


217
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:39.437
克里斯，等等
Chris, wait.


218
00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:41.439
对不起
I'm sorry.


219
00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:43.006
我现在回来了
I'm back now.


220
00:23:45.835 --> 00:23:48.272
听着     我觉得这个地方
Look... I think there's something


221
00:23:48.316 --> 00:23:50.405
可能就要发生点什么事
seriously wrong with this place.


222
00:23:51.624 --> 00:23:53.626
你是什么意思?   好吧      我
What do you mean?Okay, so I-I was


223
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:55.062
我当时在搭便车，然后…
hitching a ride in a truck, and...


224
00:23:55.105 --> 00:23:57.586
拦路搭车 --   也是违法的
Soliciting a ride-- also illegal.


225
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.022
那逮捕我
Arrest me.


226
00:23:59.066 --> 00:24:01.024
听着，我们撞了个人
Look, we kind of hit this person,


227
00:24:01.068 --> 00:24:03.636
但  但他们就这么站起来，然后就 就直接走了
but-but they just got up and they-they walked away.


228
00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:04.724
你撞了个人   天啊,  克莱尔
You hit someone? Holy shit, Claire.


229
00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:05.725
你报警了吗?
Have you reported it?


230
00:24:05.768 --> 00:24:06.943
我这不正在报警吗
I'm reporting it now.


231
00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:08.379
你难道没在听我说话？
You not listening to me?


232
00:24:08.423 --> 00:24:10.425
他们 他们站起来就 就走了
They-they just got up and-and walked off.


233
00:24:10.468 --> 00:24:12.122
你可能变成了肇事逃逸的一方
You could be party to a hit-and-run.


234
00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:13.559
嘘   听着
Shush. Just...


235
00:24:13.602 --> 00:24:16.257
不，克莱尔，我没有时间处理这个
No, Claire, I don't have time for this.


236
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.606
不，听着，好吧，我一直
No. Look, okay, so I've been talking


237
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.912
在聊天室和这个家伙聊天
to this guy in a chat room...


238
00:24:18.955 --> 00:24:20.653
聊天室是什么鬼地方？
What the fuck's a chat room?


239
00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:23.612
就是人们在网上聊天的地方
It's a place on the Internet where people chat.


240
00:24:23.656 --> 00:24:25.745
行了   自己看吧
Just... just watch it.


241
00:24:25.788 --> 00:24:28.530
他叫本·贝托鲁奇
His name's Ben Bertolucci.


242
00:24:28.574 --> 00:24:30.967
它在水里，克莱尔
It's in the water, Claire.


243
00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:33.927
它就在该死的在水里
It's in the fucking water.


244
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:37.365
嗯  整个镇子都被毒害了
Um, this whole town's been poisoned.


245
00:24:38.627 --> 00:24:40.629
慢慢地，年复一年
Slowly, over years and years,


246
00:24:40.673 --> 00:24:43.719
然后  呃   人们开始生病
and, uh, people are getting sick.


247
00:24:43.763 --> 00:24:45.939
哦  拜托    克莱尔
Oh, come on, Claire.


248
00:24:45.982 --> 00:24:47.767
又来了  嘘
Not again.Shh!


249
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.507
你  嘘        瞧  呃
You "shh."See, uh,


250
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:53.381
保护伞公司认为他们可以  呃
Umbrella just thought that they could, uh,


251
00:24:53.424 --> 00:24:57.646
收拾行李走人     任由城镇腐烂
pack up shop and let this town rot away


252
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.388
然后离开，重新开始
while they go off and-and start afresh


253
00:25:00.431 --> 00:25:02.912
然后在别的地方摇身一变，然后
somewhere else all shiny and-and new, and...


254
00:25:02.956 --> 00:25:04.479
他们差点儿就这么做了，但   呃
they almost fucking did it, but, uh,


255
00:25:04.522 --> 00:25:06.699
几天前，他们发生了一个小事故
a couple days ago, they had a little incident.


256
00:25:06.742 --> 00:25:10.267
我说的不仅仅是污染水源的废物
And I'm not just talking about waste poisoning the water.


257
00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:13.227
不，我说的是严重的泄露
No, I'm talking about a real bad leak.


258
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.490
就像切尔诺贝利，你懂我的意思吧
Like Chernobyl, if you know what I mean.


259
00:25:15.533 --> 00:25:17.971
然后 呃  他们一直在试图控制这一切
And, uh, they've been trying to contain that shit,


260
00:25:18.014 --> 00:25:19.973
但现在妖怪已经从瓶子里出来了
but the genie is out of the bottle now,


261
00:25:20.016 --> 00:25:22.540
而我… 我觉得它不会再进去了
and I... I don't think it's going back in.


262
00:25:25.979 --> 00:25:28.155
我害怕,   克莱尔  我 …
I'm afraid, Claire. I'm a...


263
00:25:28.198 --> 00:25:31.637
我害怕他们会毁了这个小镇 …
I'm afraid of what they're gonna do to this town...


264
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.595
而且小镇里还有人
and the people in it.


265
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.123
从那以后，我再也没能和他联系上了
I've not been able to make contact with him since.


266
00:25:40.167 --> 00:25:41.342
好
Great.


267
00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:44.606
他疯了，可能还很危险
He's crazy and probably dangerous.


268
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.478
听着，你的阴谋论 在我们小的时候 就不是真的
Look, your conspiracy theories weren't true when we were kids.


269
00:25:47.522 --> 00:25:48.958
现在 他们也不是真的
They're not true now.


270
00:25:49.002 --> 00:25:50.525
好吧?       你到底来这里干什么？
All right? Why are you really here?


271
00:25:50.568 --> 00:25:52.483
你失业了吗?   您需要钱吗?
Did you lose your job? Do you need cash?


272
00:25:52.527 --> 00:25:54.442
你突然出现在这里，闯进我的房子
You show up here, you break into my house.


273
00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:57.706
什么   什么样的人会这样开锁啊？
What-what kind of person can pick a lock like that?


274
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.796
这 这真让人受不了，而且   这是什么鬼？
It-it's kind of impressive, but also, what the fuck?


275
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.494
对不起，我得准备去上班了
I'm sorry, I got to get ready for work.


276
00:26:03.538 --> 00:26:05.148
克里斯

他浑身青一块紫一块的
He was all green and slimy,


283
00:26:32.088 --> 00:26:35.744
他有黄色的大眼睛和牙齿，像这样

是啊，警报器怎么了？
Yeah, what's with the alarm?

That's right, Redfield. I do not know.

They're investigating a report of a body up by the Spencer Mansion.


369
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.091

呃   斯宾塞大厦是什么？

Oswald Spencer was the creator of the Umbrella Corporation,


373

直到那一年他去世...

377
00:32:37.932 --> 00:32:39.281
你说过“大家都到简报室去”
You said, "Everyone into the briefing room,"


378

没叫你，里昂  是其他人
Not you, Leon. Everyone else.


381
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.809
如果有人进来，而前台接待处

382
00:32:45.853 --> 00:32:47.594
没有人怎么办？
no one behind the front desk?


383
00:32:47.637 --> 00:32:49.161
比如一个老太太在找她的猫之类的
An old lady's looking for her cat or something


384
00:32:49.204 --> 00:32:50.423
-是，你说得对     - 耶稣了个基督
-Yeah, you're right.  -Jesus Christ

-Get back there, man.      -You're right. Okay.

And get a haircut, you goddamn hippie.


387
00:32:53.687 --> 00:32:55.036

Geez.


388
00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.516
不是伍德斯托克
It's not Woodstock.


389
00:32:58.126 --> 00:33:00.302
噢，放松点，警长
Aw, take it easy on the rook, Chief.


390
00:33:04.872 --> 00:33:07.353
对 对不起，威斯克    这重要吗？
I-I'm sorry, Wesker. Is that important?


391
00:33:07.396 --> 00:33:09.616
-不  那个    我  我很好        - 新女友吗？
-No, it's-it's... I'm-I'm good.  -A new girlfriend?


392
00:33:09.659 --> 00:33:10.617
哈？
Huh?


393
00:33:12.227 --> 00:33:14.142
也许你可以带她去好莱坞星球吃饭
Maybe you could take her out to eat at Planet Hollywood.


394
00:33:14.186 --> 00:33:15.665
他们在加特林有一个新的

哦，他们有很好吃的沙拉

和小酒
Little wine.


397
00:33:20.366 --> 00:33:22.672
或者干脆把她带回你的公寓
Or maybe just take her back to your apartment,


398
00:33:22.716 --> 00:33:25.197
在百视达租一部电影，舒服地躺在沙发上
rent a movie at Blockbuster, get cozy on the couch,


399
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.851
或者玩《风之旅人》游戏
or put on some Journey.


400
00:33:27.895 --> 00:33:30.637

Steve Perry's voice, what it does to a woman's heart, huh?


401

听起来怎么样？
How's that sound?


403
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.773
听起来我可能要上床了
Sounds like I might be getting laid.


404
00:33:38.123 --> 00:33:40.081
但今晚不会发生了
But it ain't gonna happen tonight,


405
00:33:40.125 --> 00:33:42.736
因为我要你们五分钟后穿好衣服，所有人

406
00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:44.520
准备起飞，因为我想知道
and ready to fly, because I want to know


407
00:33:44.564 --> 00:33:46.000
B队在哪里

408

这他妈是什么东西？
What the fuck is this?


413
00:34:12.832 --> 00:34:17.103
你所需要知道的一切都在这个设备上

414
00:34:20.856 --> 00:34:25.744
浣熊市将在上午6点被摧毁

415
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.437
威斯克，我们走吧

我们要去哪里？
Where are we going?


420
00:34:56.288 --> 00:34:58.551
你为什么不能告诉我     为什么我们要这么急着离开？
Why can't you tell me why we're in such a hurry to leave?


421
00:34:58.594 --> 00:35:00.988
离开           这就是他们想要的
Leaving-- that's what they want.


422
00:35:01.031 --> 00:35:03.382
所以他们可以毁掉我一生的工作

爸爸，小心！
Daddy, watch out!


424

429
00:35:42.943 --> 00:35:44.814
我们要去哪里？嘘

430
00:35:44.858 --> 00:35:46.425
没事的，小女孩
It's okay, little girl.


431
00:35:46.468 --> 00:35:50.733
因为我们给你找了一个新家庭
Because we have found you a new family.


432
00:35:50.777 --> 00:35:52.605
他们就在外面等你

哦，别担心你哥哥

435
00:35:59.133 --> 00:36:01.309
到时候他也会来的
He'll be coming along as well, in due course.


436
00:36:01.353 --> 00:36:03.442
我们永远不会把你们俩分开的
We would never separate the two of you.


437
00:36:03.485 --> 00:36:05.226
我们只要你 跟着我们走
We just need you to come with us,


438
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.837
然后 有人会帮你收拾东西的
and someone will collect all of your belongings.


439
00:36:16.455 --> 00:36:17.891
威廉
William!


440
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.178
凌晨1点

441
00:38:49.434 --> 00:38:50.957
什么鬼
What the fuck?


442
00:38:52.437 --> 00:38:54.830
你可能需要一个灭火器
You might want to get a fire extinguisher.


443
00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:57.267
然后锁上大门   可能还有其他的
And lock the gates. There may be others.


444
00:38:58.704 --> 00:39:01.184
啊？ 其他... 其他的什么？

我们应该...  我们应该呼叫吗？

你要呼叫谁？你就是警察啊

救护车？
An ambulance?


451
00:39:58.415 --> 00:39:59.982
听着，我不是医学专家
Look, I'm no medical expert,


452
00:40:00.026 --> 00:40:03.116
但我觉得那家伙可能没救了

453

此外，我想你已经发现

什么
What?


492
00:45:49.984 --> 00:45:51.638
我们越快找到他们
The faster we find them,


493
00:45:51.681 --> 00:45:53.814
就能越快离开这个鬼地方
the faster we can get the fuck out of here.

这可不好
This is not good.


498
00:46:31.983 --> 00:46:34.072
这里是保护伞公司

浣熊市，已经封锁戒严

该死的子弹
Goddamn bullets.

00:51:10.304 --> 00:51:12.263
我没有枪
Haven't got a gun.


524
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:16.789
你他妈的是谁？
Who the fuck are you?

里昂，把枪放下

531
00:51:49.517 --> 00:51:51.911
我哥哥克里斯·雷德菲尔德在哪里？
Where's my brother, Chris Redfield?


532
00:51:51.954 --> 00:51:53.434
那么 你是克里斯的妹妹，是吗？
So you're Chris's little sister, huh?


533
00:51:53.478 --> 00:51:55.044
我以为你们俩没说过话
I didn't think the two of you spoke.


534
00:51:58.787 --> 00:52:00.572
他在阿尔克雷山上
He's up in the Arklay Mountains

Does someone want to tell me what the fuck is going on here?

我是说，他们怎么了？

很明显，糟透了

539
00:52:19.243 --> 00:52:22.420
浣熊市的所有出口都被保护伞公司封锁了
All the exits out of Raccoon have been blocked by Umbrella.


540
00:52:22.463 --> 00:52:24.378
我们需要更多的弹药和枪支

浣熊市已经无路可走了
There's no way out of Raccoon by road,


544
00:52:32.647 --> 00:52:34.780
但我们也许可以坐直升机
but we might just be able to take a helicopter.


545
00:52:41.049 --> 00:52:42.166
凌晨2：00

546

547
00:53:23.394 --> 00:53:25.309
嗯，我稍后再给你解释

551
00:54:22.496 --> 00:54:24.977

552
00:54:26.761 --> 00:54:28.633
我命令你呆在那里
I need you to stay right there.


553
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:40.122

尽可能压住这里
As much pressure as you can.


558
00:54:54.485 --> 00:54:56.312
去找杜利
Find Dooley.


559
00:54:57.618 --> 00:54:59.185
你会没事的，好吗
You're gonna be okay, all right?


560
00:54:59.228 --> 00:55:01.666
你会没事的   这没什么
You'll be fine. It's just nothing.


561
00:55:27.039 --> 00:55:29.389
坚持住，伙计，好吗
Just hold on, man, all right? It's...


562
00:55:34.133 --> 00:55:36.135
操   不不不不
Shit. No, no, no, no.


563
00:56:06.426 --> 00:56:08.341
杜利

564
00:56:21.223 --> 00:56:23.138
理查德

565
00:56:35.542 --> 00:56:36.935
雷德菲尔德
Redfield!


566
00:56:43.245 --> 00:56:44.943
艾肯
Aiken!


567
00:56:44.986 --> 00:56:46.640
快他妈的离开这里
Let's get the fuck out of here!


568
00:58:28.612 --> 00:58:30.788
你他妈的在干什么，威斯克？等等
The fuck you doing, Wesker?Hold on.


569
00:58:36.707 --> 00:58:38.970
听着   你听到了吗？
Listen. Do you hear that?


570
00:58:53.114 --> 00:58:55.334
维克斯到底在干什么？
What the hell is Vickers doing?


571
00:58:57.118 --> 00:58:59.077
快跑
Run!


572
00:59:23.196 --> 00:59:25.140
凌晨2：29

573
00:59:27.758 --> 00:59:30.848
是的，实际上我从来没有进过这个房间，所以，嗯
Yeah, I've actually never been in this room, so, um...


574
00:59:38.464 --> 00:59:39.900
好东西，对吧？
That's good, right?


575
00:59:39.944 --> 00:59:42.511
我想那只是
I think it's just, uh...


576
00:59:42.555 --> 00:59:45.297
-我觉得有点卡住了     -给我
-Think it's sort of jammed.  -Here. Uh...


577
00:59:47.778 --> 00:59:49.127
穿上这个
Put this on.


578
00:59:50.737 --> 00:59:53.044
那么，你怎么知道这么多关于枪的事？
So, how do you know so much about guns?


579
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:58.310
我八岁时父母死于车祸
My parents died in a car accident when I was eight.


580
00:59:58.353 --> 01:00:01.574
我和哥哥在这里的孤儿院长大
My brother and I grew up in an orphanage here.


581
01:00:01.617 --> 01:00:04.229
我很久以前就逃跑了
I ran away a long time ago.


582
01:00:04.272 --> 01:00:06.318
我必须快点学会保护自己
I had to learn to handle myself quickly.


583
01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:08.407
是啊
Right. Yeah.


584
01:00:10.104 --> 01:00:11.976
你可能想知道像我这样的人当警察
You're probably wondering what a guy like me


585
01:00:12.019 --> 01:00:13.151
是为了什么，对吧
is doing as a cop, right?


586
01:00:14.674 --> 01:00:16.458
有点
Kinda.


587
01:00:16.502 --> 01:00:18.722
是啊 我也是
Yeah. Me, too.


588
01:00:20.724 --> 01:00:23.465
嘿   来人 救我出去！
Hey! Someone get me out of here!


589
01:00:24.902 --> 01:00:26.730
-哈喽     -你是警察 你去
-Hello?  -Your police station.


590
01:00:26.773 --> 01:00:28.688
我看看还能找到什么
I'll see what else I can find.


591
01:00:31.822 --> 01:00:33.388
我在该死的地下室
I'm in the fucking basement.


592
01:00:33.432 --> 01:00:35.390
他们把我关在该死的地下室
They put me in the fucking basement.


593
01:00:35.434 --> 01:00:36.827
把我弄出去
Get me out of here.


594
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:38.350
我知道你在上面
I know you're up there.


595
01:00:38.393 --> 01:00:39.873
哦，感谢上帝
Oh, thank God.


596
01:00:41.353 --> 01:00:43.268
感谢该死的上帝
Thank fucking God.


597
01:00:43.311 --> 01:00:45.183
你得把我弄出去，伙计
You got to get me out of here, man.


598
01:00:45.226 --> 01:00:47.751
你他妈的是谁？
Who the fuck are you?


599
01:00:47.794 --> 01:00:50.579
等你把我弄出去后 我再告诉你 怎么样？
How about I tell you once you get me the fuck out of here?


600
01:01:00.154 --> 01:01:01.808
天哪
Jesus.


601
01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.771
他没事吧
Is he okay?


602
01:01:10.556 --> 01:01:12.471
他
Him?


603
01:01:12.514 --> 01:01:14.647
哦，是的，不，他很好
Oh, yeah, no, he's fucking fine. Yeah.


604
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:17.302
是的   当你生病时  地板上咳点血
Yeah, who doesn't cough up a little blood on the floor


605
01:01:17.345 --> 01:01:18.869
是很正常的
when they're feeling sick?


606
01:01:18.912 --> 01:01:20.609
只是有点冷
Just a little cold.


607
01:01:20.653 --> 01:01:22.002
当然了 他一点不都好了，伙计
Of course he's not fucking okay, man.


608
01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.699
看看他       打开那该死的门
Look at him. Open the goddamn door.


609
01:01:25.136 --> 01:01:27.660
你 你为什么被关起来？
Why-why are you locked up?


610
01:01:27.703 --> 01:01:29.357
为什么
Why?


611
01:01:29.401 --> 01:01:31.098
因为我发现了真相
Because I found out the truth.


612
01:01:32.752 --> 01:01:34.841
真相？ 什么 什么真相？
The truth? What-what truth?


613
01:01:34.885 --> 01:01:37.539
听我说，你这该死的男孩乐队粉丝
Listen to me, you fucking boy band wannabe.


614
01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:39.454
你认为保护伞公司会把所有的时间
You think Umbrella spend all their time


615
01:01:39.498 --> 01:01:42.196
都花在制造阿司匹林和维生素片上吗？
making aspirins and little vitamin tablets?


616
01:01:44.285 --> 01:01:46.244
-不可能的        -耶稣了个基督
-No fucking way.  -Jesus Christ.


617
01:01:47.898 --> 01:01:49.551
-打开那该死的门    - 那是我的枪
-Open the goddamn door.  -That's my gun.


618
01:01:49.595 --> 01:01:50.726
-快点    -你没必要这么做
-Do it.   -You don't have to do this.


619
01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:52.250
当然，没必要
Sure, I don't.


620
01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:54.513
你 和你所有的警察朋友
And you and all your police buddies,


621
01:01:54.556 --> 01:01:56.645
你们不像镇上的其他人一样生病
you're not sick like the rest of the town


622
01:01:56.689 --> 01:01:58.822
只是因为你们有良好的免疫系统 对吧
just 'cause you got a good immune system, right?


623
01:01:58.865 --> 01:02:02.129
妈的，你可能打了一针
Fuck, you probably had a little injection,


624
01:02:02.173 --> 01:02:05.219
一片你都没意识到的维生素片
a little vitamin pill you didn't even realize.


625
01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:08.092
让你们安全至少一段时间
Keeps you safe at least for a while.


626
01:02:08.135 --> 01:02:12.270
但是其他人，那些普通人
But the others, ordinary people,


627
01:02:12.313 --> 01:02:14.663
那些牺牲品
expendable ones...


628
01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:16.752
真他妈的走运，对吧？
Yeah, good fucking luck, right?


629
01:02:16.796 --> 01:02:18.406
打开那该死的门
Open the goddamn door.


630
01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:20.191
钥匙在那边桌子里
The keys are over there in the desk.


631
01:02:20.234 --> 01:02:22.410
快点
Do it!


632
01:02:22.454 --> 01:02:23.759
知道了
Here I go.


633
01:02:23.803 --> 01:02:25.196
耶稣
Jesus...


634
01:02:25.239 --> 01:02:27.285
了个基督
fucking Christ.


635
01:02:28.939 --> 01:02:30.766
快点  伙计  耶稣了个基督
Come on, man. Jesus fucking Christ.


636
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.594
赶快
Hurry up.


637
01:02:32.638 --> 01:02:35.510
哦  我操
Oh, fuck me.


638
01:02:35.554 --> 01:02:39.253
你听说过T病毒和G病毒吗？
Yeah, you ever heard of the T-Virus and the G-Virus?


639
01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.690
当然了，他妈的当然没有听说过
Uh, of course you fucking haven't.


640
01:02:41.734 --> 01:02:45.956
这是一种能改变活细胞DNA基因的病毒
Well, it's a virus that genetically modifies the DNA of a living cell,


641
01:02:45.999 --> 01:02:49.133
它把这些人变成了该死的武器，伙计
and it's turning these people into fucking weapons, man.


642
01:02:49.176 --> 01:02:51.396
你得把我从这里弄出来，好吗
You need to get me the fuck out of here, okay?


643
01:02:53.615 --> 01:02:55.095
这事别太认真
Be an asshole about it.


644
01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:56.705
是的，我已经抓住机会了
Yeah, well, I'm done taking chances.


645
01:03:02.537 --> 01:03:04.409
快点，伙计 耶稣了个基督
Come on, man. Jesus fucking Christ.


646
01:03:04.452 --> 01:03:06.585
好了  你知道什么？ 请等一下
All right. You know what? Just one second, please.


647
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:10.981
你不是爱因斯坦，不是吗，伙计？
You're no Einstein, are you, buddy?


648
01:03:12.286 --> 01:03:13.635
感谢该死的上帝
Thank fucking God.


649
01:04:04.425 --> 01:04:06.166
本
Ben.


650
01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.050
振作起来
Get your shit together,


651
01:04:20.093 --> 01:04:22.269
否则你会熬不过去的
or you're not gonna make it through the night.


652
01:04:43.943 --> 01:04:45.510
你完事了吗？
Are you done?


653
01:04:48.948 --> 01:04:51.342
我真的很想离开这个小镇
I just really want to get out of this town.


654
01:04:52.865 --> 01:04:54.693
维克斯，收到了吗？完毕
Vickers, can you read me? Over.


655
01:04:56.477 --> 01:04:58.044
维克斯，我是铁人队长
Vickers, this is Chief Irons.


656
01:04:58.088 --> 01:05:00.046
拿起你那该死的对讲机
Pick up your damn radio!


657
01:05:01.656 --> 01:05:03.571
维克斯，收到了吗？
Vickers, can you read me?


658
01:05:03.615 --> 01:05:05.051
完毕
Over


659
01:05:05.095 --> 01:05:07.445
维克斯  我是铁人队长   拿起你那该死的对讲机
Vickers, this is Irons. Pick up your damn radio.


660
01:05:33.123 --> 01:05:34.994
你救了我的命
You saved my life.


661
01:05:49.095 --> 01:05:50.879
拜托
Come on.


662
01:05:50.923 --> 01:05:52.403
拜托  拜托
Come on, come on.


663
01:06:05.459 --> 01:06:08.332
天哪  她说的是真的
Holy shit, she was telling the truth.


664
01:06:10.421 --> 01:06:12.031
真的   什么是真的？
Truth about what?


665
01:06:16.035 --> 01:06:17.950
威斯克，怎么了？
Wesker, what's going on?


666
01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:23.912
他们几个月前联系过我
They contacted me several months ago.


667
01:06:26.001 --> 01:06:29.701
曾经有一次，保护伞公司开始将他们的业务移出浣熊市
It was once Umbrella started moving their operations out of Raccoon.


668
01:06:29.744 --> 01:06:31.398
我不知道他们是谁
I don't know who they are.


669
01:06:31.442 --> 01:06:34.140
我不知道，我也不在乎
I don't know, and I don't care.


670
01:06:36.229 --> 01:06:38.536
他们只是一些既得利益者
They're just some people with a vested interest


671
01:06:38.579 --> 01:06:41.278
他们有着大量肮脏的秘密
in getting hold of whatever dirty secrets


672
01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:43.932
保护伞公司把它们存放在在地下 然后就泄露了
Umbrella are keeping down there and exposing them.


673
01:06:45.064 --> 01:06:47.675
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?


674
01:06:47.719 --> 01:06:49.808
拜托，吉尔  别那样看着我
Come on, Jill. Don't look at me like that.


675
01:06:49.851 --> 01:06:51.026
不就是钱吗
It's just money.


676
01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:53.725
好吧   他们还有很多
All right? And they have plenty of it.


677
01:06:53.768 --> 01:07:00.253
这只是逃离小镇死胡同生活的一种方式
It was just a way of getting out of this small-town, dead-end life.


678
01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:03.735
所以
So, uh...


679
01:07:05.432 --> 01:07:07.434
...你打算离开我们
...you were just gonna leave us?


680
01:07:11.699 --> 01:07:14.224
拜托
Come on.


681
01:07:14.267 --> 01:07:17.314
我们得找到克里斯和理查德
We have to find Chris and Richard


682
01:07:17.357 --> 01:07:19.142
告诉他们维克斯死了
and tell them that Vickers is dead.


683
01:07:23.146 --> 01:07:24.669
拜托
Come on.


684

这是我们唯一的出路
