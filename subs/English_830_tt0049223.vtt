1
00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.934
In the final decade
of the 21st century...


2
00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:35.568
...men and women in rocket ships
landed on the moon.


3
00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:40.394
By 2200 A.D., they had reached
the other planets of our solar system.


4
00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:43.568
Almost at once there followed
the discovery of hyperdrive...


5
00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.429
...through which the speed of light
was first attained...


6
00:01:46.602 --> 00:01:48.192
...and later greatly surpassed.

7
00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.631
And so at last mankind
began the conquest...


8
00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.391
...and colonization of deep space.

9
00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:57.796
United Planets Cruiser C-57D...

10
00:01:57.968 --> 00:02:00.127
...now more than a year out
from Earth base...


11
00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:02.699
...on a special mission
to the planetary system...


12
00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.357
...of the great
main-sequence star Altair.


13
00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.265
- When do we get a D.C. Fix, Jerry?
- Half a minute, skipper.


14
00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.232
Ship on course, sir.
We'll reach D.C. Point at 17:01.


15
00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:25.901
That's less than three minutes now.

16
00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:30.732
- All right. Take it away.
- Aye, aye, sir.


17
00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:34.391
Chief, we'll drop below light speed
in about three minutes.


18
00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.558
- Got your breakable gear stowed?
- Aye, sir.


19
00:02:36.736 --> 00:02:38.429
All right. Good.

20
00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:43.028
D.C. Set and punched on, skipper.

21
00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:45.634
All right, attention.
Captain to crew.


22
00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:47.768
All hands squared away to decelerate.

23
00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:51.026
Ship's beeper will as usual
sound 10 times after lights dim.


24
00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:53.532
- Come on, Doc. D.C., Bosun.
- Aye, aye, sir.


25
00:02:53.703 --> 00:02:57.328
D.C. Stations.
On the double.


26
00:02:57.736 --> 00:03:00.099
Wanna bounce through this one?

27
00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:19.266
All right. We're down
to 0.3896 of light speed.


28
00:04:21.868 --> 00:04:24.130
Warm in here, skipper.

29
00:04:24.402 --> 00:04:26.265
Yeah.

30
00:04:29.902 --> 00:04:31.425
Jerry, you...

31
00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:44.826
There's Altair right on the nose, skipper.

32
00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.558
Meanwhile this ship arranges
its own eclipses.


33
00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:12.024
Okay, Jerry,
punch out an orbit on the fourth planet.


34
00:05:12.202 --> 00:05:13.827
Aye, aye, skipper.

35
00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:20.267
Ship in approach, skipper.
Helical vector oriented.


36
00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:22.958
Attention.
Captain to crew, attention.


37
00:05:23.202 --> 00:05:28.100
Our destination, Altair-4,
is now visible on the main view plate.


38
00:05:29.202 --> 00:05:32.929
As you recollect from your briefing
lectures, this is an Earth-type planet.


39
00:05:33.102 --> 00:05:36.125
Twenty years ago
the spacecraft Belerephon landed here...


40
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.595
...with a prospecting party of scientists.
Our mission is to search for survivors.


41
00:05:40.768 --> 00:05:42.700
That is all.

42
00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:02.130
The Lord sure makes
some beautiful worlds.


43
00:06:02.602 --> 00:06:04.965
How do these continents
check with the old charts?


44
00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:08.431
Itâ€™ll tell you better in a little while,
skipper. Time for brakes.


45
00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:10.863
Okay, take it away.

46
00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:15.397
Astrogator to crew.
Stand by to change flux.


47
00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:45.233
Another one of them new worlds.
No beer, no women, no pool parlors.


48
00:06:45.402 --> 00:06:46.765
Nothing.

49
00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:50.527
Nothing to do but throw rocks at cans,
and we gotta bring our own tin cans.


50
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.100
Attention. Captain to crew.
Now, hear this.


51
00:06:53.536 --> 00:06:56.468
We are now entering
the atmosphere of Altair-4.


52
00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:59.193
No survival suits
will be required upon landing.


53
00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:03.766
Oxygen content: 4.7 richer
than Earth standard.


54
00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:06.231
Gravity only 0.897.

55
00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.091
Adjust your equipment accordingly.
That is all.


56
00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:11.928
All hands, check equipment.

57
00:07:23.202 --> 00:07:25.861
Not even any
short-range radio signals yet?


58
00:07:26.035 --> 00:07:28.126
Not so far, sir.

59
00:07:32.402 --> 00:07:34.731
Jerry, can you make out
anything down there?


60
00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:37.598
I may be missing
some individual structures...


61
00:07:37.768 --> 00:07:41.428
...but there are no cities, ports,
roads, bridges, dams.


62
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:44.863
There's just no sign
of civilization at all.


63
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:49.094
Sir, we're being radar-scanned.

64
00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:51.623
- Can you zero on it?
- No, sir...


65
00:07:51.835 --> 00:07:55.029
...but it seems to emanate
from an area of about 20 miles square.


66
00:07:55.202 --> 00:07:57.861
- Twenty miles square?
- Yes, sir.


67
00:07:58.568 --> 00:08:01.091
- Bosun, flash the alert.
- Aye, aye, sir.


68
00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:04.201
Combat stations,
blaster men, activate your scopes.


69
00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:06.267
Radio contact, sir.
There's a voice here.


70
00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:08.402
- Human?
- Yes, sir. Sounds like it.


71
00:08:08.568 --> 00:08:10.262
Boost it.

72
00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:15.424
Spaceship, identify yourself.
You're being tracked.


73
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:17.567
Cut me in, Quinn.

74
00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:22.924
United Planets Cruiser C-57D,
J.J. Adams commanding.


75
00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:27.228
- Who are you?
- Morbius of the Belerephon.


76
00:08:27.402 --> 00:08:30.856
- Who?
- Edward Morbius.


77
00:08:31.835 --> 00:08:34.393
Yeah, here it is.
Morbius, E. Ph.D., Lit. D...


78
00:08:34.568 --> 00:08:37.433
...expedition philologist.
- Philologist?


79
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:40.227
What do you wish here, cruiser?

80
00:08:40.402 --> 00:08:42.924
Well, you don't understand, sir.
We're your relief.


81
00:08:43.102 --> 00:08:46.898
- We're very glad to find you alive.
- I, of course, appreciate your concern.


82
00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:51.024
But absolutely no assistance
of any sort is required.


83
00:08:51.202 --> 00:08:53.963
Oh, the red-carpet treatment, huh?

84
00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:57.965
Dr. Morbius, my orders are to survey
the situation on Altair-4.


85
00:08:58.135 --> 00:09:01.363
Let me repeat.
I'm in no sort of difficulty here.


86
00:09:01.535 --> 00:09:05.968
Your best procedure will be
to turn back at once without landing.


87
00:09:06.135 --> 00:09:08.965
- Sorry, sir?
- Lf you set down on this planet...


88
00:09:09.202 --> 00:09:14.759
...I warn you that I cannot be answerable
for the safety of your ship or your crew.


89
00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:18.627
If you'll just supply me
with landing coordinates.


90
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:23.201
Dr. Morbius,
I require landing coordinates.


91
00:09:23.369 --> 00:09:27.596
Very well, but I wash my hands
of all responsibility.


92
00:09:27.768 --> 00:09:31.530
- You have standard charts?
- Yes, sir.


93
00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:36.896
You may come in at 83- 17-4 North...

94
00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:40.762
...148-21 West.

95
00:09:40.935 --> 00:09:42.594
Thank you.

96
00:09:44.568 --> 00:09:46.557
It's right back there in the desert.

97
00:09:46.735 --> 00:09:49.031
Commander,
I strongly urge you to reconsider.


98
00:09:49.202 --> 00:09:52.100
Please permit me to recommend...

99
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:54.962
Something funny down there, skipper.

100
00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:02.361
- Okay, Jerry, I'll take her in.
- Aye, sir.


101
00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:07.866
Attention. Captain to crew,
stand by to reverse polarity.


102
00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:11.967
Standard class-A security
will be maintained upon landing.


103
00:10:12.135 --> 00:10:14.862
And until further notice,
all hands will wear side arms.


104
00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:16.864
That is all.

105
00:10:17.568 --> 00:10:19.262
- Artificial gravity off.
- Grav off.


106
00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:20.628
- Half flux.
- Half flux.


107
00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:23.892
- Cut primary coils.
- Primaries cut, sir.


108
00:11:29.468 --> 00:11:31.400
All clear, sir.

109
00:11:39.902 --> 00:11:41.458
Look at the color of that sky.

110
00:11:41.935 --> 00:11:44.901
- Yeah, but I'll still take blue.
- I don't know.


111
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:48.398
I think a man could get used to this
and grow to love it.


112
00:11:48.568 --> 00:11:49.625
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.


113
00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:51.630
- You can assemble a tractor.
- Aye, sir.


114
00:11:51.835 --> 00:11:53.858
Better check
the command mike, skipper.


115
00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:57.467
- The command mike, sir.
- Oh, yeah. Good idea. Chief.


116
00:11:57.635 --> 00:11:59.295
- Sir?
- You're in command now, Quinn.


117
00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:01.957
- You keep right at those instruments.
- Aye, aye, sir.


118
00:12:02.135 --> 00:12:04.033
Hey, what's this dust coming?

119
00:12:18.968 --> 00:12:20.456
Looks like we're being met.

120
00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:22.265
- Bosun.
- Aye, aye, sir.


121
00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:25.061
- Hold the tractor.
- Aye, aye, sir.


122
00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:30.697
- Quite a vehicle, huh?
- That driver must be a madman.


123
00:12:31.902 --> 00:12:33.868
What driver?

124
00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:07.924
Welcome to Altair-4, gentlemen.

125
00:13:08.102 --> 00:13:11.864
I am to transport you
to the residence.


126
00:13:13.468 --> 00:13:16.434
If you do not speak English...

127
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:19.726
...I am at your disposal
with 187 other languages...


128
00:13:19.902 --> 00:13:23.265
...along with their various dialects
and sub-tongues.


129
00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:26.765
Colloquial English will do fine,
thank you.


130
00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:32.423
This is no offense,
but you are a robot, aren't you?


131
00:13:32.601 --> 00:13:34.294
That is correct, sir.

132
00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:39.366
For your convenience, I am monitored
to respond to the name "Robby."


133
00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:42.533
Nice climate you have here.

134
00:13:42.702 --> 00:13:45.191
High oxygen content.

135
00:13:45.368 --> 00:13:49.528
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.


136
00:13:50.435 --> 00:13:54.265
Hey, Doc, is it a...?
Is it a male or a female?


137
00:13:56.468 --> 00:14:00.901
In my case, sir, the question
is totally without meaning.


138
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:03.626
Will you get in, gentlemen.

139
00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:13.461
Quinn.

140
00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:15.725
Track this if I blink red.

141
00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:18.629
- I'll bring the tractor in a hurry, sir.
- Right.


142
00:14:37.735 --> 00:14:41.827
Passengers will please
fasten their seat belts.


143
00:14:46.102 --> 00:14:47.761
Looks after us like a mother.

144
00:15:07.902 --> 00:15:11.857
If you gentlemen will go in,
you're expected.


145
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:27.091
- I am Morbius.
- I'm Commander Adams.


146
00:15:27.268 --> 00:15:29.632
This is Lieutenant Farman,
my executive...


147
00:15:29.835 --> 00:15:32.063
...and Lieutenant Ostrow,
our ship's doctor.


148
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.397
How ironic that a simple scholar
with no ambition...


149
00:15:39.568 --> 00:15:42.898
...beyond a modest measure
of seclusion should, out of a clear sky...


150
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:46.626
...find himself besieged by an army
of fellow creatures...


151
00:15:46.835 --> 00:15:49.426
...all grimly determined
to be of service to him.


152
00:15:49.601 --> 00:15:54.034
I'm sorry, sir, if we're not welcome,
but we do have our orders.


153
00:15:54.234 --> 00:15:56.097
You must stay for lunch,
gentlemen.


154
00:15:56.268 --> 00:16:01.428
And do forgive the ill manners
of an old recluse. Won't you come in.


155
00:16:11.902 --> 00:16:15.095
Whatever that lunch was,
it was certainly delicious.


156
00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:17.598
Simply some of Robby's synthetics.

157
00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:22.200
- He's your cook too?
- Even manufactures the raw materials.


158
00:16:22.368 --> 00:16:24.391
Come round here, Robby.

159
00:16:24.568 --> 00:16:28.125
I'll show you how this works.

160
00:16:30.968 --> 00:16:35.127
One introduces a sample of human food
through this aperture.


161
00:16:35.334 --> 00:16:38.960
Down here there's a small built-in
chemical laboratory where he analyzes it.


162
00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:42.965
Later he can reproduce identical
molecules in... In any shape or quantity.


163
00:16:43.134 --> 00:16:45.327
Why, it's a housewife's dream.

164
00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:48.365
Plus absolute, selfless obedience.

165
00:16:48.535 --> 00:16:51.399
Activate the disposal unit.

166
00:17:01.968 --> 00:17:04.195
A household disintegrator beam.

167
00:17:04.968 --> 00:17:07.126
Put your arm in there.

168
00:17:09.902 --> 00:17:11.891
Order canceled.

169
00:17:12.468 --> 00:17:14.593
Don't attribute feelings to him,
gentlemen.


170
00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:17.734
Robby is simply a tool.
Tremendously strong, of course.


171
00:17:17.902 --> 00:17:21.334
He could quite easily topple
this house off its foundation.


172
00:17:21.535 --> 00:17:24.899
Well, in the wrong hands, mightn't
such a tool become a deadly weapon?


173
00:17:25.268 --> 00:17:29.064
No, doctor, not even though I were
the mad scientist of the tape thrillers...


174
00:17:29.234 --> 00:17:32.394
...because, you see, there happens
to be a built-in safety factor.


175
00:17:32.835 --> 00:17:37.267
Commander, may I borrow that
formidable-looking side arm of yours?


176
00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:43.761
Thank you.

177
00:17:43.935 --> 00:17:49.390
Robby, point this thing at that
Althaea frutex out there on the terrace.


178
00:17:50.902 --> 00:17:52.561
Fire.

179
00:17:57.401 --> 00:18:01.060
- Do you understand the mechanism?
- Yes, Morbius.


180
00:18:01.234 --> 00:18:03.894
A simple blaster.

181
00:18:04.068 --> 00:18:07.762
All right.
Now, turn around here.


182
00:18:09.034 --> 00:18:10.898
Point it at the commander.

183
00:18:17.702 --> 00:18:20.259
Aim right between the eyes.

184
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.094
Fire.

185
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:34.629
You see, he's helpless.

186
00:18:34.835 --> 00:18:37.801
Locked in a sub-electronic dilemma
between my direct orders...


187
00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:41.263
...and his basic inhibitions
against harming rational beings.


188
00:18:41.435 --> 00:18:43.025
Cancel.

189
00:18:44.034 --> 00:18:46.466
If I were to allow that to continue...

190
00:18:46.635 --> 00:18:49.760
...he would blow every circuit
in his body.


191
00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:54.767
Doctor, how did you come by
such a mechanism?


192
00:18:56.334 --> 00:19:00.767
I didn't come by him, doctor,
I tinkered him together...


193
00:19:00.934 --> 00:19:04.765
...during my first months up here.
- Coffee is ready, sir.


194
00:19:04.934 --> 00:19:06.560
Gentlemen.

195
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:11.425
- Doctor, do you mean that you made this...?
- Gentlemen.


196
00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:14.066
A useful enough toy, lieutenant...

197
00:19:14.234 --> 00:19:18.758
...but nowadays, I have no time
for such things.


198
00:19:19.568 --> 00:19:20.556
Dr. Morbius...

199
00:19:20.835 --> 00:19:22.061
...you're a philologist...

200
00:19:22.234 --> 00:19:25.758
...an expert in words and languages,
their origins and meanings.


201
00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:28.923
Yet this robot of yours
is beyond the combined resources...


202
00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:31.896
...of all Earth's physical science.

203
00:19:32.068 --> 00:19:37.797
My dear commander, maybe you
overestimate both Robby and myself.


204
00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:42.457
Gentlemen, let me show you
another bit of parlor magic.


205
00:19:50.068 --> 00:19:52.762
Forgive me, I didn't mean
to alarm you, gentlemen.


206
00:19:52.934 --> 00:19:56.230
I had Robby install
the steel shutters before I realized...


207
00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:58.230
...how altogether safe I am here.

208
00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:08.127
Well, gentlemen,
this has been very pleasant.


209
00:20:08.334 --> 00:20:11.391
You've seen how comfortable
I am here, no hardships...


210
00:20:11.568 --> 00:20:14.398
...no special difficulties...

211
00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:17.125
...and no need
at all for military assistance.


212
00:20:17.334 --> 00:20:19.856
Now, I dare say you're impatient
to get back to base.


213
00:20:20.034 --> 00:20:22.864
Yes, sir, the moment we've interviewed
the other members...


214
00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:24.863
...of the Belerephon party.

215
00:20:25.034 --> 00:20:28.626
Others?
But there are no others, commander.


216
00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:32.095
Before the first year was out,
they had all, every man and woman...


217
00:20:32.334 --> 00:20:36.460
...succumbed to a...
To a sort of a planetary force here.


218
00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:40.294
Some dark, terrible,
incomprehensible force.


219
00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:42.229
Only my wife and I were immune.

220
00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.232
And just how do you account
for your immunity, Dr. Morbius?


221
00:20:46.401 --> 00:20:50.458
My wife and I differed from the others
only in our love for this new world.


222
00:20:50.702 --> 00:20:53.861
In our boundless longing
to make a home here...


223
00:20:54.034 --> 00:20:57.592
...far from the scurry and strife
of humankind.


224
00:20:58.535 --> 00:21:02.467
I remember how when the vote
was taken to return to Earth...


225
00:21:02.635 --> 00:21:05.726
...she and I were utterly heartbroken.

226
00:21:06.535 --> 00:21:08.592
How could we have foreseen
the extinction...


227
00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:11.461
...of so many coworkers and friends.

228
00:21:11.635 --> 00:21:15.067
Skipper, there is no record of any wife
in the Belerephon rolls.


229
00:21:15.234 --> 00:21:17.393
Oh, lieutenant,
look under biochemistry.


230
00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:21.557
Julia Marsin. She and I were married
by the skipper on the voyage here.


231
00:21:21.735 --> 00:21:23.428
I have the certificate.

232
00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:28.033
I thought Robby had managed
some very charming feminine touches.


233
00:21:28.201 --> 00:21:30.565
I take it Mrs. Morbius
isn't at home today?


234
00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:34.064
My dear wife died a few months
after the others.


235
00:21:34.234 --> 00:21:37.564
Only in her case
it was of natural causes.


236
00:21:37.734 --> 00:21:39.530
I'm very sorry.

237
00:21:40.068 --> 00:21:44.091
Dr. Morbius, just what were
the symptoms of all those other deaths?


238
00:21:44.268 --> 00:21:48.030
- The unnatural ones, I mean.
- The symptoms were striking.


239
00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:51.860
One by one, in spite of every safeguard,
my coworkers were torn...


240
00:21:52.034 --> 00:21:54.523
...literally limb from limb.
- By what?


241
00:21:54.702 --> 00:21:56.963
By some devilish thing
that never showed itself.


242
00:21:57.134 --> 00:21:58.724
- And the Belerephon?
- Vaporized...


243
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:02.129
...as the three remaining survivors
tried to take her off.


244
00:22:04.468 --> 00:22:07.059
And yet in all these 19 years...

245
00:22:07.234 --> 00:22:11.723
...you personally have never again
been bothered by this planetary force?


246
00:22:13.568 --> 00:22:16.931
Only in nightmares of those times.

247
00:22:17.535 --> 00:22:20.592
And yet, always in my mind,
I seem to feel the creature...


248
00:22:20.767 --> 00:22:24.893
...is lurking somewhere close at hand.
Sly and irresistible.


249
00:22:25.068 --> 00:22:28.523
And only waiting
to be reinvoked for murder.


250
00:22:29.334 --> 00:22:30.425
Father.

251
00:22:34.468 --> 00:22:36.229
Alta.

252
00:22:36.967 --> 00:22:40.899
Alta, I specifically asked you
not to join us for lunch.


253
00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:42.897
But, Father, lunch is over.

254
00:22:43.068 --> 00:22:46.057
I'm sure you never said a word
about not coming in for coffee.


255
00:22:46.234 --> 00:22:47.961
Well, did you or did you?

256
00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:55.232
This is Commander Adams,
Dr. Ostrow and Lieutenant Farman.


257
00:22:55.401 --> 00:22:57.230
- My daughter.
- How do you do?


258
00:22:57.401 --> 00:23:01.265
I've always so terribly wanted to meet
a young man and now three at once.


259
00:23:01.435 --> 00:23:04.026
- That's very kind of you.
- You're lovely, doctor.


260
00:23:06.468 --> 00:23:08.627
Of course, the two end ones
are unbelievable.


261
00:23:10.535 --> 00:23:12.364
Could this end one
get you some coffee?


262
00:23:12.535 --> 00:23:15.592
Oh, I'm quite able to get it.
Thank you.


263
00:23:24.034 --> 00:23:25.523
Thank you.

264
00:23:25.734 --> 00:23:28.757
Of course, you must make allowances
for my daughter, gentlemen.


265
00:23:28.934 --> 00:23:33.196
She's never known
any human being except her father.


266
00:23:33.368 --> 00:23:35.799
I hope you'll make allowances too, sir.

267
00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:40.024
We young men have been shut up
in hyperspace for well over a year now...


268
00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:42.860
...and right from here,
the view looks just like heaven.


269
00:23:43.034 --> 00:23:44.398
Sugar?

270
00:23:44.568 --> 00:23:48.091
But you keep helping me.
After all, you're not Robby.


271
00:23:48.268 --> 00:23:50.961
I wouldn't mind being Robby
in certain ways.


272
00:23:51.134 --> 00:23:54.225
That's only in certain ways, of course.

273
00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:58.594
I can see that was probably very clever,
but I don't seem to understand it.


274
00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:02.427
Well, there's...
There's no rush.


275
00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:09.258
Yes, I suppose one day I shall be obliged
to make the trip to Earth with her...


276
00:24:09.435 --> 00:24:12.764
...for the sake
of her natural development.


277
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:16.067
I should say fairly soon too.

278
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:19.929
Your father wasn't too happy
at first about your meeting us, was he?


279
00:24:20.101 --> 00:24:22.862
Well, naturally not.
You're from Earth.


280
00:24:23.034 --> 00:24:26.296
- Well, what's wrong with Earth?
- How lucky I am, though.


281
00:24:26.468 --> 00:24:29.956
All three of you
are such very fine exceptions.


282
00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:34.128
- Well, you are exceptions, aren't you?
- Oh, sure, sure.


283
00:24:34.334 --> 00:24:38.925
Well, that is, I am anyway.
Old dependable Jerry.


284
00:24:39.468 --> 00:24:44.093
Of course the doc
can be trusted too, in the daytime.


285
00:24:45.268 --> 00:24:47.530
What about the commander?

286
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:50.924
Well, I hate to tell you this, Alta...

287
00:24:51.101 --> 00:24:55.431
...but that man is notorious
throughout seven planetary systems.


288
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.066
Oh, dear.

289
00:24:57.234 --> 00:24:59.359
What does he do?

290
00:24:59.534 --> 00:25:04.831
Well, l... I don't feel free to discuss
the shortcomings of a fellow officer...


291
00:25:06.101 --> 00:25:11.090
...but any girl or woman
who lets him get her alone, anywhere...


292
00:25:17.101 --> 00:25:18.431
Yes.

293
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.465
Yes, I can see it now.
There.


294
00:25:21.634 --> 00:25:25.192
Just then when he looked at me.
Why, his eyes almost had fire in them.


295
00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:29.631
I'm so glad you don't have
any fire in your eyes, lieutenant.


296
00:25:30.401 --> 00:25:32.299
Well, I'm not that harmless.

297
00:25:32.468 --> 00:25:35.592
- Alta.
- Yes, Father.


298
00:25:38.034 --> 00:25:40.795
These gentlemen have expressed
a very kindly concern...


299
00:25:40.967 --> 00:25:43.626
...over the amount of liberty you have.
- Liberty?


300
00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:47.630
I've explained that you have permission
to visit Earth whenever you choose.


301
00:25:47.834 --> 00:25:49.857
Earth? I?

302
00:25:50.034 --> 00:25:53.432
Then my little girl
never feels lonely or confined?


303
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.726
Why, I don't know.
I have you and Robby and all my friends.


304
00:25:57.901 --> 00:25:59.594
Friends?

305
00:26:01.201 --> 00:26:02.564
Yes.

306
00:26:02.734 --> 00:26:05.894
- Perhaps you better call them, my dear.
- All right.


307
00:26:06.068 --> 00:26:07.897
Come, gentlemen.

308
00:26:15.268 --> 00:26:17.733
Felt something go right
through my head.


309
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:20.424
Alta's whistle is above the pitch
of human hearing.


310
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.328
I often feel it myself.

311
00:26:45.368 --> 00:26:47.856
- What's up?
- Look.


312
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:53.723
No, no.
No, no, watch.


313
00:27:02.034 --> 00:27:03.897
He's as tame as a kitten.

314
00:27:04.068 --> 00:27:07.966
Outside of the range of my daughter's
influence, it's still a deadly wild beast.


315
00:27:19.134 --> 00:27:21.861
Just a routine checkup from the ship.

316
00:27:22.134 --> 00:27:24.293
- What, chief?
- Everything okay, commander?


317
00:27:24.467 --> 00:27:27.298
- No problem.
- Would you mind activating the viewer?


318
00:27:27.467 --> 00:27:29.195
Okay.

319
00:27:30.767 --> 00:27:35.325
As you can see, we're under
no restraint whatsoever.


320
00:27:37.268 --> 00:27:38.893
Knock that off, Quinn.

321
00:27:39.068 --> 00:27:43.228
If I can be of any help to you in your
preparations for the homeward voyage...


322
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.196
Thank you, sir,
but unfortunately...


323
00:27:45.367 --> 00:27:47.595
...circumstances may keep us here
for a while.


324
00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:50.460
- Circumstances?
- You see, my orders don't quite seem...


325
00:27:50.634 --> 00:27:53.395
...to cover the Belerephon fatalities. I...

326
00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:56.863
I'm forced now to contact base
for new instructions.


327
00:27:57.034 --> 00:27:59.932
But, commander,
suppose these new instructions...


328
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.231
...require my return to Earth
for questioning.


329
00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.958
Two years or more
away from my work here.


330
00:28:06.134 --> 00:28:10.532
Tell me, just what is involved
in your making contact with Earth base?


331
00:28:10.701 --> 00:28:13.259
Well, fundamentally, it's a question
of crude power.


332
00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:16.628
How to short-circuit the continuum
on a five- or six-parsec level.


333
00:28:16.834 --> 00:28:20.198
Of course, a transmitter of that sort
isn't exactly standard equipment.


334
00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:23.129
To build one, we'd have
to cannibalize about two-thirds...


335
00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:26.891
...of a ship's electronic gear, and then
unship the main drive to juice it.


336
00:28:27.068 --> 00:28:31.125
Just to construct a bunker to house
a core would take about 10 days.


337
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.760
Disabled here for 10 days and nights?

338
00:28:34.934 --> 00:28:38.094
Tell me, would 2-inch
lead shielding do as well?


339
00:28:38.268 --> 00:28:41.392
It'd be better if we were carrying

340
00:28:41.567 --> 00:28:43.362
I'll have Robby run it off for you...

341
00:28:43.534 --> 00:28:46.398
...and you'll get it
not later than tomorrow noon.


342
00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:48.897
That's very obliging of you, sir.

343
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.894
Obliging?

344
00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:53.928
Look out there, commander.
The Belerephon party.


345
00:28:54.101 --> 00:28:57.261
Nineteen years ago I dug those graves
with my own hands.


346
00:28:57.467 --> 00:29:01.957
And I have, believe me, no wish
to repeat that experience.


347
00:29:15.867 --> 00:29:19.095
Well, we'll see you again soon,
Alta, I hope.


348
00:29:19.267 --> 00:29:21.131
- Thank you, doctor.
- Bye.


349
00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:23.027
Excellent lunch, doctor.

350
00:29:23.201 --> 00:29:25.359
To tell the truth,
I sometimes still miss...


351
00:29:25.534 --> 00:29:29.261
...the conversation of such gentlemen
as yourself, doctor.


352
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.964
Well, thank you for your courtesy
and concern, sir.


353
00:29:44.101 --> 00:29:47.226
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.

354
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.730
Easy with this core. Our M.G. Coils
won't take us home without it.


355
00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:18.867
Come on, Cookie, get out of the way.
You wanna get run over?


356
00:30:19.034 --> 00:30:21.864
Handle it gently.
It has to get us home.


357
00:30:24.467 --> 00:30:26.865
Hey, you think it's far enough away
from the ship?


358
00:30:27.034 --> 00:30:28.727
Sure, no interference there.

359
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:31.196
- Well, what about the magnetic puller?
- Bosun...


360
00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:34.765
...just drop the thing down over there.
- Aye, aye, sir.


361
00:30:41.434 --> 00:30:44.730
Where do you wish
the shielding stacked, sir?


362
00:30:44.901 --> 00:30:48.230
Well, you can just put it right over there
by the core, thank you.


363
00:30:48.834 --> 00:30:52.130
Wait a minute.
That's solid lead he's carrying.


364
00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:54.799
Common lead would have crushed
the vehicle, sir.


365
00:30:54.967 --> 00:30:58.922
This is my morning's run
of isotope 217.


366
00:30:59.101 --> 00:31:02.191
The whole thing hardly comes
to 10 tons.


367
00:31:03.367 --> 00:31:05.390
- Hello, Alta.
- Hi.


368
00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:07.362
Does your father know you're here?

369
00:31:07.534 --> 00:31:09.363
He did tell me
not to go near the ship.


370
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:11.057
After all, this isn't very near.

371
00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:17.593
- All right, Cookie, out of here.
- Aye, aye, sir. Yes... Yes, sir.


372
00:31:29.068 --> 00:31:32.932
Commander! Put me down, sir!

373
00:31:33.467 --> 00:31:35.797
- Commander. Commander.
- What is it, chief?


374
00:31:35.967 --> 00:31:37.762
If you'd like to check my assembly...

375
00:31:37.934 --> 00:31:40.559
...for the monitor unit
of the klystron transmitter...


376
00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:42.723
- What, already?
- Yes, sir.


377
00:31:43.467 --> 00:31:45.126
Excellent.

378
00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:53.027
Aren't...? Aren't these condensers
out of my accelerator circuits?


379
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.860
Yes, sir. And I borrowed some solenoids
from your gyrostabilizers too.


380
00:31:57.034 --> 00:32:00.693
But here's the big deal, sir. I'll bet
any quantum mechanic in the service...


381
00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:03.799
...would give his life for a chance
to fool around with this.


382
00:32:03.967 --> 00:32:06.262
Better get this in by dark.
Won't do any good...


383
00:32:06.434 --> 00:32:09.525
...to have some fool fall over it
before we transmit tomorrow.


384
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:11.462
- Good work, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.


385
00:32:17.367 --> 00:32:20.094
Come here.
Over here.


386
00:32:27.767 --> 00:32:29.130
Can I be of service, sir?

387
00:32:29.333 --> 00:32:33.027
Look, never mind the "sir," mister,
but I'm a stranger on this planet.


388
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.894
I was wondering if...
If you could tell me where I could...


389
00:32:36.067 --> 00:32:38.727
A guy could get a hold
of some of the real stuff.


390
00:32:39.067 --> 00:32:42.898
- Real stuff?
- For cooking purposes, you understand.


391
00:32:43.067 --> 00:32:45.966
I take a big pride in my duties.

392
00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:48.827
Pardon me, sir. Stuff?

393
00:32:56.901 --> 00:33:00.856
Just about one jolt left.
Oh, genuine ancient rocket bourbon.


394
00:33:01.034 --> 00:33:04.727
See here. Hey. Gi...

395
00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:09.697
Why, you low-living contraption.
I ought to take a can opener to you.


396
00:33:09.867 --> 00:33:13.526
Quiet, please.
I am analyzing.


397
00:33:16.734 --> 00:33:22.325
Yes, relatively simple alcohol molecules
with traces of fusel oil.


398
00:33:24.067 --> 00:33:27.124
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

399
00:33:27.333 --> 00:33:29.094
Gallons?

400
00:33:29.767 --> 00:33:33.096
I've been from here to there
in this galaxy, and I want you to know...


401
00:33:33.267 --> 00:33:36.427
...you're the most understanding soul
I ever met up with.


402
00:33:41.734 --> 00:33:44.962
It's nothing really personal.
It's just a kiss.


403
00:33:46.033 --> 00:33:48.295
But why should people
wanna kiss each other?


404
00:33:48.467 --> 00:33:50.296
Oh, it's an old custom.

405
00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:52.865
All of the really high civilizations
go in for it.


406
00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:56.124
- But it's so silly.
- But it's good for you, though.


407
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:58.026
It stimulates the whole system.

408
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.223
As a matter of fact, you can't be
in tiptop health without it.


409
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.195
Really?
I didn't know that.


410
00:34:04.367 --> 00:34:06.765
I'd be only too happy to show you.

411
00:34:06.934 --> 00:34:09.399
Well, thank you very much, lieutenant.

412
00:34:09.567 --> 00:34:11.863
No trouble at all.

413
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.862
Is that all there is to it?

414
00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:26.865
Well, you... You've sort of
got to stick with it.


415
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.964
- Just once more. Do you mind?
- Oh, not at all.


416
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.792
There must be something seriously
the matter with me...


417
00:34:49.966 --> 00:34:53.330
...because, honestly, I haven't noticed
the least bit of stimulation.


418
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.362
Honey, let's do this thing right.
Now, here.


419
00:35:12.033 --> 00:35:15.227
Are you giving me the treatment?
Are you?


420
00:35:16.067 --> 00:35:20.022
- Lieutenant Farman.
- Don't say a word, sir. L...


421
00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.724
I know there are a lot of pressing duties
waiting for me back at the ship.


422
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.230
And rank does have
its little privileges, sir.


423
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.922
And you can depend on it that...

424
00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.760
...those privileges won't be stretched
into taking your kind of advantages.


425
00:35:32.933 --> 00:35:35.331
- Oh, but l...
- Dismissed.


426
00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:43.731
What's the matter with him?
Why did he leave?


427
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.333
- Why did you both act so funny?
- Well, what do you expect?


428
00:35:48.233 --> 00:35:50.756
Well, don't you understand, Alta?

429
00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:54.358
No? Well, look at yourself.

430
00:35:54.534 --> 00:35:56.762
You can't run around like that
in front of men.


431
00:35:56.933 --> 00:35:59.456
Particularly not a space wolf
like Farman.


432
00:35:59.634 --> 00:36:03.726
So for Pete's sake go home
and put on something that'll...


433
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.888
Anything.

434
00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:10.928
What's wrong with my clothes?
I designed them myself.


435
00:36:15.267 --> 00:36:17.631
Stop looking at me that way.
I don't think I like it.


436
00:36:18.966 --> 00:36:20.592
What do you mean?

437
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.628
We were just trying to get
a little healthy stimulation...


438
00:36:24.833 --> 00:36:27.095
...from hugging and kissing,
that's all.


439
00:36:27.267 --> 00:36:28.857
Oh, that's all.

440
00:36:29.033 --> 00:36:34.863
It's so easy for you, isn't it?
There's no feelings, no emotions, you...


441
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.723
Nothing human
would ever enter your mind.


442
00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:41.422
Well, it so happens that I'm in command
of 18 competitively selected...


443
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.294
...super-perfect physical specimens
with an average age of 24.6...


444
00:36:46.467 --> 00:36:51.058
...who have been locked up
in hyperspace for 378 days.


445
00:36:51.833 --> 00:36:55.890
It would have served you right
if I hadn't of... And... And he...


446
00:36:56.866 --> 00:37:00.026
Get out of here before I have
you run out of the area under guard.


447
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.893
And then I'll put more guards
on the guards.


448
00:37:13.434 --> 00:37:17.127
"And then I'll put more guards
on the guards."


449
00:37:17.701 --> 00:37:20.860
I don't like him.
I just don't like him.


450
00:37:21.033 --> 00:37:24.124
The way he kept looking at me.
Then he shouted.


451
00:37:24.333 --> 00:37:27.527
- What about?
- I don't know. I don't know, really.


452
00:37:27.701 --> 00:37:29.530
It... It was awful.

453
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:33.258
I was only trying to be nice
about kissing the lieutenant.


454
00:37:35.534 --> 00:37:38.466
- How did the commander react to that?
- Well, he was furious.


455
00:37:38.701 --> 00:37:41.724
He thinks all that about biology
had something to do with me.


456
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.128
Personally, I mean.
Never been so nervous in all my life.


457
00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:49.288
And I hope I don't see him again
if I live to be 400 million.


458
00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.898
Well, I dare say you won't have to.

459
00:37:52.067 --> 00:37:54.260
I think the best thing you can do
is go to bed.


460
00:37:54.434 --> 00:37:57.264
I still have some work to do
in my study.


461
00:37:57.434 --> 00:37:59.956
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.


462
00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:26.729
Where have you been?
I've beamed and beamed.


463
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.697
Sorry, miss,
I was giving myself an oil job.


464
00:38:30.866 --> 00:38:33.798
And what is it you require
this time, Miss Alta?


465
00:38:33.966 --> 00:38:37.864
Robby, I must have a new dress.
Right away.


466
00:38:38.033 --> 00:38:40.556
- Again?
- Oh, but this one must be different.


467
00:38:40.733 --> 00:38:45.257
Absolutely nothing must show,
below, above or through.


468
00:38:45.434 --> 00:38:49.763
- Radiation-proof?
- No, just eye-proof will do.


469
00:38:50.233 --> 00:38:52.631
- Thick and heavy?
- Oh, no. No, Robby.


470
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:56.061
It must be the loveliest, softest thing
you've ever made for me.


471
00:38:56.233 --> 00:39:00.927
And fit in all the right places
with lots and lots of star sapphires.


472
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.430
Star sapphires take a week
to crystallize properly.


473
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.623
- Would diamonds or emeralds do?
- Well, if they're large enough.


474
00:39:09.833 --> 00:39:13.731
Five, 10, and 15 carats,
and on hand.


475
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.730
I will run the dress up for you
in time for breakfast.


476
00:39:20.434 --> 00:39:23.866
- Sleep well, miss.
- Thank you, Robby.


477
00:39:24.033 --> 00:39:27.466
I don't really care now
whether I do or not.


478
00:39:38.267 --> 00:39:41.858
Funny to see two moons
in the sky, isn't it?


479
00:39:42.033 --> 00:39:46.227
- Funny how quick a guy gets used to it.
- Yeah.


480
00:39:50.434 --> 00:39:52.865
- Joe.
- What?


481
00:39:53.033 --> 00:39:56.591
- Do you hear something?
- Like what?


482
00:39:56.766 --> 00:39:59.597
Like a sort of big breathing.

483
00:40:01.133 --> 00:40:02.599
No.

484
00:40:02.766 --> 00:40:06.392
That's funny, I did.

485
00:40:49.633 --> 00:40:52.099
Strong and Grey, last night,
during your watch...


486
00:40:52.267 --> 00:40:56.222
...this ship was entered and valuable
government property was sabotaged.


487
00:40:56.434 --> 00:41:00.025
Now, the two of you claim
to have been at your posts and awake.


488
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.689
Yet the ship was entered, the heavy-duty
hatch was raised and latched back.


489
00:41:04.866 --> 00:41:07.230
And neither of you
saw or heard anything.


490
00:41:07.534 --> 00:41:09.761
Except you, Grey.
You heard breathing.


491
00:41:11.233 --> 00:41:14.687
And Youngerford, let me see,
you were asleep in your bunk...


492
00:41:15.733 --> 00:41:19.631
...and you think you had a dream.

493
00:41:20.267 --> 00:41:23.131
A dream.

494
00:41:24.233 --> 00:41:26.926
Pending evidence, you're deprived
of space pay and privileges.


495
00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:28.895
Oh, me too, sir?

496
00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:31.465
No, "me too, sir," will stand

497
00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:34.464
I'll have less dreaming aboard this ship.

498
00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:37.231
Dismissed.

499
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.763
- Skipper.
- Come on. Well, Quinn?


500
00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:43.126
Half of this gear
we can replace out of stores.


501
00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:45.390
The rest we can patch up
one way or another.


502
00:41:45.566 --> 00:41:48.431
Except this special klystron
frequency modulator.


503
00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:52.396
Now, with every facility of the ship,
I think I might be able to rebuild it.


504
00:41:52.566 --> 00:41:54.725
But frankly, the book says no.

505
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.458
It came packed in liquid boron
in a suspended gravity.


506
00:41:57.633 --> 00:42:00.395
All right, so it's impossible.
How long will it take?


507
00:42:00.566 --> 00:42:03.124
Well, if I don't stop for breakfast...

508
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.964
- All right, get on it, Quinn.
- Thank you, sir.


509
00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.297
- Tractor's ready.
- Thank you.


510
00:42:17.467 --> 00:42:20.262
- A minute, skipper, I'll change uniform.
- Stay as you are.


511
00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:23.558
- I'm leaving you in command here.
- Oh, I see.


512
00:42:23.733 --> 00:42:25.926
Establish a perimeter.
Set up a class-A alert.


513
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.396
- I want them in force by sundown.
- Aye, aye, sir.


514
00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:21.890
Good morning, gentlemen.

515
00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:24.860
We'd like to see Dr. Morbius.

516
00:43:25.033 --> 00:43:27.124
Morbius is in his study, sir.

517
00:43:27.333 --> 00:43:31.231
Never to be disturbed
while that door is closed.


518
00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:34.758
All right, we'll wait.

519
00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:41.922
Is there any other way
out of there?


520
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.089
This is the only door.

521
00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:49.097
In case you require anything,
gentlemen, use the beamer.


522
00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:58.364
How could he have slipped
past two sentries?


523
00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:04.961
Nothing important, skipper.

524
00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:08.690
Doc, you stay right there where you are
and keep your eye on that door.


525
00:44:08.866 --> 00:44:13.457
Okay, skipper, and if Morbius comes out,
we'll call you from right here.


526
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.260
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


527
00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:40.230
Come on in.

528
00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:42.195
Didn't bring my bathing suit.

529
00:44:42.366 --> 00:44:44.594
What's a bathing suit?

530
00:44:44.933 --> 00:44:46.694
Oh, murder.

531
00:44:47.067 --> 00:44:50.464
Never mind. I'm coming out.

532
00:44:51.533 --> 00:44:53.761
Now, Alta, listen, you mustn't...

533
00:44:53.933 --> 00:44:57.387
You just wait right there.
It'll only take me a second to get dry.


534
00:44:57.966 --> 00:45:00.397
Yes. Well, I'll...

535
00:45:00.766 --> 00:45:02.959
I'll just turn my back here.

536
00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:06.099
Well, if that's the way
you feel about it.


537
00:45:07.966 --> 00:45:11.728
Well, don't worry, you're not gonna have
to look at me anymore from now on.


538
00:45:12.399 --> 00:45:14.229
You'll see.

539
00:45:15.332 --> 00:45:18.526
- See what?
- You'll see what.


540
00:45:20.466 --> 00:45:24.398
Now, wait... Now, wait a minute, Alta.
Now, if you're planning on...


541
00:45:24.599 --> 00:45:29.032
I didn't expect to see you today after
the way you spoke to me yesterday.


542
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.632
I'm... I'm very sorry about the way
I spoke to you yesterday, Alta.


543
00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:37.129
L... I was sort of bothered.

544
00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:47.396
All right, you can look now.

545
00:45:54.933 --> 00:45:57.126
Nothing shows through, does it?

546
00:46:00.067 --> 00:46:02.726
I had it made especially for you.

547
00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.923
Oh, I thought
you weren't expecting me today.


548
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:09.089
I wasn't.

549
00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:14.390
I don't know, I guess there's something
about me personally you don't like.


550
00:46:14.933 --> 00:46:16.728
Alta...

551
00:46:18.033 --> 00:46:20.931
...you will always look just beautiful.

552
00:46:22.067 --> 00:46:24.931
Then why don't you kiss me
like everybody else does?


553
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.895
Everybody?

554
00:46:27.332 --> 00:46:30.060
Hasn't your father taught you
anything at all?


555
00:46:30.232 --> 00:46:33.756
Well, he says I'm terribly ignorant,
but I have had poetry...


556
00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:37.387
...mathematics,
logic, physics, geology and bi...


557
00:46:37.566 --> 00:46:39.123
- ology?

558
00:46:39.332 --> 00:46:42.890
Of course, that's... That's mostly
on the theoretical side?


559
00:46:43.067 --> 00:46:45.124
Well, so far.

560
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.358
Well, what's wrong with theory?

561
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.559
This.

562
00:47:26.466 --> 00:47:30.523
- Alta.
- It's all right, he's my friend.


563
00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.895
I'm...
I'm sorry, Alta.


564
00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:51.624
L... I had to do that.

565
00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:54.095
But he didn't recognize me.

566
00:47:54.266 --> 00:47:57.028
He would have killed me. Why?

567
00:47:59.133 --> 00:48:00.758
You really don't know, do you?

568
00:48:00.933 --> 00:48:04.093
No, I don't.

569
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.422
Is he still in there?

570
00:48:19.599 --> 00:48:21.690
Hasn't come out.

571
00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:26.728
Now, wait a minute, skipper.
After all, it is his house.


572
00:48:28.332 --> 00:48:30.195
What's the matter?

573
00:48:31.433 --> 00:48:35.059
Doc, something new has been added.

574
00:48:38.966 --> 00:48:41.557
That's gonna
complicate things a bit.


575
00:48:41.733 --> 00:48:43.528
Yeah.

576
00:48:58.766 --> 00:49:00.595
Not even a window.

577
00:49:00.766 --> 00:49:02.356
The robot lied.

578
00:49:02.533 --> 00:49:04.294
Morbius hasn't been in here.

579
00:49:04.466 --> 00:49:06.694
Doc, he's up to something.

580
00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:08.855
Look at this, skipper.

581
00:49:10.566 --> 00:49:14.191
- Hieroglyphics?
- Maybe.


582
00:49:14.366 --> 00:49:19.526
But it doesn't look like Egyptian,
cuneiform or Chinese.


583
00:49:22.533 --> 00:49:25.055
You'll find the silver
in the dining room...


584
00:49:25.232 --> 00:49:27.494
...and my daughter's jewelry
on her table.


585
00:49:30.463 --> 00:49:36.589
Dr. Morbius, last night our klystron monitor
was sabotaged.


586
00:49:36.764 --> 00:49:39.195
And you suspect me?

587
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.628
Then the time has come
for clarification.


588
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.625
Sit down.

589
00:49:54.463 --> 00:49:56.861
In times long past...

590
00:49:57.030 --> 00:50:00.929
...this planet was the home
of a mighty and noble race of beings...


591
00:50:01.096 --> 00:50:03.585
...which called themselves the Krell.

592
00:50:03.764 --> 00:50:06.457
Ethically, as well as
technologically...


593
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.755
...they were a million years ahead
of humankind...


594
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.555
...for in unlocking the mysteries
of nature...


595
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.525
...they had conquered even
their baser selves.


596
00:50:15.697 --> 00:50:18.857
And when, in the course of eons,
they had abolished sickness...


597
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:21.724
...and insanity and crime
and all injustice...


598
00:50:21.897 --> 00:50:26.625
...they turned, still with high
benevolence, outward toward space.


599
00:50:26.897 --> 00:50:30.590
Long before the dawn of man's history,
they had walked our Earth...


600
00:50:30.764 --> 00:50:33.025
...and brought back
many biological specimens.


601
00:50:33.196 --> 00:50:36.924
I see, that explains
the tiger and the deer.


602
00:50:38.363 --> 00:50:40.522
The heights they had reached.

603
00:50:40.697 --> 00:50:45.129
But then, seemingly on the threshold
of some supreme accomplishment...


604
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:48.558
...which was to have crowned
their entire history...


605
00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:53.355
...this all but divine race
perished in a single night.


606
00:50:54.397 --> 00:50:58.090
In the 2000 centuries
since that unexplained catastrophe...


607
00:50:58.263 --> 00:51:00.786
...even their cloud-piercing towers
of... Of glass...


608
00:51:00.963 --> 00:51:03.054
...and porcelain and adamantine steel...

609
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:07.060
...have crumbled back
into the soil of Altair-4, and nothing...


610
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.253
...absolutely nothing,
remains above ground.


611
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.521
What were they like?

612
00:51:13.063 --> 00:51:16.120
No record of their physical nature
has survived.


613
00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:21.058
Except, perhaps, in the form
of this characteristic arch.


614
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.219
I suggest you consider it
in comparison...


615
00:51:23.397 --> 00:51:27.352
...to one of our
functionally-designed human doorways.


616
00:51:42.897 --> 00:51:45.260
That recording was made
by Krell musicians...


617
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:48.021
...a half a million years ago.

618
00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:50.386
Now, if you will follow me...

619
00:51:50.563 --> 00:51:54.461
...I will show you some of their
other remaining artifacts.


620
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:10.791
Krell metal.

621
00:52:10.963 --> 00:52:13.691
Try your blaster there, commander.

622
00:52:28.263 --> 00:52:29.854
This spot should be molten.

623
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:31.519
It's not even warm, huh?

624
00:52:31.697 --> 00:52:34.026
And no trace of radioactivity.

625
00:52:34.196 --> 00:52:39.128
The molecules are many times more
densely interlocked than in earthly steel.


626
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:42.455
Yet it drinks up energy
like a sponge.


627
00:53:00.463 --> 00:53:03.554
This is just one
of their laboratories.


628
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.423
You will notice that
much of the equipment is familiar...


629
00:53:06.597 --> 00:53:10.085
...though designed
for non-human technicians.


630
00:53:17.363 --> 00:53:19.261
What's this?

631
00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:24.957
On this screen may be projected the total
scientific knowledge of the Krell...


632
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:28.528
...from its primitive beginning
to the day of its annihilation.


633
00:53:28.697 --> 00:53:32.220
A sheer bulk surpassing
many million earthly libraries.


634
00:53:32.397 --> 00:53:36.557
- You're able to read this?
- A little. It's my profession.


635
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:41.128
Twenty years ago I began here
with this page of geometrical theorems.


636
00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:45.285
Eventually, I was able to deduce
most of their huge logical alphabet.


637
00:53:45.463 --> 00:53:46.894
I began to learn.

638
00:53:47.063 --> 00:53:49.723
The first practical result
was that robot of mine...


639
00:53:49.896 --> 00:53:52.419
...which you gentlemen appear
to find so remarkable.


640
00:53:52.597 --> 00:53:54.529
Child's play.

641
00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:56.922
I've come here every day now
for two decades...


642
00:53:57.096 --> 00:54:01.188
...painfully picking up a few of the least
difficult fragments of their knowledge.


643
00:54:01.397 --> 00:54:04.693
A thing like this, it's...
It's too big to evaluate.


644
00:54:04.863 --> 00:54:07.386
- Think what a discovery of this kind...
- Dr. Morbius...


645
00:54:07.563 --> 00:54:09.119
...what is this device over here?

646
00:54:09.363 --> 00:54:12.124
I call it their plastic educator.

647
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:16.853
As far as I can make out, they used it
to condition and test their young...


648
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:21.622
...in much the same way as we employed
finger-painting among our children.


649
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:24.387
I often play with it myself
for relaxation.


650
00:54:24.563 --> 00:54:27.393
Although working here,
I sometimes wish I'd been blessed...


651
00:54:27.563 --> 00:54:30.028
...with multiple arms and legs.

652
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:33.387
Now, you can see that
this headset was designed...


653
00:54:33.563 --> 00:54:37.359
...for something much bulkier
than my human cranium.


654
00:54:41.597 --> 00:54:46.790
Now, over here you see
the electromagnetic waves of my brain...


655
00:54:46.963 --> 00:54:50.555
...sending that indicator up
about halfway.


656
00:54:50.729 --> 00:54:53.889
I gather that
one of their own young...


657
00:54:54.063 --> 00:54:57.188
...comparable to a seven-year-old child,
was normally expected...


658
00:54:57.363 --> 00:54:59.261
...to send that all the way
to the top...


659
00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:02.918
...which by Krell standards
classifies me as a low-grade moron.


660
00:55:03.096 --> 00:55:07.392
Yet I have
an officially recorded IQ of 183.


661
00:55:07.563 --> 00:55:10.756
Now then,
for the primary function.


662
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.689
Actually, to operate...

663
00:55:14.863 --> 00:55:20.762
Well, I'll choose a familiar subject
to start with to save time.


664
00:55:27.063 --> 00:55:29.461
There now, gentlemen.

665
00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:35.124
What's that?

666
00:55:35.397 --> 00:55:37.522
What's happening there?

667
00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:44.187
A statue.

668
00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:50.392
That's Altaira.

669
00:55:50.696 --> 00:55:53.254
Simply a three-dimensional image,
commander.


670
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:54.623
But it's alive.

671
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:59.455
Because my daughter is alive in my brain
from microsecond to microsecond...


672
00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:00.959
...while I manipulate.

673
00:56:02.863 --> 00:56:04.591
There.

674
00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:07.020
Something of a strain.

675
00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:11.296
Aladdin's lamp
in a physics laboratory.


676
00:56:11.463 --> 00:56:14.293
Would you care to take the Krell test
of your intelligence?


677
00:56:14.463 --> 00:56:17.190
- Yes, very much.
- You may be disappointed, commander.


678
00:56:17.363 --> 00:56:20.090
Suppose we start
with the good doctor.


679
00:56:20.263 --> 00:56:23.854
- What do I do?
- Just sit down there, and I'll...


680
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:25.920
Move a little forward. That's it.

681
00:56:26.463 --> 00:56:27.860
There now.

682
00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:30.962
Now, doctor, you can read it here.

683
00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.619
Well, there's something wrong here.

684
00:56:34.096 --> 00:56:37.187
I have an IQ of 161...

685
00:56:37.363 --> 00:56:39.692
...yet I don't register a third
what you did.


686
00:56:40.729 --> 00:56:42.854
Now the commander.

687
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:59.091
It's all right, sir. A commanding officer
doesn't need brains.


688
00:56:59.263 --> 00:57:02.024
- Just a good loud voice, huh?
- How do I make an image?


689
00:57:02.196 --> 00:57:04.185
- Do I just pull this switch?
- Don't. Stop.


690
00:57:04.363 --> 00:57:05.522
You'd never survive.

691
00:57:05.696 --> 00:57:07.787
Our Belerephon skipper tried it...

692
00:57:07.963 --> 00:57:09.952
...and it was instantly fatal to him.

693
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:14.256
Oh, I see.
So you're immune to this too?


694
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:17.055
In my first attempt
at creating an image here...


695
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.627
...my brain pattern there
was scarcely any larger than yours.


696
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:23.920
Afterwards, I lay unconscious
for a day and a night.


697
00:57:24.096 --> 00:57:27.619
And yet you came back
for a second go at it.


698
00:57:27.863 --> 00:57:29.920
It was a question
of science, doctor.


699
00:57:30.096 --> 00:57:33.426
But you can imagine my joy
when I discovered that the shock...


700
00:57:33.596 --> 00:57:38.461
...had permanently... Permanently
doubled my intellectual capacity.


701
00:57:38.629 --> 00:57:42.357
Otherwise, my researches here
would've come to nothing...


702
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.757
...poor as they have been.

703
00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:50.085
Recently, I have turned up
some rather puzzling indications...


704
00:57:50.263 --> 00:57:53.388
...that in those final days
before their annihilation...


705
00:57:53.562 --> 00:57:58.052
...the Krell had been applying their
entire racial energies to a new project.


706
00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:00.423
One which they
actually seemed to hope...


707
00:58:00.596 --> 00:58:03.392
...might somehow free them
once and for all...


708
00:58:03.562 --> 00:58:07.461
...from any dependence
on physical instrumentalities.


709
00:58:07.629 --> 00:58:10.754
- A civilization without instrumentalities?
- Incredible.


710
00:58:10.963 --> 00:58:14.191
Dr. Morbius, everything here is new.

711
00:58:14.363 --> 00:58:17.124
Not a sign of age or wear
on any of it.


712
00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:22.058
Young man, these devices,
self-serviced, self-maintained...


713
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:26.356
...have stood exactly as you see them
for 2000 centuries.


714
00:58:26.529 --> 00:58:28.223
Two thousand centuries.

715
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.419
And during all this time,
what was the power source?


716
00:58:31.596 --> 00:58:33.187
That's a very good question.

717
00:58:33.363 --> 00:58:39.125
May I draw your attention to these
gauges all around here, gentlemen.


718
00:58:39.463 --> 00:58:43.452
Their calibrations appear to indicate
that they are set in decimal series.


719
00:58:43.629 --> 00:58:45.925
Each division recording
exactly 10 times...


720
00:58:46.096 --> 00:58:48.460
...as many amperes
as the one preceding it.


721
00:58:48.629 --> 00:58:52.118
Ten times 10, times 10,
times 10, times 10, times 10...


722
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:56.285
...on and on and on, row after row,
gauge after gauge.


723
00:58:56.463 --> 00:59:00.895
But there is no direct wiring
that I can discover.


724
00:59:01.063 --> 00:59:05.257
However, when I activate this machine,
it registers infinitesimally...


725
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:08.191
...you see, down there
in the lower left-hand corner.


726
00:59:08.363 --> 00:59:10.454
And then...

727
00:59:10.863 --> 00:59:15.387
...when I activate the educator here...

728
00:59:16.096 --> 00:59:18.459
...it registers a little more.

729
00:59:18.629 --> 00:59:21.789
But this much is negligible.

730
00:59:21.963 --> 00:59:25.418
Why, the total potential here
must be nothing less than astronomical.


731
00:59:25.596 --> 00:59:28.188
Nothing less.
The number 10...


732
00:59:28.363 --> 00:59:32.761
...raised almost literally
to the power of infinity.


733
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:37.755
Gentlemen, would you care to see
some more of the Krell wonders?


734
00:59:37.929 --> 00:59:39.861
- Indeed, yes.
- Yes.


735
00:59:40.263 --> 00:59:44.389
If you will step in this shuttle-car.

736
00:59:57.629 --> 01:00:01.755
How often the Krell technicians
have ridden in this little vehicle.


737
01:00:02.729 --> 01:00:04.752
What now, Dr. Morbius?

738
01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:06.758
Prepare your minds
for a new scale...


739
01:00:06.929 --> 01:00:10.225
...of physical scientific values,
gentlemen.


740
01:00:58.629 --> 01:01:01.027
Twenty miles.

741
01:01:01.462 --> 01:01:03.758
Twenty miles.

742
01:01:04.963 --> 01:01:06.724
Listen.

743
01:01:07.896 --> 01:01:10.794
- Circuits opening and closing.
- And they never rest.


744
01:01:10.963 --> 01:01:12.952
This is one of their ventilator shafts.

745
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:14.959
You can feel the warm air rising.

746
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.857
Look down here.

747
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.723
Look down, gentlemen.
Are you afraid?


748
01:01:30.696 --> 01:01:34.389
Seventy-eight hundred levels...

749
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.457
...and 400 other shafts
like this one.


750
01:02:18.863 --> 01:02:20.795
Yes, a single machine.

751
01:02:20.963 --> 01:02:24.690
A cube 20 miles on each side.

752
01:02:24.863 --> 01:02:28.556
For 2000 centuries
it has waited patiently here...


753
01:02:28.729 --> 01:02:32.923
...tuning and lubricating itself,
replacing worn parts.


754
01:02:33.096 --> 01:02:35.288
I have reason to believe
that 16 years ago...


755
01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:37.394
...a minor alteration was performed...

756
01:02:37.562 --> 01:02:41.222
...throughout the entire

757
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:45.886
But what's it all for?

758
01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:48.519
Sometimes the gauges register a little...

759
01:02:48.696 --> 01:02:52.526
...when the buck deer fight in autumn
or when the birds fly over in the spring.


760
01:02:52.696 --> 01:02:54.389
Nearly a whole dial became active...

761
01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:57.619
...when your ship first approached
from deep space.


762
01:02:57.829 --> 01:03:01.125
I'll show you a section
of one of the power units.


763
01:03:02.896 --> 01:03:06.384
These units are sunk in
the body of the planet...


764
01:03:06.562 --> 01:03:09.085
...50 miles right below our feet.

765
01:03:09.262 --> 01:03:12.251
Now, be sure and look
only in the mirror.


766
01:03:12.429 --> 01:03:16.123
Man does not behold the face
of the Gorgon and live.


767
01:03:24.196 --> 01:03:28.287
Ninety-two hundred
thermonuclear reactors in tandem.


768
01:03:28.462 --> 01:03:33.020
The harnessed power
of an exploding planetary system.


769
01:03:40.429 --> 01:03:42.725
All hands, stand clear of fence area.

770
01:03:42.896 --> 01:03:45.453
All right, Quinn, turn it up.

771
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:49.852
- Have you tested it yet, Bosun?
- Right away, sir.


772
01:03:59.262 --> 01:04:02.251
- There you are, sir.
- Very good.


773
01:04:06.262 --> 01:04:10.217
Lieutenant, having completed
my washing-up duties after chow...


774
01:04:10.396 --> 01:04:14.556
...I request the lieutenant's permission
to take a walk outside the perimeter, sir.


775
01:04:14.729 --> 01:04:18.388
- There's nothing out there.
- But there is, sir. I mean...


776
01:04:18.562 --> 01:04:21.085
...I thought it might brighten
the boys' mess a bit...


777
01:04:21.262 --> 01:04:26.059
...you know, if l... If I could find
a few wild radishes or something.


778
01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:28.718
I don't know what
you're lying about, but get back...


779
01:04:28.896 --> 01:04:31.384
...before the skipper checks in
or we'll be skinned.


780
01:04:31.562 --> 01:04:35.619
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you.
- Quinn, this is Farman.


781
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:38.125
Kill the power on the fence.

782
01:04:40.629 --> 01:04:42.424
All right, put it back on.

783
01:05:00.729 --> 01:05:03.217
Four hundred and eighty pints.

784
01:05:03.596 --> 01:05:05.926
As you requested.

785
01:05:06.096 --> 01:05:08.721
Total, 60 gallons.

786
01:05:08.896 --> 01:05:11.885
Genuine Kansas City bourbon.

787
01:05:16.629 --> 01:05:19.095
It's smooth too.

788
01:05:26.763 --> 01:05:29.092
Robby, I ain't never gonna forget this.

789
01:05:29.262 --> 01:05:33.456
Anytime you're hard up for a couple of
gallons of lube oil, you just let me know.


790
01:05:38.963 --> 01:05:41.451
What's up?
Somebody coming this way?


791
01:05:42.696 --> 01:05:46.719
No, sir, nothing coming this way.

792
01:05:52.696 --> 01:05:55.093
Lieutenant, the fence is shorting.

793
01:06:00.696 --> 01:06:05.253
- Shall I shut down the current, sir?
- No. No, it's stopped now.


794
01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:07.520
Check the system
first thing in the morning.


795
01:06:07.696 --> 01:06:09.218
Aye, sir.

796
01:06:50.963 --> 01:06:53.690
It's strange how that fence
just shorted out.


797
01:06:53.863 --> 01:06:55.761
Yeah.

798
01:07:04.929 --> 01:07:06.554
You're too arbitrary, commander.

799
01:07:06.729 --> 01:07:09.786
Perhaps I do not choose
to be dictated to in my own world.


800
01:07:09.963 --> 01:07:12.861
Dr. Morbius, a scientific find
of this magnitude...


801
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.359
...has got to be under
United Planet supervision.


802
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:18.586
- No one man should monopolize it.
- For the past two hours...


803
01:07:18.763 --> 01:07:22.024
...Iâ€™ve been expecting you to make
exactly that asinine statement.


804
01:07:22.195 --> 01:07:23.627
Just one moment, commander.

805
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:26.420
For close on 20 years now
I've been constantly...


806
01:07:26.596 --> 01:07:29.721
...and I hope dispassionately,
considering this very problem.


807
01:07:29.896 --> 01:07:33.953
And I have come to the unalterable
conclusion that man is unfit, as yet...


808
01:07:34.129 --> 01:07:37.254
...to receive such knowledge,
such almost limitless power.


809
01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:41.020
Whereas Morbius,
with his artificially expanded intellect...


810
01:07:41.195 --> 01:07:44.923
...is now ideally suited to administer
this power for the whole human race.


811
01:07:45.095 --> 01:07:46.561
Precisely, doctor.

812
01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:49.888
Such portions of the Krell science,
as I may from time to time...


813
01:07:50.095 --> 01:07:52.687
...deem suitable and safe,
I shall dispense to Earth.


814
01:07:52.863 --> 01:07:54.852
Other portions I shall withhold.

815
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:58.018
And in this I shall be answerable
exclusively...


816
01:07:58.195 --> 01:08:00.684
...to my own conscience
and judgment.


817
01:08:00.863 --> 01:08:03.385
Dr. Morbius, in the absence
of special instructions...


818
01:08:03.562 --> 01:08:06.528
...you leave me
in a very awkward position. L...


819
01:08:06.896 --> 01:08:09.293
- Commander? Commander Adams.
- Speaking, lieutenant.


820
01:08:09.462 --> 01:08:11.950
Skipper, the chief's been murdered.

821
01:08:12.696 --> 01:08:13.956
Quinn, murdered?

822
01:08:14.129 --> 01:08:15.891
He was alone,
working on the monitor.


823
01:08:16.062 --> 01:08:18.426
The rest of us were all outside
on guard duty. L...


824
01:08:18.596 --> 01:08:20.687
- How was it done?
- Done?


825
01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:24.727
Skipper, his body is plastered
all over the communications room.


826
01:08:25.195 --> 01:08:27.855
All right, leave everything as it is.
We're on our way.


827
01:08:46.062 --> 01:08:48.324
It's started again.

828
01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:56.892
Is that it?

829
01:08:57.062 --> 01:09:01.892
I tried to make this plaster model
from the footprints we found.


830
01:09:05.562 --> 01:09:08.756
Thirty-seven inches by 19.

831
01:09:09.763 --> 01:09:12.627
Why, it's fantastic.

832
01:09:14.562 --> 01:09:16.187
Doc, I don't understand.

833
01:09:16.362 --> 01:09:19.590
Whatever walks on this would be
an opponent for a man with a club...


834
01:09:19.763 --> 01:09:21.729
...but with our weapons,
Quinn could've...


835
01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:26.850
No, skipper. This thing runs counter to
every known law of adaptive evolution.


836
01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.892
What do you mean?

837
01:09:29.596 --> 01:09:32.084
Well, notice this structure here.

838
01:09:32.396 --> 01:09:35.191
Characteristic of a four-footed animal.

839
01:09:35.362 --> 01:09:39.021
Yet our visitor last night
left the tracks of a biped.


840
01:09:39.928 --> 01:09:42.258
Primarily a ground animal too.

841
01:09:42.429 --> 01:09:45.589
Yet this claw could only belong
to an arboreal creature...


842
01:09:45.763 --> 01:09:49.217
...like some impossible tree sloth.

843
01:09:49.396 --> 01:09:53.761
It just doesn't fit into normal nature
anywhere in the galaxy. It's a nightmare.


844
01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:56.019
Is that what you made
out of that footprint?


845
01:09:56.195 --> 01:09:58.559
I think it's fairly close.

846
01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:03.120
Pardon me, commander, are you ready
to hold discipline on the cook, sir?


847
01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:06.454
Yeah, let's...
Let's have him.


848
01:10:08.862 --> 01:10:12.885
I'm obliged to remind you, sir, that I
gave him permission to go out last night.


849
01:10:13.062 --> 01:10:15.051
Did you give him permission
to get drunk?


850
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:16.627
Drunk, sir? Me, sir?

851
01:10:16.862 --> 01:10:18.624
Well, ask Dr. Ostrow, sir.

852
01:10:18.828 --> 01:10:21.624
Four pints of 120-proof bourbon
without a trace of hangover.


853
01:10:21.828 --> 01:10:23.419
Now, that ain't natural, sir.

854
01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:26.084
Besides, why did that robot
argue me into drinking...


855
01:10:26.262 --> 01:10:28.125
...all that whiskey
in the first place?


856
01:10:28.329 --> 01:10:31.523
- You were with the robot last night?
- Yes, sir.


857
01:10:31.696 --> 01:10:34.855
Him and me, we kind of got to
toasting each other's good health.


858
01:10:35.029 --> 01:10:38.018
Just for cordial
interplanetary relations, you understand.


859
01:10:38.195 --> 01:10:41.684
And that's all the time?
Even while the chief was being killed?


860
01:10:41.862 --> 01:10:43.761
Well, certainly, sir.

861
01:10:43.928 --> 01:10:47.361
I hope you don't think I could
have got that stiff in five minutes.


862
01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:51.352
All right, dismissed.

863
01:10:56.762 --> 01:11:01.058
- Well, I guess that washes the robot up.
- Where does that leave us for suspects?


864
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:03.854
Maybe it leaves us
with the same one.


865
01:11:04.062 --> 01:11:06.119
Maybe we ought to drop over
to that lab...


866
01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:08.920
...and get our IQ's boosted
a couple 100 percent.


867
01:11:09.095 --> 01:11:11.754
Sir, the burial detail is ready.

868
01:11:14.029 --> 01:11:18.052
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

869
01:11:21.095 --> 01:11:24.186
- All right, dismissed.
- Company dismissed.


870
01:11:33.396 --> 01:11:35.521
Fine technician.

871
01:11:36.462 --> 01:11:38.428
A good shipmate.

872
01:11:38.596 --> 01:11:41.720
And that's a good epitaph
for any man.


873
01:11:48.195 --> 01:11:49.684
Good day, Dr. Morbius.

874
01:11:49.862 --> 01:11:52.953
I dare say neither of us
slept any last night.


875
01:11:53.129 --> 01:11:55.095
That's a pretty close guess.

876
01:11:55.262 --> 01:11:58.023
I warned you
while your ship was still in space.


877
01:11:58.195 --> 01:12:00.956
I begged you not to land
on this planet.


878
01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:04.754
Believe me, commander,
that is only a foretaste.


879
01:12:04.928 --> 01:12:07.326
The Belerephon pattern
is being woven again.


880
01:12:08.695 --> 01:12:12.923
Remain here, and the next attack
on your party...


881
01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:17.460
...will be more deadly and general.

882
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:20.220
How do you know that?

883
01:12:21.562 --> 01:12:23.686
Know? I...

884
01:12:24.195 --> 01:12:26.252
I seem to visualize it.

885
01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.258
I...

886
01:12:29.329 --> 01:12:32.386
If you wish, call it a...

887
01:12:33.095 --> 01:12:35.061
A premonition.

888
01:12:49.895 --> 01:12:51.555
What do you make of that, skipper?

889
01:12:51.728 --> 01:12:54.593
I'd say it sounded like an ultimatum.

890
01:12:54.962 --> 01:12:56.428
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.


891
01:13:00.862 --> 01:13:01.885
- Bosun.
- Aye, aye, sir.


892
01:13:02.062 --> 01:13:04.426
- I want a clear field of fire.
- Aye, aye, sir.


893
01:13:04.596 --> 01:13:05.619
- Randall.
- Sir?


894
01:13:05.828 --> 01:13:07.454
How soon will radar
be operational?


895
01:13:07.628 --> 01:13:08.787
Operating right now, sir.

896
01:13:08.962 --> 01:13:11.451
- Good. You keep right on it yourself.
- Aye, aye, sir.


897
01:13:11.628 --> 01:13:14.026
- The M.A. Alert is completed?
- Aye, aye, sir.


898
01:13:14.195 --> 01:13:15.854
Fine.

899
01:13:16.029 --> 01:13:18.427
Activate main batteries.

900
01:13:23.928 --> 01:13:25.917
Alarm for test.

901
01:13:33.195 --> 01:13:34.820
Fire.

902
01:13:46.529 --> 01:13:48.461
Check, good.

903
01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.427
Oh, lieutenant, you got
your trouble squad in hand?


904
01:13:55.595 --> 01:13:58.084
Yes, sir, they're in hand,
but they're trigger-happy.


905
01:13:58.262 --> 01:14:01.353
They're sort of edgy to see
whatever's out there.


906
01:14:02.362 --> 01:14:04.055
Oh, Jerry.

907
01:14:07.396 --> 01:14:11.123
Look, this may be a big deal
coming up.


908
01:14:11.928 --> 01:14:13.451
I'm sorry if I've leaned on you.

909
01:14:13.628 --> 01:14:16.924
- You've got to understand...
- Stop knocking yourself out, skipper.


910
01:14:17.095 --> 01:14:19.357
She picked the right man.

911
01:14:21.862 --> 01:14:24.226
- What is it?
- Sir, radar just picked up something.


912
01:14:24.396 --> 01:14:26.055
- Where?
- At the head of the arroyo.


913
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:29.389
- Moving?
- This way, sir. Slowly.


914
01:14:35.396 --> 01:14:37.623
Automatic control.

915
01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:45.186
Batteries, fire.

916
01:14:49.029 --> 01:14:51.961
Batteries, hold fire.

917
01:14:52.728 --> 01:14:56.854
- Can you see anything out there, Doc?
- Nothing.


918
01:14:58.429 --> 01:15:01.588
Batteries, fire.

919
01:15:05.462 --> 01:15:08.360
Batteries, cease fire.

920
01:15:08.628 --> 01:15:10.685
- Randall.
- Dead on target, sir.


921
01:15:10.862 --> 01:15:14.589
- Good. Give me audio-com.
- Aye, aye, sir.


922
01:15:14.762 --> 01:15:17.354
Your attention.
This may be a ruse to divert us...


923
01:15:17.528 --> 01:15:19.517
...from some other part of the perimeter.

924
01:15:19.695 --> 01:15:23.923
You men will continue watching on
your own immediate fronts. That is all.


925
01:15:30.262 --> 01:15:33.057
- What?
- It just stopped at the foot of the pass.


926
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:35.956
- You sure you got a real blip there?
- Big as a house, sir.


927
01:15:36.129 --> 01:15:38.095
We were dead on target
with both bursts.


928
01:15:38.262 --> 01:15:39.921
It's coming on again.

929
01:15:40.095 --> 01:15:42.084
- Straight across?
- It shows here.


930
01:15:43.029 --> 01:15:44.359
It's still coming.

931
01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:46.824
Grey, Strong, set up a crossfire
on those rocks.


932
01:16:22.329 --> 01:16:23.589
Fire!

933
01:16:25.862 --> 01:16:28.623
Skipper, the blasted thing's invisible.

934
01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:14.025
Jerry!

935
01:17:23.828 --> 01:17:24.885
Fire!

936
01:17:50.628 --> 01:17:53.254
- Father!
- Alta.


937
01:17:53.828 --> 01:17:55.953
- Father!
- Altaira.


938
01:17:57.029 --> 01:17:59.551
- Alta. Alta, where are you?
- Father.


939
01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:03.785
- What is it? What's the matter?
- I just had a terrible dream.


940
01:18:03.962 --> 01:18:06.519
There was blood and fire
and thunder...


941
01:18:06.695 --> 01:18:10.128
...and something awful was moving
in the middle of it.


942
01:18:10.328 --> 01:18:12.385
I could hear the roar and bellow.

943
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:14.754
Now, now, now, you know
a dream can't hurt you.


944
01:18:14.928 --> 01:18:17.792
Not me. Not us.

945
01:18:17.962 --> 01:18:22.088
The thing I saw was trying to break
into camp. It was gonna kill...


946
01:18:22.528 --> 01:18:25.858
You'll take care of him for me,
won't you, Father? You'll protect him.


947
01:18:26.029 --> 01:18:28.052
My darling,
I'm completely helpless...


948
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:31.218
...as long as he remains here
so willfully.


949
01:18:31.395 --> 01:18:34.520
Come now. Come.

950
01:18:42.395 --> 01:18:44.861
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir.


951
01:18:47.628 --> 01:18:50.685
- Get those graves dug. Keep busy.
- Right. The busier the better.


952
01:18:50.862 --> 01:18:54.919
Randall, give me audio-com.

953
01:18:56.595 --> 01:19:01.618
Well, men, whatever it was,
our main battery stopped it.


954
01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:03.885
You believe that?

955
01:19:05.062 --> 01:19:07.550
No, it just went away
for some reason. It'll be back.


956
01:19:09.628 --> 01:19:16.084
Doc, an invisible being that cannot
be disintegrated by atomic fission.


957
01:19:16.561 --> 01:19:19.857
No, skipper,
that is a scientific impossibility.


958
01:19:20.029 --> 01:19:22.586
Hypnotic illusions
don't tear people apart.


959
01:19:22.762 --> 01:19:25.626
That's true enough,
but any organism...


960
01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:28.726
...dense enough to survive
three billion electron volts...


961
01:19:28.895 --> 01:19:32.725
...would have to be made
of solid nuclear material.


962
01:19:32.895 --> 01:19:34.884
It would sink
to the center of this planet.


963
01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:37.892
Well, you saw it yourself,
standing in those neutron beams.


964
01:19:38.062 --> 01:19:39.357
And there's your answer.

965
01:19:39.528 --> 01:19:41.926
It must've been renewing
its molecular structure...


966
01:19:42.095 --> 01:19:44.720
...from one microsecond to the next.

967
01:19:47.862 --> 01:19:48.919
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.


968
01:19:49.095 --> 01:19:51.617
- I want the tractor.
- Ready, sir.


969
01:19:51.828 --> 01:19:54.794
We pick up the girl and her father
whether they like it or not?


970
01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:58.416
Section 86A, evacuate all civilians
from disaster area.


971
01:19:58.595 --> 01:20:01.061
You left out
two very important words:


972
01:20:01.228 --> 01:20:02.751
"Where feasible."

973
01:20:02.928 --> 01:20:05.860
Now, if you'll remember
the Belerephon expedition...


974
01:20:06.029 --> 01:20:08.460
...their ship was vaporized
trying to lift off.


975
01:20:08.628 --> 01:20:11.219
Which makes it a gilt-edged priority
that one of us...


976
01:20:11.395 --> 01:20:14.623
...gets into that Krell lab
and takes that brain boost.


977
01:20:16.461 --> 01:20:18.518
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir.


978
01:20:20.261 --> 01:20:22.750
I'm leaving you in command.
Get the ship operational.


979
01:20:22.928 --> 01:20:25.359
Do your best to wait it out
for me and the doctor.


980
01:20:25.528 --> 01:20:28.120
But the second
that fence shorts again, you lift off...


981
01:20:28.328 --> 01:20:31.783
...and report back to Earth base
on conditions in this sector.


982
01:20:31.962 --> 01:20:33.860
Right, skipper.

983
01:20:45.561 --> 01:20:48.186
All right, get everything
aboard ship.


984
01:20:48.361 --> 01:20:49.725
We're pulling out.

985
01:21:12.762 --> 01:21:14.751
No lights showing.

986
01:21:15.029 --> 01:21:16.824
Yeah.

987
01:21:18.461 --> 01:21:21.950
Look, Doc, in case we make it
into that lab...


988
01:21:22.129 --> 01:21:25.253
...Iâ€™ll take the first go
at the IQ booster.


989
01:21:25.862 --> 01:21:29.453
- You hear me?
- I hear you.


990
01:21:45.062 --> 01:21:49.426
I am monitored to admit no one
at this hour.


991
01:21:51.628 --> 01:21:54.026
Well, that sounded final.

992
01:21:55.928 --> 01:21:58.689
Maybe if we reasoned with him.

993
01:22:04.194 --> 01:22:07.558
My beams are focused
on your blasters, gentlemen.


994
01:22:17.595 --> 01:22:21.857
Hasn't he got a built-in rule against
wringing our little necks for us?


995
01:22:22.428 --> 01:22:23.917
That is true, sir.

996
01:22:24.128 --> 01:22:27.891
Yet I am monitored
to admit no one.


997
01:22:29.595 --> 01:22:31.754
Robby, let them in.

998
01:22:31.928 --> 01:22:33.587
Alta, this is your father's order.

999
01:22:33.762 --> 01:22:35.955
- Now, get out of the way.
- Quiet.


1000
01:22:36.628 --> 01:22:41.356
Robby, emergency cancellation
Archimedes.


1001
01:22:48.128 --> 01:22:50.219
Why are you here?

1002
01:22:51.628 --> 01:22:56.526
We were attacked. Three more
men dead, including Jerry Farman.


1003
01:23:04.128 --> 01:23:05.924
I don't know...

1004
01:23:06.094 --> 01:23:10.789
...it was just some kind of
big outline in the disintegrator beams.


1005
01:23:10.962 --> 01:23:14.394
- And you can't explain it?
- No.


1006
01:23:15.928 --> 01:23:18.416
Well, anyway, we fought it,
and we lost.


1007
01:23:18.595 --> 01:23:21.618
- I figure it'll be back.
- Then you must leave now.


1008
01:23:21.828 --> 01:23:23.191
I'm not going without you.

1009
01:23:23.361 --> 01:23:26.555
But I can't possibly leave him alone,
I just can't.


1010
01:23:26.728 --> 01:23:30.683
- Then we'll take him.
- By force? I can't agree to that either.


1011
01:23:30.862 --> 01:23:33.794
Can't you? You don't realize
what's loose on this planet.


1012
01:23:33.962 --> 01:23:35.723
But I'm immune,
like both my parents.


1013
01:23:35.895 --> 01:23:38.383
I don't believe it.
Nothing could be immune to that.


1014
01:23:38.561 --> 01:23:41.925
Oh, darling, darling, please go.

1015
01:23:46.628 --> 01:23:50.958
- Please, please, if you love me, go.
- Alta.


1016
01:23:51.128 --> 01:23:53.458
Doc, will you talk some sense
to this girl?


1017
01:23:53.628 --> 01:23:55.253
I'm in over my head.

1018
01:23:55.428 --> 01:23:57.053
Doc?

1019
01:23:57.228 --> 01:23:59.023
Doc.

1020
01:24:00.695 --> 01:24:02.354
Doc.

1021
01:24:03.194 --> 01:24:05.524
On the sofa, Robby.

1022
01:24:16.595 --> 01:24:19.390
So you took the brain boost, huh?

1023
01:24:19.828 --> 01:24:22.316
You ought to see my new mind...

1024
01:24:22.862 --> 01:24:24.885
...up there in lights.

1025
01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:27.323
Bigger than his now.

1026
01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.760
Now, easy, Doc.

1027
01:24:29.928 --> 01:24:34.257
Morbius was too close to the problem.

1028
01:24:34.561 --> 01:24:37.356
The Krell had completed their project.

1029
01:24:37.528 --> 01:24:39.460
The big machine...

1030
01:24:39.628 --> 01:24:42.093
...no instrumentalities...

1031
01:24:42.428 --> 01:24:44.451
...true creation.

1032
01:24:44.828 --> 01:24:46.293
Come on, Doc, let's have it.

1033
01:24:46.461 --> 01:24:50.018
- But the Krell forgot one thing.
- Yes, what?


1034
01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:52.584
Monsters, John.

1035
01:24:53.094 --> 01:24:55.185
Monsters from the id.

1036
01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:57.384
The id? What's that?

1037
01:24:57.561 --> 01:24:59.618
Talk, Doc.

1038
01:25:03.461 --> 01:25:05.120
Doc.

1039
01:25:08.595 --> 01:25:11.026
Oh, Doc.

1040
01:25:12.261 --> 01:25:14.193
Doc.

1041
01:25:27.328 --> 01:25:29.760
How romantic.

1042
01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:36.185
The fool.
The meddling idiot.


1043
01:25:36.361 --> 01:25:40.589
As though his ape's brain
could contain the secrets of the Krell.


1044
01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:43.686
Father, he's dead.

1045
01:25:43.862 --> 01:25:46.384
He was warned,
and now he's paid.


1046
01:25:46.561 --> 01:25:51.357
Let him be buried with the other
victims of human greed and folly.


1047
01:25:56.028 --> 01:25:58.187
Morbius...

1048
01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:00.883
...you wanted me
to make a choice.


1049
01:26:01.228 --> 01:26:02.853
Now you've chosen for me.

1050
01:26:03.028 --> 01:26:05.790
- Alta.
- I'm ready to go with you, darling.


1051
01:26:05.961 --> 01:26:07.723
Altaira. No.

1052
01:26:07.894 --> 01:26:11.951
- I will place him in the tractor, sir.
- Thank you.


1053
01:26:12.595 --> 01:26:14.686
She mustn't do this.
She must be prevented.


1054
01:26:14.861 --> 01:26:16.452
Morbius, what is the id?

1055
01:26:16.628 --> 01:26:20.720
Young man, my daughter is planning
a foolish action, and she'll be punished.


1056
01:26:20.894 --> 01:26:23.883
- What is the id?
- Id, id, id.


1057
01:26:24.061 --> 01:26:25.721
It's a...

1058
01:26:25.894 --> 01:26:28.860
It's an obsolete term...

1059
01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:32.550
...Iâ€™m afraid, once used to describe...

1060
01:26:32.728 --> 01:26:36.455
...the elementary basis
of the subconscious mind.


1061
01:26:38.261 --> 01:26:40.625
Monsters from the id.

1062
01:26:42.328 --> 01:26:45.260
Monsters from the subconscious.

1063
01:26:47.428 --> 01:26:50.360
Of course, that's what Doc meant.

1064
01:26:50.961 --> 01:26:55.291
Morbius, the big machine,

1065
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:58.359
Enough power for a whole
population of creative geniuses.


1066
01:26:58.528 --> 01:27:00.551
Operated by remote control.

1067
01:27:00.728 --> 01:27:03.626
Morbius, operated by
the electromagnetic impulses...


1068
01:27:03.827 --> 01:27:07.282
...of individual Krell brains.
- To what purpose?


1069
01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:10.790
In return, that machine would
instantaneously project solid matter...


1070
01:27:10.961 --> 01:27:14.086
...to any point on the planet. In any
shape or color they might imagine.


1071
01:27:14.261 --> 01:27:16.886
For any purpose, Morbius.

1072
01:27:17.061 --> 01:27:19.118
Creation by mere thought.

1073
01:27:19.328 --> 01:27:21.521
Why haven't I seen this all along?

1074
01:27:23.128 --> 01:27:26.117
But like you, the Krell
forgot one deadly danger...


1075
01:27:26.328 --> 01:27:30.317
...their own subconscious hate
and lust for destruction.


1076
01:27:30.695 --> 01:27:34.525
The beast.
The mindless primitive.


1077
01:27:34.961 --> 01:27:38.018
Even the Krell must have evolved
from that beginning.


1078
01:27:38.861 --> 01:27:42.350
And so those mindless beasts
of the subconscious had access...


1079
01:27:42.528 --> 01:27:44.721
...to a machine that could
never be shut down.


1080
01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:47.849
The secret devil
of every soul on the planet...


1081
01:27:48.028 --> 01:27:51.392
...all set free at once
to loot and maim...


1082
01:27:51.561 --> 01:27:54.856
...and take revenge, 
Morbius, and kill.

1083
01:27:55.628 --> 01:27:58.855
My poor Krell.

1084
01:28:01.894 --> 01:28:06.224
After a million years
of shining sanity...


1085
01:28:07.528 --> 01:28:12.017
...they could hardly have understood
what power was destroying them.


1086
01:28:15.827 --> 01:28:17.759
Yes, young man...

1087
01:28:18.561 --> 01:28:23.754
...all very convincing,
but for one obvious fallacy.


1088
01:28:24.428 --> 01:28:28.622
The last Krell died

1089
01:28:28.827 --> 01:28:30.952
...but today, as we all know...

1090
01:28:31.128 --> 01:28:35.026
...there is still at large
on this planet, a living monster.


1091
01:28:35.695 --> 01:28:39.354
Your mind refuses
to face the conclusion.


1092
01:28:39.528 --> 01:28:41.391
What do you mean?

1093
01:28:41.927 --> 01:28:44.018
Morbius.

1094
01:28:45.761 --> 01:28:47.125
- Morbius.
- What?


1095
01:28:47.328 --> 01:28:50.055
Something is approaching
from the southwest.


1096
01:28:50.228 --> 01:28:53.092
It is now quite close.

1097
01:29:04.628 --> 01:29:06.617
- Could Robby be wrong?
- No, never.


1098
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:12.191
There it comes.

1099
01:29:25.628 --> 01:29:27.923
I feel sorry for you, young man.

1100
01:29:28.094 --> 01:29:30.958
Feel sorry for your daughter, Morbius.

1101
01:29:33.395 --> 01:29:35.452
It's listening.

1102
01:29:41.194 --> 01:29:42.524
Alta, go into my study.

1103
01:29:42.694 --> 01:29:45.126
- You still refuse to face the truth.
- What truth?


1104
01:29:45.328 --> 01:29:47.385
Morbius, that thing out there...

1105
01:29:47.561 --> 01:29:49.049
...it's you.
- You're insane.


1106
01:29:49.228 --> 01:29:52.388
How else would you have led it here
where Alta must see you torn to pieces?


1107
01:29:52.561 --> 01:29:54.924
Still think she's immune?
She's joined herself to me.


1108
01:29:55.094 --> 01:29:57.583
- Yes, and whatever comes, forever.
- Say it's a lie.


1109
01:29:57.761 --> 01:30:00.125
Let it hear you.
Tell it you don't love this man.


1110
01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.419
Not even if I could.

1111
01:30:07.061 --> 01:30:10.585
Stop it, Robby. Don't let it in.
Kill it, Robby.


1112
01:30:20.528 --> 01:30:22.357
It's no use.

1113
01:30:23.028 --> 01:30:24.551
He knows it's your other self.

1114
01:30:54.694 --> 01:30:56.456
We're safe.

1115
01:30:57.228 --> 01:30:59.591
Why did you jumble
that combination?


1116
01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:03.125
Whatever you know in here, your twin
self out in the tunnel knows too.


1117
01:31:03.328 --> 01:31:05.317
I'm not a monster, you...

1118
01:31:06.361 --> 01:31:09.452
We're all part monsters
in our subconscious...


1119
01:31:09.627 --> 01:31:12.253
...so we have laws and religion.
- Let me go.


1120
01:31:12.461 --> 01:31:16.688
You've got to listen.
We don't have much time.


1121
01:31:17.194 --> 01:31:20.956
Here. Here's where your mind
was artificially enlarged.


1122
01:31:21.128 --> 01:31:24.219
Consciously it lacked the power
to operate the great machine...


1123
01:31:24.395 --> 01:31:26.952
...but your subconscious had been
made strong enough.


1124
01:31:27.128 --> 01:31:29.458
- I won't hear you.
- You've got to listen.


1125
01:31:29.627 --> 01:31:33.082
Twenty years ago when your
comrades voted to return to Earth...


1126
01:31:33.261 --> 01:31:37.522
...you sent your secret id out
to murder them.


1127
01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.784
Not quite realizing it, of course...

1128
01:31:42.961 --> 01:31:45.552
...except maybe in your dreams.

1129
01:31:45.827 --> 01:31:47.759
What man can remember
his own dreams?


1130
01:31:47.927 --> 01:31:51.882
At least when our ship was approaching,
you remembered enough to warn us off.


1131
01:31:52.727 --> 01:31:56.887
But then when you thought we were
threatening your egomaniac empire...


1132
01:31:57.061 --> 01:32:00.289
...your subconscious sent
its id monster out again.


1133
01:32:00.461 --> 01:32:03.393
More deaths, Morbius.
More murder.


1134
01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.118
And now this too.
Harm my own daughter?


1135
01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:09.553
But now she's defying you, Morbius...

1136
01:32:09.727 --> 01:32:14.023
...and even in you, the loving father,
there still exists the mindless primitive...


1137
01:32:14.194 --> 01:32:18.024
...more enraged and more inflamed
with each new frustration.


1138
01:32:18.194 --> 01:32:20.456
So now you're whistling up
your monster again...


1139
01:32:20.627 --> 01:32:23.889
...to punish her for her disloyalty
and disobedience.


1140
01:32:25.094 --> 01:32:27.889
And if you don't do something
about it soon, Morbius...


1141
01:32:28.061 --> 01:32:30.720
...it's going to be coming
right through that door.


1142
01:32:36.261 --> 01:32:39.125
Solid Krell metal,

1143
01:32:39.328 --> 01:32:42.452
Look at your gauges. Look.

1144
01:32:42.694 --> 01:32:44.922
That machine is going
to supply your monster...


1145
01:32:45.128 --> 01:32:48.457
...with whatever amount of power
it requires to reach us.


1146
01:32:48.861 --> 01:32:50.191
Look now.

1147
01:32:59.428 --> 01:33:02.587
Red-hot.
Soon it'll be white-hot...


1148
01:33:02.761 --> 01:33:05.250
...then it'll soften and melt.

1149
01:33:15.328 --> 01:33:17.520
Alta, say you don't believe this of me.

1150
01:33:17.694 --> 01:33:19.183
Tell me you don't.

1151
01:33:31.894 --> 01:33:34.360
Then it must be true.

1152
01:33:34.527 --> 01:33:36.618
Yes, I must be guilty.

1153
01:33:36.827 --> 01:33:38.690
Then help us, darling.

1154
01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:42.385
I've known you. I've known you
great and noble like the Krell.


1155
01:33:59.627 --> 01:34:01.923
Guilty. Guilty.

1156
01:34:02.094 --> 01:34:07.424
My evil self is at that door,
and I have no power to stop it.


1157
01:34:37.927 --> 01:34:40.757
Stop. No further.
I deny you, I give you up.


1158
01:35:02.228 --> 01:35:05.751
Father. Oh, Father.

1159
01:35:08.527 --> 01:35:09.788
Son...

1160
01:35:11.494 --> 01:35:13.619
...turn that disc.

1161
01:35:20.128 --> 01:35:23.219
The switch, throw it.

1162
01:35:31.894 --> 01:35:34.519
In 24 hours...

1163
01:35:34.927 --> 01:35:41.190
...you must be

1164
01:35:42.827 --> 01:35:47.384
The Krell furnaces, chain reaction...

1165
01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:50.958
...they cannot be reversed.

1166
01:35:51.128 --> 01:35:53.026
Alta...

1167
01:35:55.028 --> 01:35:56.960
Oh, no.

1168
01:36:06.128 --> 01:36:08.685
Ninety-eight million point six.

1169
01:36:08.861 --> 01:36:10.884
We're clear now.

1170
01:36:12.961 --> 01:36:15.120
What an astrogator.

1171
01:36:15.894 --> 01:36:18.519
A genuine privilege, commander.

1172
01:36:18.694 --> 01:36:20.751
Activate main view plate.

1173
01:36:20.927 --> 01:36:23.256
Aye, aye, skipper.

1174
01:36:24.961 --> 01:36:29.916
That's Altair-4, the bright speck
below the star.


1175
01:36:30.761 --> 01:36:33.023
Fifteen seconds.

1176
01:36:35.927 --> 01:36:40.291
Yes, Alta, your father,
my shipmates...


1177
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:43.120
...all the stored knowledge
of the Krell.


1178
01:36:43.627 --> 01:36:47.616
Five seconds, four, three...

1179
01:36:47.827 --> 01:36:50.884
...two, one.

1180
01:37:00.894 --> 01:37:05.383
Alta, about a million years from now...

1181
01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.526
...the human race
will have crawled up to where...


1182
01:37:08.694 --> 01:37:14.854
...the Krell stood in their
great moment of triumph and tragedy...


1183
01:37:19.227 --> 01:37:22.387
...and your father's name
will shine again...


1184
01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:25.185
...like a beacon in the galaxy.

1185
01:37:26.227 --> 01:37:29.387
It's true...

1186
01:37:30.028 --> 01:37:33.892
...it will remind us
that we are, after all, not God.


1187
01:38:20.024 --> 01:38:21.014
