01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:29.800
You're camera ready? J-j-just
follow me, this way.


1563
01:11:29.802 --> 01:11:31.035
- We're gonna follow him.
- Yeah.


1564
01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:32.670
Can I sing my single?

1565
01:11:32.672 --> 01:11:34.575
I don't even know
where we're going.


1566
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:37.974
(gasp) Grandma!

1567
01:11:37.976 --> 01:11:40.445
Hi honey! I'll take one of
those.


1568
01:11:40.447 --> 01:11:42.045
Avery's gonna be so
happy you're here.


1569
01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:43.613
I wouldn't miss it.

1570
01:11:43.615 --> 01:11:45.515
Come on, Mom. Let's go find a
seat in the front, okay?


1571
01:11:45.517 --> 01:11:46.717
Hey, save me a seat, sugar.

1572
01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:47.951
I'm gonna run to the
ladies real quick.


1573
01:11:47.953 --> 01:11:49.120
- I will!
- Muah!


1574
01:11:49.122 --> 01:11:50.921
Hey, I'll save you a seat, too.

1575
01:11:50.923 --> 01:11:51.789
Thanks, Daddy!

1576
01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:52.793
You're welcome.

1577
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.726
Okay, let's go wish
your sister good luck.


1578
01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.728
I can't, Mama. I've got
signs to hand out.


1579
01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.063
Oh no, your friends can do it.
She'll be right back.


1580
01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:02.802
Come on. You lead the way.

1581
01:12:04.804 --> 01:12:06.036
Let's go in here.

1582
01:12:06.038 --> 01:12:07.004
Frances?

1583
01:12:07.006 --> 01:12:11.209
Amanda, dear! Wh-what
are you doing here?


1584
01:12:11.211 --> 01:12:13.244
My sisters are in the
competition.


1585
01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:15.112
Mr. Adams, I didn't see you!

1586
01:12:15.114 --> 01:12:17.948
Oh, Mr. Adams. Michael. Please.

1587
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:21.719
Amanda's that sweet girl I was
telling you about, Mikey.


1588
01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:24.088
I remember, Mom. Right, right.

1589
01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.156
Frances is you mother?

1590
01:12:25.158 --> 01:12:28.025
- Mmhmm.
- For 46 years now.


1591
01:12:28.027 --> 01:12:29.160
Such a small world.

1592
01:12:29.162 --> 01:12:31.161
(text message alert)

1593
01:12:31.163 --> 01:12:33.164
I gotta run,
but let's catch up after.


1594
01:12:33.166 --> 01:12:34.232
- Sure.
- Okay, dear.


1595
01:12:34.234 --> 01:12:35.836
Break a leg!

1596
01:12:37.837 --> 01:12:38.603
You okay right there?

1597
01:12:38.605 --> 01:12:39.740
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.


1598
01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:47.545
Mandy! Wait up. I uhm, I just
wanted to say thank you


1599
01:12:47.547 --> 01:12:50.046
for being such a good
friend to my mom.


1600
01:12:50.048 --> 01:12:52.583
She thinks the
world of you.


1601
01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:54.184
She's pretty great too.

1602
01:12:54.186 --> 01:12:56.987
And she's helping more
than you know.


1603
01:12:56.989 --> 01:12:57.990
I gotta run.

1604
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.599
(knock on door)

1605
01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.833
Well, hello!

1606
01:13:08.835 --> 01:13:11.701
Hi Mr. Miller. Just letting
you know, uh house is open.


1607
01:13:11.703 --> 01:13:12.702
60 minutes to curtain.

1608
01:13:12.704 --> 01:13:15.973
Oh good. Great. And what was
your name again?


1609
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.543
Uhmm, Billy. I'm the stage
manager here.


1610
01:13:18.545 --> 01:13:22.079
Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.
Great, thank you.


1611
01:13:22.081 --> 01:13:26.784
And uhh, what exactly did that
mean? The house is, uh,


1612
01:13:26.786 --> 01:13:29.286
"open" and and the curtain?

1613
01:13:29.288 --> 01:13:32.322
Uh, the audience has been let
into the theatre,


1614
01:13:32.324 --> 01:13:34.291
and there's sixty minutes until
the show starts.


1615
01:13:34.293 --> 01:13:35.726
That's handy information.

1616
01:13:35.728 --> 01:13:37.128
Yeah, most definitely.

1617
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.696
This is a little different than
my television gig.


1618
01:13:39.698 --> 01:13:40.700
- I'm sure.
- Yeah.


1619
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:46.771
Anyway, uhm, yeah,
sure, I'll be right there!


1620
01:13:46.773 --> 01:13:49.906
I don't mean to cut ya off, but
I have to get back to work.


1621
01:13:49.908 --> 01:13:51.241
Of course, I understand.
Silly me.


1622
01:13:51.243 --> 01:13:53.044
Okay. Thank you Mr. Miller.

1623
01:13:53.046 --> 01:13:54.045
Thank you, Bobby.

1624
01:13:54.047 --> 01:13:57.951
Billy. This is gonna be a
really long night.


1625
01:13:59.953 --> 01:14:00.985
(Clare screams)

1626
01:14:00.987 --> 01:14:03.053
40, we already know.

1627
01:14:03.055 --> 01:14:08.259
Oh Avery. You just look simply
divine. Aww, come here.


1628
01:14:08.261 --> 01:14:10.728
Uh, makeup. Yeah. I'm pretty
much ready to go.


1629
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:14.764
Well, Emily and I just wanted to
come by and wish you all


1630
01:14:14.766 --> 01:14:16.767
good luck and to break legs.

1631
01:14:16.769 --> 01:14:17.367
(Clare laughs)

1632
01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:18.369
We got this.

1633
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.271
I can't wait to be in the music
video with you!


1634
01:14:20.273 --> 01:14:21.071
Ohhhhh!

1635
01:14:21.073 --> 01:14:23.042
Yeah. Me too.

1636
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:26.613
30, we know.

1637
01:14:31.984 --> 01:14:34.751
Please, we need some
quiet time to focus.


1638
01:14:34.753 --> 01:14:39.389
Right. I totally get it.
Good luck, Avery.


1639
01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:42.360
I just know you're gonna be
straight up great.


1640
01:14:42.362 --> 01:14:44.961
(Clare screams)

1641
01:14:44.963 --> 01:14:45.830
K...

1642
01:14:45.832 --> 01:14:47.164
Ohhhhh!

1643
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:48.165
Bye.

1644
01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:53.670
You guys, just do you.
I love your lipstick.


1645
01:14:53.672 --> 01:14:55.039
This is like kinda...

1646
01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:55.872
(knock on door)

1647
01:14:55.874 --> 01:14:57.875
Places.

1648
01:14:57.877 --> 01:14:59.809
Okay girls. You have
the best routine


1649
01:14:59.811 --> 01:15:01.211
and are the best dancers.

1650
01:15:01.213 --> 01:15:03.246
So just keep to the
beat and have fun.


1651
01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:04.714
You've got this.

1652
01:15:04.716 --> 01:15:07.317
K, huddle up.

1653
01:15:07.319 --> 01:15:09.120
On three, let's do
"to the beat".


1654
01:15:09.122 --> 01:15:09.786
Ready?

1655
01:15:09.788 --> 01:15:10.655
Okay.

1656
01:15:10.657 --> 01:15:11.322
[Mandy] 1..

1657
01:15:11.324 --> 01:15:14.126
[All] 2, 3!
To the beat!


1658
01:15:17.063 --> 01:15:18.696
(knock on door)

1659
01:15:18.698 --> 01:15:19.967
Places.

1660
01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:26.437
(knock on door)

1661
01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:28.675
Places, Mr. Miller. Let's fly
like an eagle.


1662
01:15:30.676 --> 01:15:32.876
(no dialogue)

1663
01:15:32.878 --> 01:15:37.781
Places. You gotta.... places
means you... come on.


1664
01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.418
We gotta go. Places means
you go into your place.


1665
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.120
[Announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls,


1666
01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:45.790
your host for tonight doesn't
need much of an introduction.


1667
01:15:45.792 --> 01:15:47.290
You might even think
you know him.


1668
01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:49.059
Direct from Hollywood
to you,


1669
01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:51.362
give it up for Steven Miller!

1670
01:15:51.364 --> 01:15:54.368
(applause)

1671
01:16:00.073 --> 01:16:03.374
Thank you, thank you. Thank
you. Now I know you were all


1672
01:16:03.376 --> 01:16:05.710
probably expecting
The Steven Miller Band.


1673
01:16:05.712 --> 01:16:06.777
(rim shot)

1674
01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:09.379
I didn't get it either.
(chuckle)


1675
01:16:09.381 --> 01:16:13.017
So tonight is a very special
night. One of these lucky groups


1676
01:16:13.019 --> 01:16:16.487
of dancers will be selected as
the winner and will be featured


1677
01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:20.223
in a new music video with the
amazing pop sensation


1678
01:16:20.225 --> 01:16:22.192
Mr. Chris Trousdale.

1679
01:16:22.194 --> 01:16:24.997
(applause)

1680
01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.198
Must be very exciting.

1681
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.102
Now, before we get things
started, let's meet out amazing


1682
01:16:31.104 --> 01:16:32.902
celebrity judges for tonight.

1683
01:16:32.904 --> 01:16:35.906
You remember him as
Ned from the hit TV show


1684
01:16:35.908 --> 01:16:38.476
"Ned's Declassified: School
Survival Guide" and so much


1685
01:16:38.478 --> 01:16:40.811
more and he's an
awesome singer, too!


1686
01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:43.813
Give a warm welcome to
Devon Werkheiser!


1687
01:16:43.815 --> 01:16:48.952
(applause)

1688
01:16:48.954 --> 01:16:52.055
Everybody loved her as Camille
in the Step Up movies


1689
01:16:52.057 --> 01:16:53.491
and Caitlin from Camp Rock,

1690
01:16:53.493 --> 01:16:55.992
and, man, can she
sing and dance.


1691
01:16:55.994 --> 01:16:57.260
Let's make her feel at home.

1692
01:16:57.262 --> 01:16:58.862
Here's Alyson Stoner!

1693
01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:03.467
(applause)

1694
01:17:03.469 --> 01:17:06.269
And finally, this guy has
been in everything


1695
01:17:06.271 --> 01:17:08.238
including all those
Maze Runner movies.


1696
01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.839
You know, I like to pretend
I'm in the movie


1697
01:17:09.841 --> 01:17:11.142
when I'm trying to
get out of Ikea.


1698
01:17:11.144 --> 01:17:11.843
(laugh)

1699
01:17:11.845 --> 01:17:14.478
It's a nightmare. Thanks, Mom.

1700
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.814
And he sings too! Wow, you guys
are all so talented.


1701
01:17:17.816 --> 01:17:19.817
You know, maybe we should have a
talk after the show.


1702
01:17:19.819 --> 01:17:22.055
Maybe start a du-op group or
something?


1703
01:17:23.989 --> 01:17:25.388
You think about it, never mind.

1704
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:28.259
Alright, here he is,
Dexter Darden!


1705
01:17:28.261 --> 01:17:30.263
(applause)

1706
01:17:33.533 --> 01:17:36.834
Okay, so what I wanna do now is
bring out the finalists


1707
01:17:36.836 --> 01:17:38.068
and their teams.

1708
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:42.906
We have Mackie Castillo, Avery
Adams, and Jillian Starkel!


1709
01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.510
(applause)

1710
01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:51.314
Alright, so ladies, first off,
congratulations.


1711
01:17:51.316 --> 01:17:53.284
I'm just glad it's you
and not me.


1712
01:17:53.286 --> 01:17:55.585
And you're just so amazing. I
mean at your age,


1713
01:17:55.587 --> 01:17:57.821
I still had braces, on my legs.

1714
01:17:57.823 --> 01:17:59.557
(chuckles)

1715
01:17:59.559 --> 01:18:01.325
Now you know the rules,
but remember,


1716
01:18:01.327 --> 01:18:03.861
just two minutes for your
routine, all right?


1717
01:18:03.863 --> 01:18:08.833
Now, in this... thank you... in
this basket there's three


1718
01:18:08.835 --> 01:18:11.835
pieces of paper numbered
one, two and three.


1719
01:18:11.837 --> 01:18:14.338
We're gonna go in alphabetical
order to draw. That means Avery


1720
01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:15.141
your first.

1721
01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:19.576
Alright... there ya go. Uh, let's
wait until everyone has a number


1722
01:18:19.578 --> 01:18:21.782
Uh, Jillian, you're next.

1723
01:18:22.582 --> 01:18:25.515
And Mackie, you take
the last one.


1724
01:18:25.517 --> 01:18:27.420
All right ladies,
open your numbers.


1725
01:18:30.422 --> 01:18:33.890
And looks like Jillian Starkel
is first up.


1726
01:18:33.892 --> 01:18:35.425
Let's make her feel welcome!

up just to spy on us.


1753
01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:08.018
Well, then we can say thank you
after. Because now, we have a

her name is Mia.

I think I'm about to have a
panic attack or throw up.

I can't do it Mandy.

[Steve Miller] Wow! Wow!

1772
01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:07.510
Boy, I tell ya, those other
teams have their work cut


1773
01:21:07.512 --> 01:21:09.713
out for sure. Let's see what the
judges have to say!


1774
01:21:09.715 --> 01:21:13.049
You guys did great.
You guys did great.


1775
01:21:13.051 --> 01:21:17.420
You're great energy, uhm,
you're all fantastic dancers.


1776
01:21:17.422 --> 01:21:22.026
Uhm, I saw a lot of different
elements that I liked, uh,


1777
01:21:22.028 --> 01:21:26.030
like changing up formations,
you were whacking,


1778
01:21:26.032 --> 01:21:29.599
you were doing like ballet,
jazz, I saw everything


1779
01:21:29.601 --> 01:21:31.101
and that was really awesome.

1780
01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:34.037
Uh, the one thing that's
throwing me off is,


1781
01:21:34.039 --> 01:21:38.741
is these like classic Hollywood
gloves and the grandma pearls


1782
01:21:38.743 --> 01:21:40.744
..I don't... it's just a little,

1783
01:21:40.746 --> 01:21:43.781
I don't know how to wrap my
head around that.


1784
01:21:43.783 --> 01:21:46.349
We're doing a pop music
video and that's really


1785
01:21:46.351 --> 01:21:50.053
throwing me off. But that
can be adjusted.


1786
01:21:50.055 --> 01:21:53.122
Uhm, overall, I really
liked the dance.


1787
01:21:53.124 --> 01:21:54.323
What'd you think, Alison?

1788
01:21:54.325 --> 01:21:57.193
I have to kind of piggy-back
on what Devon was saying.


1789
01:21:57.195 --> 01:22:00.696
So as a dancer, I really
appreciated the precision,


1790
01:22:00.698 --> 01:22:03.067
uhm, I saw some ripples
and some cannons,


1791
01:22:03.069 --> 01:22:06.769
and the choreography
was so technical


1792
01:22:06.771 --> 01:22:10.640
it kind of almost reminded me of
like, synchronized swimming.


1793
01:22:10.642 --> 01:22:12.776
Uh, so I don't know if that's
what we're going for,


1794
01:22:12.778 --> 01:22:15.512
I don't know if that's relevant
to a pop music video,


1795
01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:19.083
but you all are clearly
talented and uhm,


1796
01:22:19.085 --> 01:22:20.851
if you're not using
those pearls later,


1797
01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:26.356
I could wear them at some point,
so holla at your girl.


1798
01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:27.027
Dex?

1799
01:22:28.028 --> 01:22:29.660
Yeah, I mean, I think
you guys were so good,


1800
01:22:29.662 --> 01:22:32.095
like really really good, really
really technical


1801
01:22:32.097 --> 01:22:34.164
but maybe you guys were a
little too in sync.


1802
01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:37.433
Uhm, I think when doing this,
you know we definitely


1803
01:22:37.435 --> 01:22:41.104
wanna find somebody or a team
with individuality and I think


1804
01:22:41.106 --> 01:22:43.139
you guys were giving me a
little bit too all of one thing.


1805
01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:47.143
But that has nothing to do with
how great your fuetes were,


1806
01:22:47.145 --> 01:22:48.745
your turns, and everything
was so on point,


1807
01:22:48.747 --> 01:22:51.482
but maybe it was a little too
much for what we're looking for.


1808
01:22:51.484 --> 01:22:52.883
But, uhm, you guys were great.

1809
01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.351
Great job judges.

1810
01:22:54.353 --> 01:22:56.519

Jillian and her team!

01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:38.415
That was out of this world.

1864
01:25:38.417 --> 01:25:39.950
Let's see what the
judges have to say!


1865
01:25:39.952 --> 01:25:42.052
Alright! Nice job girls!

1866
01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.787
Avery, you obviously got
a lot of fans back here,


1867
01:25:44.789 --> 01:25:47.857
your mom was going crazy.
That was really cool. I get it.


1868
01:25:47.859 --> 01:25:50.594
I get why they love you.
What I wanna say though


1869
01:25:50.596 --> 01:25:54.298
is you're obviously the leader
of the team, and that's awesome,


1870
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:59.936
but uhm, sometimes being a
great leader means giving


1871
01:25:59.938 --> 01:26:03.572
other people the opportunity to
shine and giving other people


1872
01:26:03.574 --> 01:26:06.742
the opportunity to step up and
become leaders themselves.


1873
01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:10.379
Uh, so I just want you to think
about that moving forward,


1874
01:26:10.381 --> 01:26:13.650
but overall nice job ladies.
How'd you feel Alyson?


1875
01:26:13.652 --> 01:26:17.920
(laughs) Well, 
I noticed that

1876
01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:21.758
one of you forgot
your black jazz pants.


1877
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.463
And, uhm, that's great that you
know how to stand out,


1878
01:26:26.465 --> 01:26:29.732
but if you're trying to support
an artist I need to know that


1879
01:26:29.734 --> 01:26:33.836
you know how to make him look
good and-and work together


1880
01:26:33.838 --> 01:26:37.406
together around him so, I just
felt like I didn't get to know


1881
01:26:37.408 --> 01:26:39.343
anyone else besides you Avery.

1882
01:26:39.345 --> 01:26:41.077
And clearly you all are really
great at what you do,


1883
01:26:41.079 --> 01:26:43.813
so, uhm, that's how I feel.
What about you?


1884
01:26:43.815 --> 01:26:46.083
Yeah I don't know if we can
use a princess with our pop


1885
01:26:46.085 --> 01:26:50.086
star. It seems like you were
good but I didn't really get the


1886
01:26:50.088 --> 01:26:52.888
opportunity to tell about how
your team was and that's


1887
01:26:52.890 --> 01:26:55.092
important for what we need
to work with Chris,


1888
01:26:55.094 --> 01:26:59.629
and so uhm, I mean it was great,
but I just don't know.


1889
01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:03.733
Okay girls, eyes on me.
This is it. Okay?


1890
01:27:03.735 --> 01:27:06.469
Don't lose focus and don't
hold back.


1891
01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:10.506
You have no second chance, okay?
Remember that, okay?


1892
01:27:10.508 --> 01:27:14.378
I know you can do it, and I know
you know you can do it.


1893
01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:18.147
So now let's go show all of them
how you do it. Okay?


1894
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:20.452
Break legs, do so good!
(blows kiss)


1895
01:27:21.787 --> 01:27:24.086
All right let's give
a final thank you


1896
01:27:24.088 --> 01:27:27.456
to Avery Adams and her team.
Let's hear it!


1897
01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:28.357
(audience cheers)

1898
01:27:28.359 --> 01:27:31.961
Thank you. Thank you, Avery.
All right.


1899
01:27:31.963 --> 01:27:33.662
All right, it's your turn,
you're up.


1900
01:27:33.664 --> 01:27:36.133
Win this. I'm rootin for ya.

1901
01:27:36.135 --> 01:27:40.536
Our last team to perform is
led by Mackie Castillo.


1902
01:27:40.538 --> 01:27:42.973
Please show them some love and
welcome to the stage!


1903
01:27:42.975 --> 01:27:44.040
Here's Mackie!

1904

That was the most amazing
dance combination


1946
01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:20.796
Really, out of this world
spectacular.


1947
01:30:20.798 --> 01:30:23.133
And I know you all loved it,
right? Right?


1948
01:30:23.135 --> 01:30:25.067
(audience cheers)

1949
01:30:25.069 --> 01:30:26.702
All right, let's hear it from
the judges.


1950
01:30:26.704 --> 01:30:31.974
Yeah! We're having fun now
girls! That was awesome!


1951
01:30:31.976 --> 01:30:36.345
I just wanna say, I just had a
blast. I was dancing in my seat.


1952
01:30:36.347 --> 01:30:38.348
I was over here just
singin' for you guys,


1953
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:41.017
snappin', clappin', tappin'.

1954
01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:44.888
Uh, all of it, uhm, and
that's, that's awesome.


1955
01:30:44.890 --> 01:30:47.723
We're, we're gonna make a pop
music video and that's


1956
01:30:47.725 --> 01:30:51.795
ultimately what I wanna feel
with the dance is that, uh


1957
01:30:51.797 --> 01:30:53.996
I'm
-I'm feelin good, ya know?

1958
01:30:53.998 --> 01:30:57.032
I can tell that there's a lot of
love on this team


1959
01:30:57.034 --> 01:30:59.201
and that's awesome.

1960
01:30:59.203 --> 01:31:01.737
I liked your guys
huddle choreography,


1961
01:31:01.739 --> 01:31:04.741
you did that a couple times,
team meeting, okay break...


1962
01:31:04.743 --> 01:31:06.009
we're on this!

1963
01:31:06.011 --> 01:31:09.045
Uh, I like the secret handshake
you two threw out at the end.


1964
01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:12.648
Uhm yeah, I feel really good
watching you guys.


1965
01:31:12.650 --> 01:31:13.650
You're a great team.

1966
01:31:13.652 --> 01:31:16.952
It feels like family. Nice work.

1967
01:31:16.954 --> 01:31:20.156
Have any of you known
each other for a long time?


1968
01:31:20.158 --> 01:31:23.093
Uh, uh, we're actually
sisters.


1969
01:31:23.095 --> 01:31:26.095
Okay, yes. That makes sense
because I could see


1970
01:31:26.097 --> 01:31:29.098
the communication on stage.
You're making eye contact,


1971
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.735
you're working with each
other and it feels like


1972
01:31:31.737 --> 01:31:32.936
you're telling a story.

1973
01:31:32.938 --> 01:31:35.804
You know you started on the
ground and you let it build


1974
01:31:35.806 --> 01:31:38.708
and escalate into more, you
know, precise choreography.


1975
01:31:38.710 --> 01:31:43.079
And that's something that
you can't, you can't fake.


1976
01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:47.317
You can't fake the feeling and
if you can convince the audience


1977
01:31:47.319 --> 01:31:49.652
you're having a good time, that
invites them to do the same


1978
01:31:49.654 --> 01:31:52.421
thing. And that's a win-win
in my book.


1979
01:31:52.423 --> 01:31:54.057
(sing-songy) Dexter?

1980
01:31:54.059 --> 01:31:55.692
Yeah, I love your
guys' look too.


1981
01:31:55.694 --> 01:31:58.894
The jackets... and it's so
festive and so fun.


1982
01:31:58.896 --> 01:32:01.031
I also want to give a
special shout out to you


1983
01:32:01.033 --> 01:32:02.432
in your tap shoes.

1984
01:32:02.434 --> 01:32:06.335
Um, as a tapper it's not easy
to do what you just did


1985
01:32:06.337 --> 01:32:08.671
with all those choreographies
in your tap shoes.


1986
01:32:08.673 --> 01:32:10.706
So I just want to
definitely applaud you.


1987
01:32:10.708 --> 01:32:13.410
But, and also, your guys'
supporting team?


1988
01:32:13.412 --> 01:32:15.277
I wanna party
with all y'all.


1989
01:32:15.279 --> 01:32:17.312
Like y'all seem like you have
such a great time and that's...


1990
01:32:17.314 --> 01:32:20.784
yeah, yeah, give it up.
That was awesome.


1991
01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:24.720
You guys look like you have so
much fun and um, you know,


1992
01:32:24.722 --> 01:32:25.789
and you're such a great team.

1993
01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:29.092
And the judges and Chris,
you know, we really like


1994
01:32:29.094 --> 01:32:30.460
that team effort, because
that's what we are.


1995
01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:31.960
And so that's kind of what
we're looking for.


1996
01:32:31.962 --> 01:32:34.164
But you guys did an
incredible job.


1997
01:32:34.166 --> 01:32:36.765
Alright, that's definitely
some good stuff!


1998
01:32:36.767 --> 01:32:39.001
Let's hear it again for
Mackie and her team!


1999
01:32:39.003 --> 01:32:40.036
(audience cheers)

2000
01:32:40.038 --> 01:32:42.774
Thanks you guys! Thank you,
thank you so much.


2001
01:32:44.275 --> 01:32:47.376
Okay, while the scores
are being tabulated,


2002
01:32:47.378 --> 01:32:49.245
we have a big
surprise for ya!


2003
01:32:49.247 --> 01:32:51.281
- Let's compare notes, okay?
- A very special video message


2004
01:32:51.283 --> 01:32:52.448
from none other than the

2005
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:54.183
- pop sensation himself,
- I don't know.


2006
01:32:54.185 --> 01:32:56.219
