- Sparkling cranberry.
- Oh!


6
00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:29.281
Sparkling cranberry.

7
00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.580
Thank you.

8
00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.214
And this is for you.

9
00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:39.847
And then this
one is for her.


10
00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:41.147
Oh!

11
00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:47.924
Oh.

12
00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.514
Uhh.

13
00:00:57.428 --> 00:00:58.692
You.

14
00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:01.347
What are these?

15
00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:05.343
Oh. Uh, eclairs
with icing sugar?


16
00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:07.061
I wouldn't feed
these to my dogs.


17
00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:08.647
That's probably wise

18
00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.247
even without
the extra frosting.


19
00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:15.247
Paige Monaghan
events exemplify two things:


20
00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:16.980
class and elegance.

21
00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:18.947
These resemble neither.

22
00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:20.947
Get rid of them
immediately.


23
00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:23.314
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't
catch your name.


24
00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.147
Paige Monaghan.

25
00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:27.656
Oh! Ms. Monaghan,

26
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:29.314
it is an honor
to meet you.


27
00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.247
I've... I've only worked
with you for a few months.


28
00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:33.346
I'm... I'm
Brooke Bennett.


29
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:35.247
I'm not interested
at the moment.


30
00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:36.780
And find some shoes.

31
00:01:37.782 --> 00:01:38.747
Of course.

32
00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:50.190
Oh, you want space?
Question mark?


33
00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.054
Well, we're done.
How's that for space?


34
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.114
Question mark, question
mark, angry face!


35
00:01:55.483 --> 00:01:56.980
Cable company again?

36
00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.847
Derek has decided to
spend the holidays


37
00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:00.913
in Colorado
with his friends


38
00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:02.813
and didn't think it
was worth mentioning to me


39
00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:04.080
before booking the flights!

40
00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:05.314
- Ugh.
- I'm done.


41
00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.072
- We're done. It's over.
- I'm sorry.


42
00:02:07.097 --> 00:02:08.881
- What's with those?
- Well, apparently, they don't


43
00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:12.014
meet Ms. Monaghan's standards
of elegance and class.


44
00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.247
- Oh. Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.


45
00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:15.797
Well, maybe I
should be the judge.


46
00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:17.447
Uh, Margot...

47
00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:18.780
Elegant.

48
00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:20.114
Classy.

49
00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:21.580
- Elegant and classy.
- No.


50
00:02:21.615 --> 00:02:23.347
Paige Monaghan
wouldn't know class


51
00:02:23.383 --> 00:02:24.749
- if it jumped out of a cake.
- Shh.


52
00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.931
In fact, she can take
these eclairs and...


53
00:02:26.956 --> 00:02:28.281
And what?

54
00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:29.580
Question mark.

55
00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:33.514
Ms. Monaghan.

56
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.852
Ah! Ah!

57
00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:40.513
Whatever. That
job stunk, anyway.


58
00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:42.706
- Yeah. Who needs it?
- Yeah.


59
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:44.780
Well, we
kind of did.


60
00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:47.147
She didn't fire both of us. You
know, you could have stayed.


61
00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:48.813
And what, abandon
my sister,


62
00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.247
at Christmas? Never.

63
00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:52.980
You know what? Maybe
it's a good thing.


64
00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:56.114
Maybe now, we finally start
our own event planning company.


65
00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.947
Right? I mean, we've
talked about it for years,


66
00:02:57.982 --> 00:03:00.369
and plus, we're a million
times better than that hack.


67
00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:01.704
- Oh, total hack.
- Yeah.


68
00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.069
You know what? Hack central,
mayor of Hackstown, USA!


69
00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:06.317
Exactly!

70
00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:07.446
We'll figure it out.

71
00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:09.980
We always do.

72
00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.114
Sorry. Just, it's
part of the uniform.


73
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.014
We got to get
that deposit back.


74
00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:26.980
Is this it?

75
00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:28.480
I mean, is this all?

76
00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:29.872
Well, there's another
thing of kung pow,


77
00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.513
but I was kind of saving
it for breakfast.


78
00:03:31.548 --> 00:03:33.281
No. I mean life.

79
00:03:33.316 --> 00:03:34.513
There's got to
be more to life.


80
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.801
There's got to be
more than this.


81
00:03:36.826 --> 00:03:37.980
I'm sick of
getting stepped on


82
00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:39.565
by the Paige Monaghans
of the world.


83
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.694
Right, and the
Dereks of the world.


84
00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.077
Dans of the world.

85
00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.511
He didn't deserve
you, Brooke.


86
00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:48.057
The divorce was not...

87
00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:50.281
You're right.
It's okay.


88
00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:51.880
We both deserve better.

89
00:03:53.615 --> 00:03:56.142
Look at us.
Partner-less.


90
00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.889
Family-less. Now,
we're jobless.


91
00:03:58.914 --> 00:04:00.747
Well, maybe it's a
gift, you know.


92
00:04:00.772 --> 00:04:02.355
Like, sometimes,
it takes hitting bottom


93
00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.813
to find your
way back to the top.


94
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.913
You know, the money Dad
left us was for a rainy day,


95
00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:10.147
and right now, it's a
bit of a downpour.


96
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:12.780
You know what we do?

97
00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.941
We go to Ireland, like,
tomorrow.


98
00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.215
Why would we
go to Ireland?


99
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.915
Why wouldn't we go?

100
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.024
I mean, if Dad had
been healthy enough to travel


101
00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.571
when he discovered
his Irish roots,


102
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.513
he would have given anything
track down his relatives.


103
00:04:25.548 --> 00:04:27.147
Our relatives.

104
00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:28.880
We've got family
over there, Brooke.


105
00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.281
Think about that.

106
00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:34.546
How did we
lose them both?


107
00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:40.980
You know what?

108
00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:42.913
You're right.

109
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.647
You're right. Let's
do it. Let's go.


110
00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:46.180
Yeah? Really?

111
00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:49.123
Yes. Yes. Maybe it is time
to just shake the tree.


112
00:04:49.148 --> 00:04:52.258
Yes! Yes! Oh,
my gosh! Yes!


113
00:04:52.283 --> 00:04:53.946
Oh, but if you get us
thrown into an Irish prison,


114
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:55.247
I'm not going to be happy.

115
00:05:09.447 --> 00:05:10.757
We need
to find a pub.


116
00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:13.313
What? It's barely noon. I
mean, even Aunt Lydia


117
00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:15.180
waited 'til three to
start cracking ciders.


118
00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:16.980
If we're serious about
tracking down our relatives,


119
00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:18.747
it's the logical place
to start.


120
00:05:20.448 --> 00:05:21.647
I mean, this isn't <i>Cheers</i>

121
00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:23.446
where everybody just
knows your name.


122
00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:25.913
- It's Ireland.
- Exactly.


123
00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.692
Exactly what? You
have to make a point


124
00:05:27.717 --> 00:05:28.780
before you
say "exactly."


125
00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:30.080
Exactly. Pub.

126
00:05:30.116 --> 00:05:31.114
I'll even let you pick.

127
00:06:11.116 --> 00:06:14.246
Fionn! You look
like you've seen a ghost.


128
00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:15.913
Of course not, my lord.

129
00:06:15.938 --> 00:06:16.947
I wasn't expecting...

130
00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:18.647
I was only
teasing you.


131
00:06:18.682 --> 00:06:21.480
Happy to see you, my friend.

132
00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.690
Does Siobhan know of
your arrival?


133
00:06:23.715 --> 00:06:25.947
Well, if it isn't
the Earl of Glaslough


134
00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:27.680
gracing us with
his glorious presence.


135
00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:29.590
If I had to wager...

136
00:06:29.615 --> 00:06:31.446
Siobhan.

137
00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:35.513
You look...
you look well,


138
00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:38.313
and the renovations
are... stunning.


139
00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:40.813
I'll let the staff
know the earl approves.


140
00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.647
Uh, to what do
we owe the pleasure?


141
00:06:42.682 --> 00:06:44.313
I thought you were designing
a building in Italy.


142
00:06:44.348 --> 00:06:46.580
I was, but the project,
uh, hit a bump,


143
00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:49.147
so I thought I'd come
home for Christmas.


144
00:06:49.182 --> 00:06:51.323
Dear brother, we
both know


145
00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:54.780
it's neither honor nor sense of
duty that brings you here,


146
00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.813
and it's certainly
not Christmas,


147
00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.147
so, what
is it really?


148
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.423
I've also come to address

149
00:07:01.448 --> 00:07:03.446
the castle's
current financial situation.


150
00:07:03.482 --> 00:07:06.813
I see. So you've come to
play hero and save the day.


151
00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:08.313
- Siobhan...
- And then what?


152
00:07:08.348 --> 00:07:10.147
Ride off into the
sunset again?


153
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:11.605
Well, don't expect me

154
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.947
to be thanking you
for it any time soon.


155
00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:16.920
Your quarters are as
you left them.


156
00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:19.313
Uh, but you'll want
a broom.


157
00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:22.513
There's about five years' worth
of dust to be dealt with.


158
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:37.146
Oh. The Earl of Glaslough
gracing us with his presence.


159
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:38.647
It's a Christmas
miracle.


160
00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:41.413
Let me help you
with those, Clara.


161
00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:43.721
And, uh, Aiden,

162
00:07:43.746 --> 00:07:45.047
not Earl, hmm?

163
00:07:48.548 --> 00:07:49.671
Have you been
to see Siobhan yet?


164
00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:51.029
I have.

165
00:07:51.054 --> 00:07:52.573
- Was she...
- Happy to see me?


166
00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:54.907
Over the moon.

167
00:07:54.932 --> 00:07:59.246
Aiden, I've known the two
of you since you were kids.


168
00:07:59.282 --> 00:08:00.557
Siobhan loves you.

169
00:08:00.582 --> 00:08:03.114
She's missed you.
We all have.


170
00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.747
Oh, I'm not so
sure about that,


171
00:08:04.782 --> 00:08:08.089
but I'm happy to see all
of you and this place.


172
00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:09.212
It's been too long.

173
00:08:09.237 --> 00:08:10.647
Catch me up over a pint.

174
00:08:10.682 --> 00:08:12.513
I suppose there's time for
one on the house.


175
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:14.813
We haven't missed you
that much.


176
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:17.446
Ah, good man.

177
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.280
Oh, this one is
so cute.


178
00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:28.947
I pick this one.

179
00:08:28.982 --> 00:08:30.030
Yay! Great! Come on!

180
00:08:30.055 --> 00:08:31.380
Let's go.

181
00:08:36.413 --> 00:08:37.747
I love this place.

182
00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:39.190
It is so...

183
00:08:39.215 --> 00:08:40.513
Irish.

184
00:08:42.448 --> 00:08:44.780
Welcome to Lanighan's, ladies.
What can I get for you?


185
00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:46.247
Uh, do you have
a drink menu?


186
00:08:46.272 --> 00:08:49.780
Beer, whiskey,
or beer and whiskey.


187
00:08:49.815 --> 00:08:51.014
Uh...

188
00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:52.475
- Beer.
- Whiskey.


189
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.680
Please. I can't
believe we're here.


190
00:08:54.715 --> 00:08:56.079
- I know.
- I feel like we've stepped


191
00:08:56.115 --> 00:08:58.368
- into a movie or something.
- Yeah.


192
00:08:58.393 --> 00:08:59.647
We're not from
around here.


193
00:08:59.682 --> 00:09:00.913
You don't say.

194
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:02.090
Uh, we're from New York.

195
00:09:02.115 --> 00:09:04.370
We're event planners.

196
00:09:04.395 --> 00:09:06.780
Um, yeah. We've had a
little time off,


197
00:09:06.815 --> 00:09:08.576
so we've actually come
to Ireland to look for...


198
00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:10.135
Leprechauns?

199
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.624
Um, excuse me?

200
00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:13.414
Uh, if it's leprechauns
you're after,


201
00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:15.079
there's a rainbow
at the end of the street


202
00:09:15.107 --> 00:09:16.690
- filled with a pot of gold.
- Oh.


203
00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:18.580
Now, if you spot
one of those little devils,


204
00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:20.847
don't get too close.
They're a wee bit bite-y


205
00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:22.647
- this time of year.
- Don't mind him.


206
00:09:22.682 --> 00:09:25.280
He's a wee bit bite-y
himself today.


207
00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:27.113
What was it you girls
were looking for?


208
00:09:27.148 --> 00:09:28.624
Well, before our
father passed away,


209
00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.156
we unsealed his
adoption records,


210
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:31.747
and it turns out his
birth parents


211
00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:33.245
were both born
in Ireland.


212
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.815
Yeah. We're looking for
our relatives.


213
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.829
Yeah. All we know about them is,
their last name is O'Reilly.


214
00:09:37.854 --> 00:09:39.405
I'm an O'Reilly.

215
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.818
- Really?
- Oh.


216
00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:42.792
And so is he.

217
00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:44.980
In fact... O'Reilly!

218
00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:46.640
Yeah?

219
00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:48.580
You've certainly come to
the right part of Ireland,


220
00:09:48.615 --> 00:09:51.198
but I'm afraid you might be
searching for an O'Reilly


221
00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:53.039
- in a haystack.
- Oh.


222
00:09:53.064 --> 00:09:55.446
But if you're looking
to pass the time,


223
00:09:55.482 --> 00:09:57.426
Castle Hart is
just down the way,


224
00:09:57.451 --> 00:10:00.847
and they give tours
every hour on the hour.


225
00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:02.226
Isn't that right?

226
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:04.489
Yep, but there's a
dragon in that castle,


227
00:10:04.514 --> 00:10:05.813
and she really
does bite.


228
00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:11.209
- Event planners? Really?
- Oh, I was hardly going to say


229
00:10:11.234 --> 00:10:13.182
"unemployed waitresses from
New York," was I?


230
00:10:13.207 --> 00:10:14.290
Plus, we're on vacation.

231
00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:15.513
We can be
whoever we want.


232
00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:16.712
You're right, and
you know what?


233
00:10:16.737 --> 00:10:18.990
Let's start with
happy and employed.


234
00:10:19.015 --> 00:10:20.480
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.


235
00:10:21.979 --> 00:10:24.974
Although Castle Hart
was built in the 1870s,


236
00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:28.647
the estate dates all the
way back to 1633.


237
00:10:28.682 --> 00:10:31.079
The earl-ship,
granted centuries ago,


238
00:10:31.104 --> 00:10:32.913
originated with
Charles Hart.


239
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:34.176
If this doesn't pick up a bit,

240
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:35.460
I'm scaling the wall.

241
00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:37.480
Yeah. I might have
to go with you.


242
00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:41.278
I mean, earl-ship, lordship,
spaceship. Who cares?


243
00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:42.828
Oh, you know what we should do?
We should go check out


244
00:10:42.853 --> 00:10:44.357
that Christmas market
we saw on the way here.


245
00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:45.661
- Oh, yes.
- Right?


246
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:47.049
How do we... Just...

247
00:10:47.074 --> 00:10:48.939
Just, like, go.

248
00:10:48.963 --> 00:10:51.113
And she enjoyed
helping the peasants...


249
00:10:52.148 --> 00:10:53.680
See, now,
this is fun.


250
00:10:53.715 --> 00:10:56.609
This is how our ancestors
celebrated Christmas.


251
00:10:56.634 --> 00:10:58.382
I feel more Irish
already.


252
00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.146
If you start Riverdance-ing,
you're on your own.


253
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:03.572
If I start Riverdance-ing,
I won't be on my own for long.


254
00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:05.179
Aw.

255
00:11:05.204 --> 00:11:06.851
I need to find
the ladies' room.


256
00:11:06.876 --> 00:11:08.357
Really? I'll
be here.


257
00:11:08.382 --> 00:11:10.589
- Okay.
- May I get these, please?


258
00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:12.280
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.


259
00:11:14.948 --> 00:11:16.308
- Okay.
- I think, uh,


260
00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:18.413
Santa Claus is
that way.


261
00:11:18.448 --> 00:11:20.590
- Hi.
- Hi.


262
00:11:20.615 --> 00:11:22.946
Yeah. You know what?
We don't have Santa Claus


263
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:25.079
in America. No. It's
just a little elf


264
00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:27.146
who drives around in
a pickup truck.


265
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:29.780
He looks like Abraham Lincoln,
and he hands out apple pies.


266
00:11:29.815 --> 00:11:32.113
Oh. Sounds like it
might be worth a visit.


267
00:11:33.548 --> 00:11:35.523
- How was your tour?
- Uh, it was short.


268
00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:36.711
I mean, the castle
is so beautiful,


269
00:11:36.736 --> 00:11:39.090
but the whole earls
and lords thing,


270
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.446
- I don't know.
- Care to elaborate?


271
00:11:41.482 --> 00:11:43.711
Well, I get that it's a huge
part of European history,


272
00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:46.246
but it's just so
un-relatable, you know?


273
00:11:46.282 --> 00:11:47.693
"I'm
the Earl of such and such,


274
00:11:47.718 --> 00:11:49.480
and I have a castle."

275
00:11:49.515 --> 00:11:50.960
An earl that sounds
like the Queen?


276
00:11:50.985 --> 00:11:53.680
Yeah. It just feels
a little out of touch.


277
00:11:53.705 --> 00:11:57.415
Mm. Well, it's not just
baseless posturing.


278
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.747
I mean, historically,
the earl


279
00:11:58.775 --> 00:12:00.047
was the governing
body for the people,


280
00:12:00.072 --> 00:12:02.113
and it was a title held
with great reverence.


281
00:12:02.148 --> 00:12:03.847
And nowadays?

282
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:05.680
I tell you what.

283
00:12:05.715 --> 00:12:07.079
I have some connections
at the castle,


284
00:12:07.115 --> 00:12:08.601
and if you're interested,
I could arrange


285
00:12:08.626 --> 00:12:11.159
for a private tour, see if I
can't change your mind.


286
00:12:11.184 --> 00:12:13.976
What now? Directions to a
field of four-leaf clovers?


287
00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:16.810
He's offering us a private
tour of the castle.


288
00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:17.872
Oh, is he now?

289
00:12:17.897 --> 00:12:19.280
Yeah, for
the both of you.


290
00:12:19.315 --> 00:12:21.688
Mm-hmm.

291
00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:22.680
If you're interested,

292
00:12:22.715 --> 00:12:24.090
meet me at
the castle at nine


293
00:12:24.115 --> 00:12:25.590
and ask for my
name at the door.


294
00:12:25.615 --> 00:12:26.808
Which is...

295
00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:28.079
Aiden Hart.

296
00:12:37.315 --> 00:12:39.946
I can't believe we agreed
to a tour with Leprechaun Guy.


297
00:12:39.981 --> 00:12:42.187
It could be interesting,
and we'll give it five minutes.


298
00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:44.748
If it seems dodgy,
we'll bail.


299
00:12:44.773 --> 00:12:46.079
Ah, good morning.

300
00:12:46.115 --> 00:12:47.979
We're guests of
Mr. Hart.


301
00:12:48.015 --> 00:12:50.695
Indeed. Right this way.

302
00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.446
Five years I've been struggling
to keep this estate afloat


303
00:12:56.482 --> 00:12:58.647
while you've been off
traveling the globe


304
00:12:58.682 --> 00:13:01.246
playing architect
to the stars.


305
00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:04.357
Five years I've been bearing
the burden of this castle


306
00:13:04.382 --> 00:13:07.246
in your name,
the Earl of Glaslough.


307
00:13:07.282 --> 00:13:09.457
That title was important
to Dad. I never wanted it.


308
00:13:09.482 --> 00:13:12.156
And I never wanted to
find myself on the brink


309
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:13.956
of having our
family's legacy


310
00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:16.013
fall into the hands
of a greedy bank,


311
00:13:16.048 --> 00:13:18.697
but... here we are.

312
00:13:18.722 --> 00:13:19.946
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:21.282 --> 00:13:23.246
Truly.

314
00:13:23.282 --> 00:13:25.424
But look.
I'm here now.


315
00:13:25.449 --> 00:13:26.713
Let me help.

316
00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:30.903
After the news I
received this morning,


317
00:13:30.928 --> 00:13:32.198
it's a little late
for that,


318
00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:34.229
I'm afraid.

319
00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:36.946
Siobhan, please.
What's going on?


320
00:13:41.948 --> 00:13:43.929
What? I have to go.

321
00:13:43.954 --> 00:13:45.195
Why didn't you
go earlier?


322
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.912
Well, because earlier,
I was at a two,


323
00:13:46.948 --> 00:13:49.912
and now, I'm... I'm a 12
out of a possible 10.


324
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:53.680
- What... what are you doing?
- Find a restroom.


325
00:13:53.715 --> 00:13:55.113
There must be, like,

326
00:13:55.148 --> 00:13:56.238
There's probably
one up here.


327
00:13:56.263 --> 00:13:57.812
- Margot, I...
- Don't worry.


328
00:13:57.848 --> 00:13:59.079
...don't think we're
allowed to just...


329
00:13:59.115 --> 00:14:00.680
- Come on.
- Wander around.


330
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.513
O'Sullivan just
up and quit?


331
00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:03.979
Well, citing what
reason?


332
00:14:04.015 --> 00:14:05.647
Overextended,
apparently.


333
00:14:05.682 --> 00:14:07.288
He hadn't arranged
a single thing.


334
00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.846
No band, no caterers,
no decorations.


335
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:11.677
All he'd done is
send out invitations


336
00:14:11.702 --> 00:14:13.860
to a party
that doesn't exist.


337
00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:15.384
Well, have you tried
searching for...


338
00:14:15.409 --> 00:14:17.146
A replacement?
Of course.


339
00:14:17.181 --> 00:14:19.446
Everyone is booked,

340
00:14:19.482 --> 00:14:21.113
along with everything
else in this town.


341
00:14:22.416 --> 00:14:24.554
Aiden. Hi.

342
00:14:24.579 --> 00:14:25.979
Uh, you said nine.

343
00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:27.313
We... we aren't
snooping.


344
00:14:27.348 --> 00:14:29.797
We need a restroom.
She's at a 12.


345
00:14:29.822 --> 00:14:30.946
Oh, uh,
of course.


346
00:14:30.981 --> 00:14:32.846
Uh, down the hall,
two lefts,


347
00:14:32.881 --> 00:14:34.580
then another left,
then a right.


348
00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:35.879
- Can't miss it.
- Thanks.


349
00:14:37.282 --> 00:14:39.508
Uh, Siobhan,
this is...


350
00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:40.646
I didn't even
get your names.


351
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.269
Oh. I'm Margot.

352
00:14:42.294 --> 00:14:43.413
- Margot.
- Yeah.


353
00:14:43.448 --> 00:14:44.829
Yeah. We, uh, met
yesterday,


354
00:14:44.854 --> 00:14:46.257
and I promised them
a private tour.


355
00:14:46.282 --> 00:14:47.680
They're vacationing
from New York.


356
00:14:47.714 --> 00:14:49.613
They're, um...

357
00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:51.979
Did you say you
do event planning?


358
00:14:52.004 --> 00:14:54.070
Uh... yeah.
I did say that.


359
00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:55.311
What sort of events?

360
00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:57.146
Oh, you know,
the usual.


361
00:14:57.181 --> 00:14:59.823
Uh, weddings,
inaugurations, quinceañeras,


362
00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:03.029
all the fancy ones.
Big and fancy.


363
00:15:03.054 --> 00:15:04.405
Uh, but I'm
just logistics.


364
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.079
My sister's the creative one.
It's her company, so...


365
00:15:07.104 --> 00:15:09.979
Um, so, what's the heating bill
like in a place like this?


366
00:15:10.004 --> 00:15:11.585
Woof!

367
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.766
I know this might be
a horrible imposition,


368
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:17.663
but I find myself in quite
a bind at the moment.


369
00:15:17.687 --> 00:15:21.090
We host an annual Christmas gala
for the Duchess of Abercorn,


370
00:15:21.115 --> 00:15:23.283
and the gentleman
in charge of planning it


371
00:15:23.308 --> 00:15:25.716
has unceremoniously
quit.


372
00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:28.647
We're in dire need of
a replacement.


373
00:15:29.893 --> 00:15:32.826
And... you're
asking us?


374
00:15:32.851 --> 00:15:35.812
We'll pay your full fee and
then some for the inconvenience,


375
00:15:35.848 --> 00:15:39.213
and you're welcome to stay
in the castle for sake of ease.


376
00:15:40.352 --> 00:15:41.625
This gala is...

377
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.423
Of great importance.

378
00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:47.647
Oh. Well, um, I'll just need
to check with my sister,


379
00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:51.222
but, um, really,
we'd be delighted.


380
00:15:51.247 --> 00:15:52.777
Brilliant.
You're sure?


381
00:15:52.802 --> 00:15:54.182
Oh, oh, yeah.
Definitely. Yes.


382
00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:56.513
Oh, I can't tell you
what a relief this is.


383
00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:59.121
Oh.

384
00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:02.179
What's your company? I'd love
to take a look at your website,


385
00:16:02.215 --> 00:16:03.879
see some
previous events.


386
00:16:10.064 --> 00:16:11.812
Oh. There you are.

387
00:16:11.848 --> 00:16:13.746
I got so lost I
almost ended up in Scotland.


388
00:16:13.781 --> 00:16:15.923
Okay. Here's the thing.
I did something big,


389
00:16:15.948 --> 00:16:17.198
something amazing for us.

390
00:16:17.223 --> 00:16:18.946
- Margot, what are you talking about?
- Look. I'll explain later.


391
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:20.846
I just need you to play along,
okay? This could change


392
00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:22.846
- our lives forev...
- Ladies!


393
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.846
Again, I can't
thank you enough


394
00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:26.113
for coming on board
at such short notice.


395
00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:27.846
Oh.

396
00:16:27.881 --> 00:16:32.013
Turning the family castle into
a hotel was a huge gamble.


397
00:16:32.048 --> 00:16:33.471
Now, five years in,

398
00:16:33.496 --> 00:16:35.423
to see it all
at risk...


399
00:16:35.448 --> 00:16:38.946
Your help at this point
is everything.


400
00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:41.856
Assuming you're
both in agreement?


401
00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:43.679
- Uh...
- We discussed it,


402
00:16:43.714 --> 00:16:45.823
and we're
incredibly excited.


403
00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:48.423
- Can't wait to find out more.
- Yeah.


404
00:16:48.448 --> 00:16:50.123
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.


405
00:16:50.148 --> 00:16:53.789
Uh, here is a folio with all
the pertinent information


406
00:16:53.814 --> 00:16:56.323
for planning the gala, and
if you need anything at all,


407
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:58.912
you have, round the
clock at your disposal,


408
00:16:58.948 --> 00:17:00.579
the Earl
of Glaslough.


409
00:17:03.635 --> 00:17:07.655
It's truly an honor to
be working with you, Paige.


410
00:17:10.115 --> 00:17:13.146
Or would you prefer
Ms. Monaghan?


411
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:19.519
I cannot believe you
told them I'm Paige Monaghan!


412
00:17:19.544 --> 00:17:21.357
All I said was,
it's your company!


413
00:17:21.382 --> 00:17:23.326
It's called
Paige Monaghan Events!


414
00:17:23.351 --> 00:17:25.222
It's unlikely it's named
after the family pet.


415
00:17:25.247 --> 00:17:26.541
Do you remember that
whole part where I said


416
00:17:26.565 --> 00:17:27.689
we can't get
thrown in prison?


417
00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.179
No. It's not like
it's illegal.


418
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.367
It's highly unethical.

419
00:17:30.392 --> 00:17:33.313
No, it's not
unethical! It's...


420
00:17:33.348 --> 00:17:34.979
Okay. Alright. Yeah. It's
a tiny bit unethical,


421
00:17:35.015 --> 00:17:36.704
- but Brooke, hear me out.
- No. You have to go


422
00:17:36.729 --> 00:17:38.156
back in there and
tell them the truth!


423
00:17:38.181 --> 00:17:39.246
- Brooke!
- Margot!


424
00:17:39.282 --> 00:17:40.280
- Brooke!
- Margot!


425
00:17:40.315 --> 00:17:42.046
Brooke?

426
00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:45.280
- Thank you.
- Oh.


427
00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:48.179
I'm sorry I lied, but
you heard Siobhan.


428
00:17:48.204 --> 00:17:50.313
Their event planner quit,
and if this gala doesn't happen,


429
00:17:50.348 --> 00:17:52.113
it could ruin them. The
duchess has ties


430
00:17:52.148 --> 00:17:53.812
to all of Ireland's
high society.


431
00:17:53.848 --> 00:17:56.446
If this relationship goes
south, so does the business.


432
00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:58.050
They need our help.
They need your help.


433
00:17:58.075 --> 00:18:00.446
No, they need Paige
Monaghan's help. I'm not...


434
00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:03.480
No! You're a million
times better, and nicer!


435
00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:06.120
How many fairy tale balls
have you planned in your head?


436
00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:08.646
The music, the decor, right down
to the color of the napkins?


437
00:18:08.681 --> 00:18:10.912
I know. I know. You're right.
More times than is healthy,


438
00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:13.079
- but that's not the point.
- No. The point is,


439
00:18:13.115 --> 00:18:14.752
they're in trouble and
they need help.


440
00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:16.016
You'll come clean
afterwards. By then,


441
00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:17.445
you'll have saved the day.

442
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.053
You're the one who wanted to
shake the tree.


443
00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:21.013
Yeah, but this isn't a tree.
This is the whole forest.


444
00:18:21.048 --> 00:18:22.646
Well, then let's shake
the whole forest!


445
00:18:22.681 --> 00:18:25.113
We can do this! Come on.
You know we can.


446
00:18:25.148 --> 00:18:27.146
Plus, if we do it,

447
00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:28.912
we get to stay in
the castle.


448
00:18:42.147 --> 00:18:43.801
Available around
the clock?


449
00:18:43.826 --> 00:18:45.711
I'm not a
concierge service.


450
00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:48.014
That was unfair.
I should have said


451
00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:49.817
you'll be with them
every step of the way


452
00:18:49.842 --> 00:18:52.681
to ensure this gala is
as spectacular an affair


453
00:18:52.706 --> 00:18:54.399
as the duchess expects.

454
00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:56.008
Look, Siobhan, I just
really don't think that...


455
00:18:56.033 --> 00:18:57.319
You don't have to.

456
00:18:57.344 --> 00:19:00.066
Just make sure Paige
has what she needs


457
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:02.173
to pull the gala together
in the next two weeks.


458
00:19:02.198 --> 00:19:03.562
Take her where
she needs to go,


459
00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:05.030
introduce her to people,

460
00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:06.185
write checks.

461
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.463
You want to be
the hero?


462
00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:09.839
This is how you
do that.


463
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.289
I'll go press my cape.

464
00:19:24.398 --> 00:19:25.995
Are you serious?

465
00:19:28.808 --> 00:19:31.273
- This is what we're going in.
- Okay.


466
00:19:31.308 --> 00:19:33.652
Ladies, your
carriage awaits.


467
00:19:33.677 --> 00:19:35.835
Yes. Well, I wouldn't
have, uh, guessed


468
00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.481
chauffeur was included in
the job description of earl.


469
00:19:38.506 --> 00:19:40.096
You and I both,

470
00:19:40.121 --> 00:19:43.563
but my sister... and
I thought it best for me


471
00:19:43.588 --> 00:19:46.777
to accompany you at all times
to ensure our full support.


472
00:19:46.802 --> 00:19:47.956
At all times?
Is that...


473
00:19:47.981 --> 00:19:49.150
Yeah. No. We're fine on
our own.


474
00:19:49.175 --> 00:19:50.406
- Thanks
- Yeah.


475
00:19:50.441 --> 00:19:53.439
Suit yourself, but, uh,
just in case...


476
00:19:55.145 --> 00:19:56.589
Is this where you
were staying?


477
00:19:56.614 --> 00:19:58.759
- Yeah. Why?
- I just thought, uh...


478
00:19:58.784 --> 00:19:59.873
assumed women of
your tastes


479
00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:02.857
might choose somewhere
a little less, uh, quaint.


480
00:20:02.882 --> 00:20:04.182
Oh. You know
the old saying:


481
00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:07.046
Subtlety is the
cornerstone of class.


482
00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:10.254
We're meeting the duchess
at one, so before that,


483
00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:11.772
I'll get you settled
into your new quarters.


484
00:20:11.797 --> 00:20:13.992
Oh, uh, we might need
some extra clothing racks,


485
00:20:14.017 --> 00:20:16.326
because we didn't
exactly pack light, so...


486
00:20:16.351 --> 00:20:18.240
I don't think that's going
to be an issue.


487
00:20:38.429 --> 00:20:40.086
Well, will it suffice?

488
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:42.308
Uh, yeah. This
will, uh...


489
00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:43.806
this will be
just fine. Thank you.


490
00:20:43.831 --> 00:20:45.687
Brilliant. Uh, the
adjoining room is Margot's.


491
00:20:45.712 --> 00:20:47.771
Uh, same size but
without a fireplace.


492
00:20:47.796 --> 00:20:49.370
- Great.
- I'll, uh, let you guys


493
00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:50.706
- get settled.
- Thank you.


494
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.132
Come on.

495
00:21:00.068 --> 00:21:01.186
Ah, I can't believe it!

496
00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:02.839
Uh, one
more thing. Um...


497
00:21:04.677 --> 00:21:06.884
Hi. Yeah. Uh, we
were just looking for a...


498
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:08.711
A spider. There...
there was a... a spider.


499
00:21:08.736 --> 00:21:10.280
Right, and we were going
to catch it, because...


500
00:21:10.305 --> 00:21:11.809
With your bare hands?

501
00:21:11.834 --> 00:21:13.161
We're from New York.

502
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.106
Right. Uh, well, I
just wanted to let you know,


503
00:21:18.137 --> 00:21:20.816
the spa, in-room dining,
etc. is on the house.


504
00:21:20.841 --> 00:21:22.665
- Oh, lovely.
- Oh. Great.


505
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.961
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


506
00:21:23.986 --> 00:21:25.939
Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:21:45.753 --> 00:21:48.921
Remember, you address the
duchess as Your Grace.


508
00:21:48.946 --> 00:21:51.433
Oh. What am I doing?
I'm sure you've worked


509
00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:53.641
with members of
the aristocracy before.


510
00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:55.083
It never hurts to
be prepared.


511
00:21:55.108 --> 00:21:58.339
Uh, she can be a
bit, uh... precise.


512
00:21:58.364 --> 00:22:00.977
We'll be fine. Brooke's a
bit precise herself.


513
00:22:01.002 --> 00:22:02.313
Who?

514
00:22:04.334 --> 00:22:06.526
Oh, Brooke... Brooke
is a... It's...


515
00:22:06.551 --> 00:22:07.853
It... It's
a nickname.


516
00:22:07.878 --> 00:22:09.304
I used to read
a ton, and my mom


517
00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:11.513
would call me
her little bookworm,


518
00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:12.507
but when Margot
said it,


519
00:22:12.538 --> 00:22:14.167
it came out
"Brooke-worm."


520
00:22:14.192 --> 00:22:15.595
- So cute.
- Yeah. Brooke-worm.


521
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.329
So, it just kind of
stuck. You know.


522
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:21.824
Now, I hate to ask
you this, but...


523
00:22:21.849 --> 00:22:24.268
the duchess can't know
I lost my event planner,


524
00:22:24.293 --> 00:22:27.186
or she'll question whether
I'm up to the task.


525
00:22:27.211 --> 00:22:29.408
We'll play along. We're fine
bending the truth.


526
00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:31.073
Only when it's
for a good cause.


527
00:22:31.108 --> 00:22:32.627
- Okay.
- Yes.


528
00:22:41.212 --> 00:22:44.806
Your Grace, so nice to see you.
Allow me to introduce,


529
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:48.913
from New York, Paige
Monaghan and Margot Bennett.


530
00:22:48.938 --> 00:22:52.135
Ladies, the Duchess
of Abercorn,


531
00:22:52.166 --> 00:22:53.538
Julia Dunlevy.

532
00:22:53.563 --> 00:22:55.013
Your Grace,
it's a pleasure.


533
00:22:55.038 --> 00:22:58.349
Your Grace, sweet place.

534
00:22:58.374 --> 00:23:01.743
My mother's third
husband was a Monaghan.


535
00:23:01.768 --> 00:23:04.696
Which branch of the tree are
you descendent from?


536
00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:07.247
It is Seamus or Cillian?

537
00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:08.863
- Uh...
- Seamus.


538
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:10.521
- Mm.
- Seamus, right? Yeah.


539
00:23:10.546 --> 00:23:15.314
For a long time, we thought
it was, uh, uh, the other one,


540
00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:18.023
but, uh, no.
Seamus.


541
00:23:18.054 --> 00:23:20.405
Ah. So, did
your people...


542
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.194
My, my. Look at
the time.


543
00:23:22.218 --> 00:23:23.995
I think we really should
discuss this gala.


544
00:23:24.034 --> 00:23:26.187
- Of course.
- Great.


545
00:23:26.211 --> 00:23:29.300
Uh, is Mr. O'Sullivan
not joining us?


546
00:23:29.325 --> 00:23:32.026
Mr. O'Sullivan
has been let go.


547
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:35.451
His efforts didn't reflect
the taste and elegance


548
00:23:35.476 --> 00:23:37.560
befitting a woman
of your refinement.


549
00:23:37.585 --> 00:23:39.589
This is where
Margot and I excel.


550
00:23:39.621 --> 00:23:40.862
So, we'd love to
hear from you,


551
00:23:40.893 --> 00:23:42.283
your vision.

552
00:23:42.308 --> 00:23:44.179
Anyone can throw
a glitter and gold,


553
00:23:44.204 --> 00:23:46.379
"put the royals to
shame" Christmas gala,


554
00:23:46.404 --> 00:23:48.268
but what do you want?

555
00:23:48.304 --> 00:23:50.502
Exactly what
you just described.


556
00:23:50.537 --> 00:23:53.312
Okay. Alright. I...
I do think


557
00:23:53.337 --> 00:23:56.307
there's an opportunity here
to do something really unique.


558
00:23:56.332 --> 00:23:58.779
Let's create an event people
are actually excited about


559
00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.469
and look forward
to every year.


560
00:24:00.504 --> 00:24:02.785
Let's put the
moonlight to shame.


561
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.611
We know how
to throw a banger.


562
00:24:04.636 --> 00:24:06.036
A what?

563
00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:08.669
- A banger. It's, like, a...
- No.


564
00:24:08.704 --> 00:24:10.369
Why don't you tell us
about the event


565
00:24:10.394 --> 00:24:12.463
and what it means to
you? And then we can...


566
00:24:12.488 --> 00:24:13.948
we can go from there.

567
00:24:13.973 --> 00:24:16.928
Well, it is more than
just a Christmas party.


568
00:24:16.953 --> 00:24:19.245
This is the social
event of the season.


569
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.302
My guests expect the finest
food, elegant decor,


570
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:24.827
- classical music.
- Yeah.


571
00:24:24.852 --> 00:24:26.497
And money
is no object,


572
00:24:26.522 --> 00:24:30.145
but it must be something
special, memorable.


573
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:34.247
Oh, I don't think anyone's
going to forget this year. Nope.


574
00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:36.212
And accomplishing
that in 12 days


575
00:24:36.237 --> 00:24:38.113
won't be a
problem, will it?


576
00:24:38.137 --> 00:24:40.036
- Oh, Pfft.
- Twelve days? Oh, for us,


577
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:41.936
no, no. Twelve
days is a...


578
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:43.202
It's a dream.

579
00:24:43.237 --> 00:24:45.453
- Totally.
- Total dream.


580
00:24:45.478 --> 00:24:47.875
This is a nightmare. I mean,
all of the decorations


581
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.546
they used last year have
already been rented.


582
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:50.946
The two major rental
houses in Dublin,


583
00:24:50.971 --> 00:24:52.401
they have zero inventory.

584
00:24:52.426 --> 00:24:54.476
There are no tasteful
Christmas decorations left,


585
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:56.036
and we haven't even started
looking for a caterer.


586
00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:57.702
Why can't the restaurant at
the castle just do it?


587
00:24:57.738 --> 00:24:59.302
Because they're set
up for dinner for 30,


588
00:24:59.337 --> 00:25:00.759
not catering
for 100!


589
00:25:00.784 --> 00:25:02.452
What are
we going to do?


590
00:25:02.477 --> 00:25:06.021
I don't think
we have a choice.


591
00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:08.546
We're going
to call the earl?


592
00:25:08.571 --> 00:25:10.602
Things are about to get
a little more complicated.


593
00:25:13.854 --> 00:25:15.370
If it's decorations you're
looking for,


594
00:25:15.395 --> 00:25:17.846
there's really onlyone place I
can think of, but...


595
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:19.917
But...

596
00:25:21.235 --> 00:25:23.526
Every year, the whole
of Glaslough would turn out


597
00:25:23.551 --> 00:25:25.587
for a massive holiday party,

598
00:25:25.612 --> 00:25:27.882
the twelve pubs
of Christmas.


599
00:25:27.907 --> 00:25:29.704
It would start at one end of
town and work its way


600
00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:31.978
from pub to pub
to the other end.


601
00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:33.300
We used to host the final stop

602
00:25:33.335 --> 00:25:35.634
on the castle grounds. It
was a lavish party


603
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:38.811
- with food, drinks, music.
- Yeah.


604
00:25:38.836 --> 00:25:41.100
It was a way of letting
the locals know


605
00:25:41.135 --> 00:25:43.700
that the castle was as
much theirs as ours.


606
00:25:43.736 --> 00:25:45.495
That's so nice.

607
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.911
But not anymore?

608
00:25:47.936 --> 00:25:49.987
After the remodel,
Siobhan felt that hosting


609
00:25:50.012 --> 00:25:52.468
the gala for the duchess
made better financial sense,


610
00:25:52.493 --> 00:25:54.734
given the type of clientele we
were hoping to attract.


611
00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:57.767
Mm, but why not
just do... do both?


612
00:25:57.803 --> 00:26:00.691
Unfortunately, they often land
on the same evening.


613
00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:03.942
Needless to say, the townsfolk
were none too pleased.


614
00:26:03.967 --> 00:26:06.811
They felt shunned by their
newly appointed earl.


615
00:26:06.836 --> 00:26:08.967
Ah, so I take it no
more free marshmallows


616
00:26:09.003 --> 00:26:10.599
in your hot chocolate.

617
00:26:10.624 --> 00:26:12.600
Precisely,

618
00:26:12.636 --> 00:26:15.122
and the one fella that
might be able to help us


619
00:26:15.147 --> 00:26:17.367
is the man with all
the marshmallows.


620
00:26:25.502 --> 00:26:28.034
Let me see if
I got this right.


621
00:26:28.059 --> 00:26:31.967
Your Lordship cancels the
community party,


622
00:26:32.003 --> 00:26:34.300
turns his back
on the entire town,


623
00:26:34.335 --> 00:26:37.100
and now, you're here looking
for a favor?


624
00:26:37.135 --> 00:26:42.100
Mr. O'Connor... Liam, if I may,
listen. I know how you feel.


625
00:26:42.135 --> 00:26:46.000
You know, sometimes, people make
incredibly selfish decisions


626
00:26:46.025 --> 00:26:49.432
without considering how other
people are going to be affected.


627
00:26:49.457 --> 00:26:51.971
- Who are you again?
- Paige Monaghan.


628
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:54.367
She's planning the
gala for the duchess.


629
00:26:54.402 --> 00:26:56.433
Any relation to
Darragh Monaghan?


630
00:26:56.469 --> 00:26:59.267
Uh... how far back do
you want to go?


631
00:26:59.302 --> 00:27:00.697
The invention of fire?

632
00:27:00.722 --> 00:27:02.084
It's likely.

633
00:27:03.093 --> 00:27:04.934
May I ask what this
is you're working on?


634
00:27:04.969 --> 00:27:07.312
It's a tree,
a Christmas tree.


635
00:27:07.337 --> 00:27:09.318
This is the top
section.


636
00:27:09.343 --> 00:27:12.354
Wow. That is unlike anything
I've ever seen before.


637
00:27:12.379 --> 00:27:13.734
Could I see
the rest of it?


638
00:27:13.769 --> 00:27:15.066
You can have a look,

639
00:27:15.102 --> 00:27:16.445
but not him.

640
00:27:17.903 --> 00:27:19.224
Close your eyes.

641
00:27:23.665 --> 00:27:25.277
You're the first person
outside of myself


642
00:27:25.302 --> 00:27:26.567
to lay eyes on this.

643
00:27:30.235 --> 00:27:31.934
Oh, wow.

644
00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:33.667
That is going to be
extraordinary.


645
00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:37.345
I know this is
a really big ask,


646
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.200
but is there any way
you would consider


647
00:27:39.231 --> 00:27:40.567
loaning that to
me for the night,


648
00:27:40.602 --> 00:27:42.033
for the gala?

649
00:27:42.058 --> 00:27:43.100
Uh...

650
00:27:43.135 --> 00:27:45.310
I get it. I would
be angry, too.


651
00:27:45.335 --> 00:27:47.546
I really would be.
I would be so angry,


652
00:27:47.571 --> 00:27:48.567
but you know
what I've learned


653
00:27:48.602 --> 00:27:50.700
about dealing with
people like him?


654
00:27:50.736 --> 00:27:52.626
The best thing is just
to prove them wrong.


655
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:54.467
Prove he has
no power over you.


656
00:27:54.492 --> 00:27:56.611
I mean, think about that.
Think about the look


657
00:27:56.636 --> 00:27:59.210
on the duchess's face
and the earl's face


658
00:27:59.235 --> 00:28:02.983
when they see your work
defiantly on display,


659
00:28:03.008 --> 00:28:04.644
saying, "Not only am I here,

660
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:06.700
but I am stealing
the show."


661
00:28:08.463 --> 00:28:11.318
I'll do it
for you. Not him.


662
00:28:11.343 --> 00:28:13.231
Oh, thank you.

663
00:28:15.803 --> 00:28:17.196
Thank you so much.

664
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:22.867
What has 14 letters and is
impossible to pronounce?


665
00:28:22.902 --> 00:28:24.534
The town where I found the
linens, place settings,


666
00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.279
- and glassware.
- You found the bone china?


667
00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:27.645
- Yes!
- Great, and what about the, uh,


668
00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.412
- tablecloths with the...
- With the lace scalloping?


669
00:28:29.444 --> 00:28:30.900
- Yeah?
- All of it. I had to bribe


670
00:28:30.935 --> 00:28:32.300
the lady with an
invite to the gala,


671
00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:33.767
but she agreed to
truck everything over.


672
00:28:33.803 --> 00:28:35.767
Amazing. Ten days to go.
We're making progress.


673
00:28:35.803 --> 00:28:37.112
Alright. What
about catering?


674
00:28:37.137 --> 00:28:39.033
No dice. I've
tried every person


675
00:28:39.058 --> 00:28:41.374
with a walk-in refrigerator
within 15 miles,


676
00:28:41.399 --> 00:28:43.106
but they're all booked.

677
00:28:43.131 --> 00:28:44.567
But I did have one idea.

678
00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:46.700
Just one?
That's unusual for you.


679
00:28:46.736 --> 00:28:49.319
I worked a party for Paige
last year, a big event,


680
00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:51.277
and the guest chef was
out of Dublin.


681
00:28:51.302 --> 00:28:53.098
I was thinking I could find
her name online.


682
00:28:53.123 --> 00:28:55.600
Wait. No, no, no. If... if she and
Paige already know each other...


683
00:28:55.636 --> 00:28:56.900
That could work in
our favor, you know.


684
00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.433
We just say that Paige
couldn't make it


685
00:28:58.469 --> 00:28:59.880
and she sent you instead.

686
00:29:03.435 --> 00:29:05.877
I mean, we're probably
spending the rest of our 30s


687
00:29:05.902 --> 00:29:07.144
in an eight-by-10
cell anyway,


688
00:29:07.169 --> 00:29:08.400
so let's just go
down swinging.


689
00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:10.549
Yes! I mean, we're
not, but yay!


690
00:29:10.574 --> 00:29:11.933
Okay.

691
00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:14.322
Okay.

692
00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:17.408
I was just on my way to see
if you needed anything.


693
00:29:17.433 --> 00:29:19.033
You know, you sure do
have a lot of free time


694
00:29:19.068 --> 00:29:21.537
for an earl who moonlights
as a chauffeur.


695
00:29:21.562 --> 00:29:23.597
Well, I'm
in between gigs.


696
00:29:23.622 --> 00:29:25.400
I noticed your card
said architect.


697
00:29:25.435 --> 00:29:27.367
I assume that's a...
a day job?


698
00:29:27.402 --> 00:29:29.200
- Yeah.
- Did you do this?


699
00:29:29.235 --> 00:29:31.394
No. This is all
Siobhan. It's, uh...


700
00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:34.859
Actually, it's the first time
I'm seeing it since completion.


701
00:29:34.884 --> 00:29:37.033
Oh. Do you... do
you not live here?


702
00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:39.433
I live wherever my
projects are.


703
00:29:39.469 --> 00:29:41.367
I just spent the
last six months in Italy,


704
00:29:41.402 --> 00:29:45.114
and before that,
Germany, China, Dubai.


705
00:29:45.139 --> 00:29:47.409
That sounds so
exotic.


706
00:29:47.434 --> 00:29:48.943
Jennifer Barclay!

707
00:29:48.968 --> 00:29:51.093
She's based in Dublin.
She's potentially available


708
00:29:51.118 --> 00:29:52.544
and wants to meet at
one to discuss.


709
00:29:52.569 --> 00:29:54.167
She loved working
for Paige.


710
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:58.600
For you. Working for
you. You're Paige.


711
00:29:58.636 --> 00:30:00.523
Correct, and
you're Margot.


712
00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:01.977
- I'm Margot.
- Hi, Margot.


713
00:30:02.002 --> 00:30:04.636
- Hey.
- Just a fun little game


714
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:05.900
we play.

715
00:30:05.935 --> 00:30:08.400
- Well, I'm Aiden.
- Hey, Aiden.


716
00:30:09.386 --> 00:30:10.480
Who loved working for you?

717
00:30:10.505 --> 00:30:13.066
Uh, a
caterer in Dublin.


718
00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:15.810
Right. So, it... it's noon.
I should probably get moving.


719
00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:18.066
- Oh, I'll give you a ride.
- No! No.


720
00:30:18.102 --> 00:30:19.426
- Uh-uh. No.
- Don't do that.


721
00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:22.391
Uh-uh. I... I... No. I can...
I'll I'll drive myself.


722
00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:23.758
- Right.
- All the way to Dublin?


723
00:30:23.782 --> 00:30:25.520
- Yeah.
- Siobhan would have my head.


724
00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:26.761
- Come on.
- Okay.


725
00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:28.700
The car's right in front.

726
00:30:28.725 --> 00:30:30.400
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.


727
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:43.438
Uh, you... you don't
need to come in.


728
00:30:43.463 --> 00:30:45.648
In fact, it's probably better
that you don't.


729
00:30:45.673 --> 00:30:48.910
You know, after the whole
earl thing with Liam and...


730
00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:51.377
Why do I suddenly feel like
Ebenezer Scrooge?


731
00:30:51.402 --> 00:30:53.000
But much better
looking.


732
00:30:54.902 --> 00:30:58.110
Not that I'm looking or...
or not looking


733
00:30:58.135 --> 00:31:00.743
and... and
not not looking.


734
00:31:00.768 --> 00:31:02.320
I
-I'll be back.

735
00:31:05.782 --> 00:31:07.133
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Brooke.


736
00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:08.977
I'm flattered Paige
thought of me.


737
00:31:09.002 --> 00:31:11.033
You did such a great job
with the event in New York.


738
00:31:11.068 --> 00:31:13.925
Oh, I appreciate that,
and a gala at the castle


739
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.600
sounds right up my alley.

740
00:31:16.636 --> 00:31:18.981
I am committed to another
event that weekend,


741
00:31:19.006 --> 00:31:20.544
so I'd have to bring
on extra help.


742
00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:22.634
Well, I hear money
is no object.


743
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:25.233
In that case, let's
try a few things, eh?


744
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:28.408
Oh, let's. I mean,
this is the best part.


745
00:31:28.433 --> 00:31:29.477
That's why we're here.

746
00:31:29.502 --> 00:31:31.733
- May I?
- Please.


747
00:31:31.768 --> 00:31:33.663
Mmm.

748
00:31:33.688 --> 00:31:35.033
- Excuse me.
- Oh! Hey.


749
00:31:35.068 --> 00:31:37.100
Can you tell me where
I could find Siobhan Hart?


750
00:31:37.135 --> 00:31:38.567
Oh, uh, I
don't know.


751
00:31:38.592 --> 00:31:40.273
I'm... I'm overseeing
the work.


752
00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:43.233
The candelabras look
gorgeous.


753
00:31:43.258 --> 00:31:45.593
Fiona Walsh,
Lifestyle Ireland.


754
00:31:45.618 --> 00:31:48.395
I was hoping to get a few
more details about the gala.


755
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.963
- Perhaps you can help me.
- Uh, you know,


756
00:31:49.988 --> 00:31:51.534
you're better off
speaking with my boss,


757
00:31:51.569 --> 00:31:53.429
Paige or Ms. Monaghan.

758
00:31:53.454 --> 00:31:55.568
Paige Monaghan?

759
00:31:55.593 --> 00:31:56.995
You are kidding.

760
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.433
She did a few events
in London that I covered.


761
00:31:59.469 --> 00:32:01.077
Oh. That's...

762
00:32:01.102 --> 00:32:02.910
Small world!

763
00:32:02.935 --> 00:32:04.912
Well, she's not here right now,
but she'll be really sorry


764
00:32:04.937 --> 00:32:06.144
she missed you, so...

765
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:09.345
Well, I'll be here for
an hour or so.


766
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.703
Could you call her,

767
00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:13.100
just let her
know I'm here?


768
00:32:13.135 --> 00:32:15.027
Like, right now?

769
00:32:15.052 --> 00:32:16.590
Yeah.

770
00:32:20.656 --> 00:32:21.933
Are you hungry?

771
00:32:21.968 --> 00:32:24.448
Clara makes a dangerously
good meat pie.


772
00:32:24.473 --> 00:32:26.300
I'm okay. I ate at
the caterer's office.


773
00:32:26.335 --> 00:32:28.467
Ah. I didn't
realize. Yeah.


774
00:32:28.502 --> 00:32:31.534
If you'll recall, I was, uh,
waiting in the car.


775
00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:32.766
Right.

776
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:34.733
Sorry.

777
00:32:37.834 --> 00:32:39.511
Hey, there.
How's it going?


778
00:32:39.536 --> 00:32:40.743
Hey, Paige!

779
00:32:40.768 --> 00:32:42.663
So, fun coincidence.

780
00:32:42.688 --> 00:32:45.966
Uh, the reporter,
Fiona Walsh,


781
00:32:46.002 --> 00:32:48.993
that you met
in London, is here.


782
00:32:49.018 --> 00:32:52.341
Really? Oh, that
is fun.


783
00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:53.810
Yeah! I know!

784
00:32:53.835 --> 00:32:56.567
And, um, she's going to
be here for another hour,


785
00:32:56.602 --> 00:32:58.281
and she'd love
to see you.


786
00:32:58.306 --> 00:32:59.835
When will you be back?

787
00:33:02.072 --> 00:33:04.491
Oh. You'll be gone at
least two hours?


788
00:33:04.516 --> 00:33:05.451
- Yeah.
- Oh, too bad.


789
00:33:05.476 --> 00:33:07.277
You'll miss her
entirely. Okay. Bye.


790
00:33:07.302 --> 00:33:08.666
Mm. Sorry.

791
00:33:09.892 --> 00:33:12.147
She's not going
to be back, so...


792
00:33:12.172 --> 00:33:13.864
Okay. Got it.

793
00:33:13.889 --> 00:33:17.167
Well, I... I am just so glad that
you got it to stop bleeding.


794
00:33:18.718 --> 00:33:21.051
- Bleeding?
- Yeah. Just a little minor...


795
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:22.916
minor injury.

796
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:24.470
You know what?

797
00:33:24.495 --> 00:33:25.866
I am kind of hungry.

798
00:33:25.891 --> 00:33:26.990
Are you sure?
Because...


799
00:33:27.015 --> 00:33:28.244
Yeah. No. I'm
actually starving.


800
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:29.534
We should stop.
Can we stop?


801
00:33:29.569 --> 00:33:30.706
Let's just stop.

802
00:33:31.569 --> 00:33:34.010
Okay. Meat pies it is.

803
00:33:34.035 --> 00:33:35.134
Great.

804
00:33:40.332 --> 00:33:42.182
Too much meat
or not enough pie?


805
00:33:42.213 --> 00:33:43.845
Oh, no, no, no. It's
delicious. I just think


806
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.919
my eyes were a bit
bigger than my stomach.


807
00:33:45.944 --> 00:33:48.619
- Thanks, Clara. Just the check.
- No, no. No. No.


808
00:33:48.644 --> 00:33:51.391
You know what we don't do
anymore as people?


809
00:33:51.423 --> 00:33:53.771
We don't just sit
and chat, you know?


810
00:33:53.796 --> 00:33:58.297
Like, really just take our
time and just... chat.


811
00:33:58.328 --> 00:34:02.684
Right. I hear you're
helping with the gala.


812
00:34:02.709 --> 00:34:04.229
I don't suppose that
leaves much time


813
00:34:04.254 --> 00:34:07.023
for hunting down your
relatives. O'Reilly, wasn't it?


814
00:34:07.048 --> 00:34:08.864
Yeah. We haven't even
started looking.


815
00:34:08.903 --> 00:34:10.098
Well, when you do,

816
00:34:10.123 --> 00:34:11.825
have a chat with
the duchess.


817
00:34:11.857 --> 00:34:13.814
She has a
near-encyclopedic knowledge of


818
00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:15.592
who's who
and what's what


819
00:34:15.617 --> 00:34:17.581
and who went where
with who, wearing what.


820
00:34:18.631 --> 00:34:21.081
Okay. I'll... I'll do
that. Thank you.


821
00:34:23.096 --> 00:34:24.791
O'Reilly?

822
00:34:24.816 --> 00:34:26.184
Yeah. My father's
birth parents.


823
00:34:26.209 --> 00:34:27.615
He was adopted.

824
00:34:27.647 --> 00:34:29.278
I'm Bennett.

825
00:34:29.318 --> 00:34:31.281
You mean Monaghan.

826
00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:34.391
Uh, right.

827
00:34:34.422 --> 00:34:38.457
Yeah. No. No. Bennett
is my, um, my married name.


828
00:34:38.488 --> 00:34:39.978
Yeah. Or was.

829
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.950
I'm divorced.

830
00:34:41.983 --> 00:34:43.594
Almost a year now.

831
00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:45.382
Well, I'm sorry.

832
00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:47.915
Oh, it wasn't
your fault.


833
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.621
Unless you were
secretly advising him


834
00:34:49.653 --> 00:34:50.948
to shut down emotionally

835
00:34:50.983 --> 00:34:53.282
and make wildly irresponsible
financial decisions.


836
00:34:53.317 --> 00:34:55.081
- Were you doing that?
- I don't recall


837
00:34:55.117 --> 00:34:56.948
having those
conversations, no.


838
00:34:58.516 --> 00:35:00.315
It's for the best.

839
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.481
I mean, starting
over is... is tough,


840
00:35:03.505 --> 00:35:08.056
but, um, I guess you could say I
find myself in a bit of a...


841
00:35:08.098 --> 00:35:09.862
Crisis of identity?

842
00:35:11.583 --> 00:35:13.725
Yeah.

843
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.181
What does that mean?

844
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.472
That's a holiday version
of an old Irish proverb.


845
00:35:20.496 --> 00:35:22.330
"May the most you wish
for this Christmas


846
00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:23.714
be the least you get."

847
00:35:25.137 --> 00:35:26.469
And the red one?

848
00:35:27.893 --> 00:35:30.157
"Two people
shorten the road."


849
00:35:32.992 --> 00:35:34.981
Well, I suppose we
should be getting back.


850
00:35:35.017 --> 00:35:36.450
They'll be wondering
where we've gotten off to.


851
00:35:36.474 --> 00:35:38.748
I should just check
in with Margot.


852
00:35:42.683 --> 00:35:44.625
Hey! I was just, uh,
checking in


853
00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.257
to see if the room
is free of, uh, workers.


854
00:35:48.282 --> 00:35:51.382
The partridge is still
in the pear tree.


855
00:35:51.407 --> 00:35:53.189
Okay. So...?

856
00:35:53.214 --> 00:35:57.318
I repeat, the partridge
is still in the pear tree.


857
00:35:57.343 --> 00:36:00.058
Right. What
does that mean?


858
00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:04.881
The partridge is
still in the pear tree!


859
00:36:08.348 --> 00:36:09.614
Okay. Great. Thanks.

860
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.130
Uh, yeah. So, the, um,
the ballroom is still a...


861
00:36:13.155 --> 00:36:17.992
It's a work zone, and, uh,
Margot is, um, bird-watching.


862
00:36:18.017 --> 00:36:20.353
Um, so it looks like
we have a little free time.


863
00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:23.229
If there was one thing
that tourists never get to see,


864
00:36:23.254 --> 00:36:25.215
what would it be?

865
00:36:36.764 --> 00:36:38.932
Um, if we're going
to confession,


866
00:36:38.957 --> 00:36:40.496
I'm going to need
to take a raincheck.


867
00:36:40.521 --> 00:36:41.992
Don't worry.
Your secrets are safe.


868
00:36:42.017 --> 00:36:43.514
This chapel hasn't been
used in years.


869
00:36:44.674 --> 00:36:45.872
Wow. It's beautiful.

870
00:36:45.897 --> 00:36:47.915
We'd just had our
Christmas Eve service


871
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.181
when a huge storm
came through.


872
00:36:51.449 --> 00:36:52.892
We haven't had much luck

873
00:36:52.917 --> 00:36:55.781
finding someone to
properly restore it.


874
00:36:55.816 --> 00:36:58.889
Well, maybe this
is your next project.


875
00:36:58.914 --> 00:37:02.506
I design office buildings
and hotels, apartments.


876
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:06.225
My one and only experience
with restoration


877
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.048
didn't exactly leave a
pleasant taste in my mouth.


878
00:37:09.083 --> 00:37:11.115
How so?

879
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.748
The build I was
on in Italy,


880
00:37:12.783 --> 00:37:15.292
we, uh, we promised
we'd preserve


881
00:37:15.317 --> 00:37:16.814
the historic
buildings around it,


882
00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.414
but financially, it
would have buried us,


883
00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:21.781
so... we didn't.

884
00:37:21.816 --> 00:37:23.081
Oh. Ouch.

885
00:37:23.117 --> 00:37:24.581
And then being
confronted by the woman


886
00:37:24.616 --> 00:37:28.048
whose family had lived
there for generations...


887
00:37:29.017 --> 00:37:31.547
Oh, she
was devastated.


888
00:37:33.355 --> 00:37:34.614
I quit the next day.

889
00:37:35.822 --> 00:37:38.547
Really? Just
like that?


890
00:37:38.572 --> 00:37:42.547
Yeah. I, uh... just
couldn't do it anymore.


891
00:37:44.244 --> 00:37:46.276
You know, my mom always
said that sometimes,


892
00:37:46.301 --> 00:37:49.748
you have to hit bottom
to find your way to the top.


893
00:37:53.992 --> 00:37:55.683
I really miss her.

894
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:57.135
I'm sorry.

895
00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.752
Yeah. It makes
you realize how easily


896
00:37:58.777 --> 00:38:00.739
we take people for granted
when they're healthy.


897
00:38:02.561 --> 00:38:05.042
Family is just the
single greatest gift


898
00:38:05.067 --> 00:38:08.881
we're given. We got to...
love them as hard as we can


899
00:38:08.906 --> 00:38:11.106
while we can,

900
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:12.347
flaws and all.

901
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.881
But the good news is,

902
00:38:15.917 --> 00:38:17.748
it's never too late
to become the people...


903
00:38:17.783 --> 00:38:21.925
or person of Irish
noble descent...


904
00:38:22.726 --> 00:38:24.215
that we really
want to be.


905
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.394
Two questions.

906
00:38:30.595 --> 00:38:34.115
Do you, um... do you
have any plans tonight?


907
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:38.148
And, um, how do you
feel about large crowds


908
00:38:38.183 --> 00:38:42.215
and centuries-old
tree-lighting ceremonies?


909
00:38:46.182 --> 00:38:47.658
Honey, I'm home!

910
00:38:47.683 --> 00:38:49.825
I hope you enjoyed gallivanting
around the countryside


911
00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.746
with Prince Charming while
I'm stuck here


912
00:38:51.771 --> 00:38:53.414
like some spy
behind enemy lines.


913
00:38:53.449 --> 00:38:55.324
Oh. Eating
chocolate-covered almonds.


914
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:57.005
You look like you are
really suffering.


915
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.048
Well, I am.

916
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.796
What's with the smile?

917
00:39:02.821 --> 00:39:05.755
- I'm not.
- Spill it! What?


918
00:39:05.783 --> 00:39:07.674
Nothing!
It's nothing.


919
00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:10.547
I... It was...
it was a good day.


920
00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:13.059
Yeah. The caterer
is confirmed, and, uh...


921
00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:15.081
Oh, I learned the duchess is
who we should talk to


922
00:39:15.117 --> 00:39:16.714
- about Dad's lineage.
- Oh.


923
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.748
And, uh, what
else? What else?


924
00:39:18.783 --> 00:39:21.151
Oh, Aiden invited us to
the tree lighting tonight.


925
00:39:21.176 --> 00:39:22.258
Us or you?

926
00:39:22.283 --> 00:39:24.948
Us. You and me. Us.

927
00:39:24.983 --> 00:39:28.247
Margot, it's a casual
invite to a casual event.


928
00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:29.547
Mm-hmm.

929
00:39:31.416 --> 00:39:33.215
Can you help me pick
out something to wear?


930
00:39:34.249 --> 00:39:35.948
Alright.

931
00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:45.781
Relax. You look great.

932
00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.414
What? I'm not
trying to.


933
00:39:47.449 --> 00:39:48.915
No. I... I wasn't even
looking at myself.


934
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.311
I was just looking
around for...


935
00:39:50.336 --> 00:39:52.262
Impeccable timing.

936
00:39:52.287 --> 00:39:53.547
Hi.

937
00:39:53.583 --> 00:39:55.881
You look nice.
Both of you.


938
00:39:55.917 --> 00:39:56.853
- Oh.
- Thanks.


939
00:39:56.878 --> 00:39:58.281
Thank you. So do you.

940
00:39:58.316 --> 00:40:00.092
Well, they're just about
to start. Shall we?


941
00:40:00.117 --> 00:40:01.381
Okay.

942
00:40:10.714 --> 00:40:13.648
Welcome,
welcome, everybody,


943
00:40:13.683 --> 00:40:16.848
to the annual
lighting of the tree.


944
00:40:18.019 --> 00:40:19.614
Firstly, I'd like to...

945
00:40:21.316 --> 00:40:23.058
My lord.

946
00:40:23.083 --> 00:40:26.736
I didn't realize you'd be
in attendance this evening.


947
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:31.915
Uh, would you care to
grace us with a few words?


948
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.580
- Go on.
- Go on.


949
00:40:33.605 --> 00:40:34.915
- Of course.
- Yeah!


950
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.915
His Lordship.

951
00:40:36.947 --> 00:40:38.319
Whoo-hoo!

952
00:40:39.483 --> 00:40:41.970
Thank you, Mayor.
Uh, I'm as surprised


953
00:40:41.995 --> 00:40:44.204
by my attendance
as you are.


954
00:40:44.917 --> 00:40:46.791
But there's only
so much lounging around


955
00:40:46.816 --> 00:40:49.414
with a golden scepter one
man can tolerate.


956
00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.147
And the truth
is, I...


957
00:41:03.483 --> 00:41:05.758
If you're going to throw
a snowball at someone,


958
00:41:05.783 --> 00:41:08.948
you best be careful, because
that someone may be inclined...


959
00:41:12.163 --> 00:41:13.594
To throw it back.

960
00:41:15.022 --> 00:41:16.238
Ah!

961
00:41:17.151 --> 00:41:18.419
- Oh!
- Alright.


962
00:41:18.444 --> 00:41:20.242
I'd say that's a hint
to get on with it,


963
00:41:20.273 --> 00:41:21.837
so let's get on
with it.


964
00:41:21.862 --> 00:41:23.031
Five!

965
00:41:23.056 --> 00:41:25.247
Four! Three!

966
00:41:25.283 --> 00:41:27.781
Two! One!

967
00:41:36.149 --> 00:41:37.614
I showed him
what's what, huh?


968
00:41:37.952 --> 00:41:39.481
You kind of throw
like an earl.


969
00:41:40.324 --> 00:41:43.327
You handled that very nicely.

970
00:41:43.352 --> 00:41:45.475
Perhaps some of your wit and
charm is rubbing off,


971
00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:46.607
Ms. Monaghan.

972
00:41:53.049 --> 00:41:56.089
Shoes. Shoes.
Where are my shoes?


973
00:41:56.114 --> 00:41:58.322
Did you check the spot
where we keep the shoes?


974
00:41:58.347 --> 00:42:00.502
Right. Of course. Oh,
yeah. Here we are.


975
00:42:00.527 --> 00:42:01.781
You seem a little
scattered this morning.


976
00:42:01.806 --> 00:42:03.623
- Is everything alright?
- I'm fine.


977
00:42:03.648 --> 00:42:06.145
It's just, we have four
days until the party,


978
00:42:06.181 --> 00:42:08.274
and we still don't
have a band!


979
00:42:08.299 --> 00:42:10.779
And it's not because you're
meeting the earl in...


980
00:42:10.815 --> 00:42:12.079
well, 10
minutes ago.


981
00:42:12.114 --> 00:42:13.785
Wait. Are you
serious? I'm late?


982
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.464
I'm messing
with you,


983
00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:17.937
but you might want to keep
your cards closer to your vest.


984
00:42:17.962 --> 00:42:20.079
They're
showing a bit.


985
00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:22.713
Are you sure you're okay
hanging back today?


986
00:42:22.748 --> 00:42:24.932
Yeah. I'm going
to hit the duchess up


987
00:42:24.963 --> 00:42:26.890
for some more info
on Dad's family.


988
00:42:26.915 --> 00:42:28.248
Maybe try to bond,

989
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.472
see if she'll adopt me.

990
00:42:29.497 --> 00:42:31.713
Nice. Purse.
Where's my purse?


991
00:42:31.748 --> 00:42:33.179
Uh...

992
00:42:36.514 --> 00:42:37.823
- I'm fine.
- Yeah.


993
00:42:37.848 --> 00:42:39.446
Yeah. Okay.

994
00:42:41.851 --> 00:42:43.796
What adventure
awaits us today?


995
00:42:43.831 --> 00:42:46.797
Any chance you know where to
find a string quartet?


996
00:42:46.822 --> 00:42:48.429
Uh, hold on a sec.

997
00:42:49.297 --> 00:42:51.329
No.

998
00:42:51.364 --> 00:42:54.095
But I do know a
well-connected baron.


999
00:42:54.131 --> 00:42:55.953
Perhaps we should
go say hello.


1000
00:42:55.978 --> 00:42:57.030
Alright.

1001
00:43:21.364 --> 00:43:23.195
It's been
too long, my boy,


1002
00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:26.496
but a wonderful
surprise nonetheless.


1003
00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:29.615
I'm afraid I may not be
of much help with the music.


1004
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.662
There was a time I knew

1005
00:43:30.687 --> 00:43:32.995
of two or three
different string outfits


1006
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:34.963
from parties I've
thrown over the years,


1007
00:43:34.997 --> 00:43:38.295
but, uh, those days
are long over.


1008
00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.262
Does it have
to be strings?


1009
00:43:40.297 --> 00:43:41.829
Well, I mean, I think we
should steer clear


1010
00:43:41.865 --> 00:43:44.028
of, you know,
bongos and bagpipes,


1011
00:43:44.064 --> 00:43:46.192
but I think we can afford to
get a little creative.


1012
00:43:46.217 --> 00:43:48.496
- What were you thinking?
- Well, I seem to recall you


1013
00:43:48.531 --> 00:43:50.492
tickling the ivories
now and again.


1014
00:43:50.517 --> 00:43:52.195
He puts Elton to shame.

1015
00:43:52.231 --> 00:43:54.363
Jazz, classical,
rock, you name it.


1016
00:43:54.388 --> 00:43:55.796
He exaggerates,

1017
00:43:55.831 --> 00:43:57.095
but I do play.

1018
00:44:18.504 --> 00:44:20.829
Oh, that was so beautiful.

1019
00:44:20.865 --> 00:44:23.202
I'm meant to appear
at the gala as a guest,


1020
00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:24.772
but if you can drag in a piano,

1021
00:44:24.803 --> 00:44:27.058
I'd be happy to
play for my supper.


1022
00:44:27.089 --> 00:44:29.796
Really?
Oh, that would be so great.


1023
00:44:29.821 --> 00:44:32.093
That... that... that
would be amazing. Thank you.


1024
00:44:32.132 --> 00:44:33.107
My pleasure.

1025
00:44:33.132 --> 00:44:35.019
I wanted to ask you
about your horses. They're...


1026
00:44:35.064 --> 00:44:37.743
just magnificent.
Is that an Arabian?


1027
00:44:37.768 --> 00:44:40.022
You have a good eye.
Do you ride?


1028
00:44:40.047 --> 00:44:43.742
I do. Well, I did.
It's been forever.


1029
00:44:43.774 --> 00:44:45.415
For me, as well.

1030
00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.510
Perhaps we could
take them for a quick spin,


1031
00:44:47.535 --> 00:44:49.330
stretch your legs a little bit.

1032
00:44:51.317 --> 00:44:53.229
You remind me a lot of my son.

1033
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:56.195
He's confident, unique.

1034
00:44:56.859 --> 00:44:57.510
Oh.

1035
00:44:57.541 --> 00:45:00.990
So, you came here to ask about
lineage Monaghan, I presume?


1036
00:45:01.029 --> 00:45:03.863
No. O'Reilly.
Our dad was adopted.


1037
00:45:03.888 --> 00:45:06.095
We've got the records
but no first names.


1038
00:45:06.131 --> 00:45:07.964
Well, any other clues?
Pictures?


1039
00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:09.740
Oh, well, had a teddy bear

1040
00:45:09.765 --> 00:45:11.473
from when he was born
and here was a locket on it


1041
00:45:11.498 --> 00:45:13.508
with "freedom" written inside.

1042
00:45:13.533 --> 00:45:16.759
Freedom? Hmm.
It's not a lot to go on.


1043
00:45:16.784 --> 00:45:18.933
I know.
Sorry for wasting your time.


1044
00:45:18.964 --> 00:45:21.206
Oh, on the contrary, my dear.

1045
00:45:21.231 --> 00:45:24.631
There's nothing I love
more than a good puzzle.


1046
00:45:25.567 --> 00:45:27.529
Oh. Eggnog?

1047
00:45:27.564 --> 00:45:30.928
Thank you. Mm.

1048
00:45:35.534 --> 00:45:36.533
Oh!

1049
00:45:37.297 --> 00:45:38.840
Irish eggnog.

1050
00:45:38.864 --> 00:45:40.840
Cool. Nice.

1051
00:45:40.864 --> 00:45:41.662
To freedom.

1052
00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:43.828
To freedom! Ooh...

1053
00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:46.747
Now, tell me more a
bout your father.


1054
00:45:46.786 --> 00:45:48.829
Oh, well, it's a long story.

1055
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.262
I just don't know why he'd ever
want to leave a place like this.


1056
00:46:20.018 --> 00:46:21.920
Yeah.

1057
00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:24.552
Do you ever think
about moving back?


1058
00:46:26.167 --> 00:46:27.845
I'm not sure it's that simple.

1059
00:46:31.405 --> 00:46:35.195
My father was a brilliant man,
you know, beloved, revered,


1060
00:46:36.018 --> 00:46:38.819
and he left behind
an immense set of shoes,


1061
00:46:39.974 --> 00:46:42.066
and I've always had this
nagging feeling that...


1062
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.244
I wasn't fit to fill them.

1063
00:46:45.591 --> 00:46:48.855
It's funny how often
I've proven that to be true.


1064
00:46:50.955 --> 00:46:52.376
Maybe, but...

1065
00:46:53.934 --> 00:46:55.982
you know, our mistakes
don't define us;


1066
00:46:57.051 --> 00:46:58.355
They give us perspective.

1067
00:47:00.344 --> 00:47:04.316
You know? And it's likely you won't
fill your father's shoes,


1068
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.790
but... I don't know,

1069
00:47:07.815 --> 00:47:10.140
it's never too late to become
the person you want to be,


1070
00:47:12.247 --> 00:47:14.895
and I think that person
is more than enough.


1071
00:47:18.595 --> 00:47:19.801
I just said it!

1072
00:47:19.826 --> 00:47:22.174
I don't know why!

1073
00:47:22.199 --> 00:47:24.539
Oh! Hey. How'd it go?

1074
00:47:24.564 --> 00:47:27.117
We have music! We're going to
Lanighan's for a bite.


1075
00:47:27.148 --> 00:47:28.327
Come join us.

1076
00:47:28.358 --> 00:47:30.028
Oh, uh...

1077
00:47:30.064 --> 00:47:32.628
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up later.


1078
00:47:33.307 --> 00:47:34.509
All right.

1079
00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:36.596
Well, I guess it's
just the two of us.


1080
00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:39.729
Hmm.

1081
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:49.894
Busy!

1082
00:47:51.273 --> 00:47:53.928
What's the celebration?
Free pint with every smile?


1083
00:47:53.959 --> 00:47:56.698
We'd be bankrupt
within the hour.


1084
00:47:56.722 --> 00:47:58.008
Word got out
that the band


1085
00:47:58.033 --> 00:48:00.030
were planning to
warm up their fingers.


1086
00:48:00.055 --> 00:48:01.432
They're playing the last stop

1087
00:48:01.457 --> 00:48:03.146
at the Twelve Pubs
party this year,


1088
00:48:03.177 --> 00:48:05.830
and apparently, they're
taking it quite seriously.


1089
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:06.995
So, I hope you weren't planning

1090
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.362
a quiet sit-down.

1091
00:48:08.397 --> 00:48:10.529
It's about to get a mite
livelier in here.


1092
00:48:10.564 --> 00:48:12.696
It's all right.
I left my knitting in the car.


1093
00:48:13.705 --> 00:48:15.227
I'd best pour you both a pint, so.

1094
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.529
You'll be needing to
cool down soon enough.


1095
00:48:26.989 --> 00:48:29.346
You don't see this
too often in New York, huh?


1096
00:48:29.975 --> 00:48:31.855
I haven't seen anything
like this anywhere.


1097
00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.078
It's amazing.

1098
00:48:40.863 --> 00:48:42.061
The only thing
better than watching...


1099
00:48:42.097 --> 00:48:43.356
Hey, you two, come on.

1100
00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:44.409
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.


1101
00:48:44.448 --> 00:48:45.564
I don't know the steps.

1102
00:48:45.604 --> 00:48:48.404
None of us do. So, just
smile and move your feet.


1103
00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:50.629
- Can you manage that?
- All right.


1104
00:48:55.251 --> 00:48:56.482
There you go.

1105
00:48:58.106 --> 00:48:59.280
Oh...

1106
00:49:00.237 --> 00:49:02.362
Okay, you go through.

1107
00:49:14.855 --> 00:49:16.485
Your Irish roots are showing!

1108
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.762
Aye. Yours are, too!

1109
00:49:36.197 --> 00:49:37.997
So, how are
your feet after last night?


1110
00:49:38.022 --> 00:49:41.093
Oh, I feel like I ran barefoot
through the Five Boroughs.


1111
00:49:41.993 --> 00:49:43.070
But worth it?

1112
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:45.271
Oh, that was the most
fun I've had in years,


1113
00:49:45.302 --> 00:49:47.126
maybe... maybe ever.

1114
00:49:47.162 --> 00:49:48.494
Where's Margot today?

1115
00:49:48.519 --> 00:49:49.742
She's having lunch
with the Duchess.


1116
00:49:49.767 --> 00:49:52.060
- Hmm.
- Yeah. She's hard not to love.


1117
00:49:52.495 --> 00:49:55.293
Must run in the family.

1118
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:57.126
So, why are we picking a tree?

1119
00:49:57.162 --> 00:49:59.379
I mean, there's almost one in
every room in the castle.


1120
00:49:59.404 --> 00:50:01.418
Almost every room.

1121
00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:04.741
Let's just say you've inspired
me the past few days.


1122
00:50:04.766 --> 00:50:06.895
It got me thinking
about Siobhan and I, and


1123
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.294
how, when we were young,

1124
00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:11.626
Tree Day was almost as
thrilling as Christmas itself.


1125
00:50:12.683 --> 00:50:14.276
Dad would bundle us up
and we'd trek out


1126
00:50:14.301 --> 00:50:16.226
to find the biggest, fullest, most

1127
00:50:16.262 --> 00:50:18.459
Christmassy smelling
Douglas fir in all the land.


1128
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.207
Most Christmassy smelling?

1129
00:50:20.232 --> 00:50:22.258
- Yeah.
- Yep.


1130
00:50:22.283 --> 00:50:24.016
Decorating the tree was...

1131
00:50:24.047 --> 00:50:26.708
it was one of our favorite
things to do as kids together. You know?


1132
00:50:26.739 --> 00:50:28.878
It's... pure joy.

1133
00:50:29.963 --> 00:50:31.321
And it was one of those moments,

1134
00:50:31.346 --> 00:50:34.020
where we just felt like
a normal family.


1135
00:50:34.045 --> 00:50:36.651
So, I thought this
might be something


1136
00:50:36.676 --> 00:50:38.806
that can mend a few fences.

1137
00:50:40.335 --> 00:50:41.770
Care to give us a hand?

1138
00:50:41.795 --> 00:50:44.137
I'd love to.

1139
00:50:44.162 --> 00:50:45.269
Have you
had any breakthroughs


1140
00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.177
on the O'Reilly family tree?

1141
00:50:47.202 --> 00:50:51.760
Oh, as much as it pains me to say,
no, not as of yet.


1142
00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:53.251
Oh. That's why you invited me.

1143
00:50:53.279 --> 00:50:54.946
Not today. Ladies,

1144
00:50:54.971 --> 00:50:57.695
may I to present
Miss Margot Monaghan from...


1145
00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.146
Ladies, I hope you've saved

1146
00:50:59.171 --> 00:51:02.945
all your juiciest
gossip for... hello.


1147
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.284
Hi.

1148
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:06.734
Margot, this is my son,
Cillian Dunlevy,


1149
00:51:06.759 --> 00:51:08.510
the Marquess of Castleblayney.

1150
00:51:08.545 --> 00:51:10.630
Please, please, call me
Cillian Dunlevy,


1151
00:51:10.655 --> 00:51:12.110
the Marquess of Castleblayney.

1152
00:51:13.151 --> 00:51:15.143
Margot is a friend
from New York.


1153
00:51:15.179 --> 00:51:17.233
She'll be joining us
for lunch today.


1154
00:51:17.265 --> 00:51:18.178
Will she now?

1155
00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:19.776
Indeed, she will.

1156
00:51:36.573 --> 00:51:38.001
Was I humming?

1157
00:51:38.033 --> 00:51:40.313
Oh, no.
I think I do that sometimes.


1158
00:51:40.338 --> 00:51:41.505
It's very charming.

1159
00:51:43.449 --> 00:51:45.992
I think we're about
ready for the crown.


1160
00:51:49.802 --> 00:51:51.176
Everything all right?

1161
00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:52.303
Y...

1162
00:51:52.994 --> 00:51:55.710
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
I just...


1163
00:51:58.208 --> 00:51:59.893
Just, for all of my husband's flaws,

1164
00:51:59.918 --> 00:52:02.143
Christmas was
really special for us,


1165
00:52:02.179 --> 00:52:04.218
especially decorating the tree.

1166
00:52:04.249 --> 00:52:06.934
And he was taller than me,
so he'd always did the star.


1167
00:52:08.019 --> 00:52:10.093
Oh, everything
just feels kind of off.


1168
00:52:10.118 --> 00:52:11.383
Oh, I know the feeling.

1169
00:52:11.408 --> 00:52:14.277
Christmas has been off for me
for the last few years, too.


1170
00:52:14.302 --> 00:52:16.643
Well, how would you be spending
it if you weren't here?


1171
00:52:16.678 --> 00:52:19.344
Room service and watching
<i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>.


1172
00:52:20.615 --> 00:52:22.551
Kind of sounds like
"It's a Lonely Life".


1173
00:52:23.526 --> 00:52:25.782
I suppose
I just came to accept it.


1174
00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.809
And now?

1175
00:52:27.834 --> 00:52:29.217
Now...

1176
00:52:29.242 --> 00:52:32.564
I'm starting to remember what Christmas
is supposed to feel like.


1177
00:52:35.382 --> 00:52:37.799
You know, it's inspiring
watching you work.


1178
00:52:37.824 --> 00:52:39.433
I mean, despite your setbacks,

1179
00:52:39.457 --> 00:52:42.653
you've... taken
something that you love


1180
00:52:42.678 --> 00:52:44.636
and built an entire
career that says,


1181
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:46.910
"This is me.
This is who I am."


1182
00:52:49.851 --> 00:52:51.762
Could you do this for me?

1183
00:52:51.787 --> 00:52:53.151
No.

1184
00:52:53.176 --> 00:52:55.743
But perhaps
we can do it together.


1185
00:53:14.696 --> 00:53:16.038
And for the final touch...

1186
00:53:16.063 --> 00:53:18.561
Oh, it's gonna be perfect.

1187
00:53:26.279 --> 00:53:27.476
Thank you.

1188
00:53:32.273 --> 00:53:34.007
This is our biggest
event of the year,


1189
00:53:34.032 --> 00:53:38.103
so it's obviously very exciting.
I think you'll really enjoy it.


1190
00:53:38.128 --> 00:53:39.085
Oh.

1191
00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:40.406
Yeah, so, I just...

1192
00:53:40.431 --> 00:53:42.286
I wanted to try something
different this year,


1193
00:53:42.311 --> 00:53:45.110
which is why I went for
a new event planner,


1194
00:53:45.145 --> 00:53:47.577
just to freshen up
the old (unclear).


1195
00:53:47.602 --> 00:53:50.402
Aiden, have you met Fiona Walsh?

1196
00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.207
She's covering the gala
for Lifestyle Ireland.


1197
00:53:52.232 --> 00:53:54.187
Oh. I haven't.
It's a pleasure.


1198
00:53:54.212 --> 00:53:56.243
- Nice to meet you.
- Have you seen Paige?


1199
00:53:56.268 --> 00:53:57.476
Fiona wants to interview her.

1200
00:53:57.511 --> 00:53:59.623
I have.
She's right...


1201
00:53:59.648 --> 00:54:02.421
Oh, that's odd.
She was right here.


1202
00:54:02.446 --> 00:54:05.179
Indeed.
I would like to speak to her.


1203
00:54:05.204 --> 00:54:08.453
I think the idea of a refined
New York sensibility


1204
00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:10.843
meets traditional
Irish aesthetic


1205
00:54:10.868 --> 00:54:12.241
is a good angle for the article.

1206
00:54:12.266 --> 00:54:13.286
Do have her call me.

1207
00:54:13.311 --> 00:54:14.952
Of course.
I'll make sure she's in touch.


1208
00:54:14.977 --> 00:54:16.409
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.


1209
00:54:16.445 --> 00:54:18.043
Bye.

1210
00:54:21.137 --> 00:54:22.110
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.


1211
00:54:22.145 --> 00:54:23.587
- Hey.
- We were just, uh...


1212
00:54:23.612 --> 00:54:25.092
Looking for spiders?

1213
00:54:25.117 --> 00:54:26.254
No. We were just, uh,

1214
00:54:26.279 --> 00:54:28.074
admiring the, um, architecture.

1215
00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:29.745
- Architecture, right.
- There's just so much of it.


1216
00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:30.491
So good.

1217
00:54:30.516 --> 00:54:32.670
Uh, Fiona Walsh
is looking for you.


1218
00:54:32.695 --> 00:54:33.864
She was just here.

1219
00:54:33.889 --> 00:54:36.270
Oh, that's too bad.
Bad timing.


1220
00:54:36.295 --> 00:54:39.621
Yeah, she'd like to feature you
in an article she's writing.


1221
00:54:39.646 --> 00:54:40.172
Really?

1222
00:54:40.197 --> 00:54:42.410
In fact, if we go now, we can
probably still catch her.


1223
00:54:42.435 --> 00:54:43.977
Oh, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.


1224
00:54:44.012 --> 00:54:45.916
I-I, um...
we've worked together before,


1225
00:54:45.941 --> 00:54:47.993
so I have her number;
I'll give her a ring.


1226
00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:49.710
Okay.

1227
00:54:52.278 --> 00:54:55.277
Uh... I-I just remember
I have a meeting.


1228
00:54:55.311 --> 00:54:57.817
It's a really boring one
about napkins and things.


1229
00:54:57.842 --> 00:54:59.321
So, I'm gonna just excuse
myself, please.


1230
00:54:59.346 --> 00:55:01.854
Right.
Um, so, architecture, right?


1231
00:55:01.879 --> 00:55:04.676
It's great.
Really nice. Really...


1232
00:55:04.712 --> 00:55:06.743
strong, sturdy

1233
00:55:07.723 --> 00:55:09.689
Jennifer!
What a surprise!


1234
00:55:09.714 --> 00:55:12.010
I was in the area and thought
I'd pop in to see the kitchen.


1235
00:55:12.045 --> 00:55:13.527
Is this a bad time?

1236
00:55:13.552 --> 00:55:15.110
Uh, no.
No, not at all.


1237
00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:18.141
The kitchen is just, uh...
this way.


1238
00:55:18.166 --> 00:55:19.265
Outside?

1239
00:55:19.289 --> 00:55:21.949
Medieval architecture,
am I right?


1240
00:55:21.974 --> 00:55:24.143
Yeah, it's just, um, this way.

1241
00:55:26.321 --> 00:55:28.541
Jennifer!

1242
00:55:28.566 --> 00:55:30.440
Don't tell me,
you're catering the gala.


1243
00:55:30.465 --> 00:55:31.634
I am indeed.

1244
00:55:31.659 --> 00:55:33.444
Fiona, what a lovely surprise.

1245
00:55:33.469 --> 00:55:35.244
It's been ages.
Have you met met Bro...


1246
00:55:35.268 --> 00:55:38.307
Broke!
Ah, I broke a nail! Oh!


1247
00:55:38.332 --> 00:55:39.658
A nail? Just now?

1248
00:55:39.683 --> 00:55:40.787
Yep.

1249
00:55:40.812 --> 00:55:42.140
May I have a look?
I have a nail...


1250
00:55:42.165 --> 00:55:44.253
No, thank you.
Thank you, thank you. No, no.


1251
00:55:44.278 --> 00:55:45.620
It's bad. It's...

1252
00:55:45.645 --> 00:55:46.621
It's a bad one,
I can feel it.


1253
00:55:46.646 --> 00:55:48.351
Oh, it's messy.

1254
00:55:48.376 --> 00:55:50.803
Uh, uh... we'll just...
we'll grab some bandages


1255
00:55:50.828 --> 00:55:52.509
on the way the way
to the kitchen.


1256
00:55:52.545 --> 00:55:53.776
Madam?

1257
00:55:53.812 --> 00:55:55.308
Oh, thanks.

1258
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:59.062
Jennifer, always a pleasure.

1259
00:55:59.087 --> 00:56:01.372
And... you take care
of that finger.


1260
00:56:02.284 --> 00:56:04.258
Thank you.

1261
00:56:04.283 --> 00:56:05.211
Good evening.

1262
00:56:05.235 --> 00:56:07.694
Were you expecting a car,
Ms. Monaghan?


1263
00:56:13.352 --> 00:56:15.520
- I can explain!
- I don't want to know.


1264
00:56:15.545 --> 00:56:17.743
Listen, the truth is...

1265
00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.680
The truth is,
when they hired me,


1266
00:56:20.705 --> 00:56:22.646
they thought I was Paige
and I didn't correct them


1267
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:25.051
because they were desperate.

1268
00:56:25.076 --> 00:56:26.791
But this party is
unbelievably important


1269
00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:29.436
and I'm just trying to
make sure it happens.


1270
00:56:29.461 --> 00:56:30.720
Please, don't say anything.

1271
00:56:30.745 --> 00:56:33.077
I'm... I'm... I'm
literally begging you.


1272
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:36.757
Fine.

1273
00:56:36.782 --> 00:56:38.787
But you can find yourself
another caterer.


1274
00:56:38.812 --> 00:56:41.518
What? But why?

1275
00:56:41.543 --> 00:56:43.020
Because, one day,
I hope to work with


1276
00:56:43.045 --> 00:56:45.851
the real Paige Monaghan again
and I don't want to risk that


1277
00:56:45.876 --> 00:56:49.604
by getting in the middle
of... well, whatever this is.


1278
00:56:49.629 --> 00:56:51.843
You're on your own... Brooke.

1279
00:57:00.804 --> 00:57:03.363
Three days to go
and she backs out?


1280
00:57:03.388 --> 00:57:04.893
I have half a mind
to ring her up myself...


1281
00:57:04.918 --> 00:57:06.274
No! Don't do that!
It was... it was...


1282
00:57:06.299 --> 00:57:07.836
It was my fault.

1283
00:57:07.861 --> 00:57:09.841
I gave her the
wrong date for the gala


1284
00:57:09.866 --> 00:57:11.511
and she's
triple booked that day.


1285
00:57:11.536 --> 00:57:12.609
I'm so sorry.

1286
00:57:13.425 --> 00:57:15.765
You're sure the castle
restaurant can't do it?


1287
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.404
Not for an event this big.

1288
00:57:17.429 --> 00:57:20.516
We could supplement,
but these caterers,


1289
00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:22.788
they bring in a
mobile kitchen and a full staff.


1290
00:57:22.813 --> 00:57:23.459
We're sunk.

1291
00:57:23.484 --> 00:57:26.698
No. No, not yet.
No. We'll figure it out.


1292
00:57:26.723 --> 00:57:28.809
We always do.
Don't we, Paige?


1293
00:57:30.758 --> 00:57:32.774
Paige?

1294
00:57:36.081 --> 00:57:37.657
I need some air.

1295
00:57:39.186 --> 00:57:43.189
It's all part of her process.
We'll get this all sorted.


1296
00:57:43.214 --> 00:57:44.759
Don't worry.

1297
00:57:52.244 --> 00:57:53.741
Hey, what are you doing?

1298
00:57:53.766 --> 00:57:55.309
What I should have
done a week ago.


1299
00:57:55.334 --> 00:57:57.253
Brooke, okay, I think
you're overreacting a bit.


1300
00:57:57.278 --> 00:57:59.151
So, we lost the caterer...

1301
00:58:00.486 --> 00:58:01.908
You don't get it, do you?

1302
00:58:02.562 --> 00:58:07.064
You don't get how ugly this is,
how just... awful I feel.


1303
00:58:07.089 --> 00:58:08.790
Margot, these people have
put their trust in us


1304
00:58:08.815 --> 00:58:10.952
and we're just
lying to their faces.


1305
00:58:10.977 --> 00:58:13.151
This is... it's not a game.

1306
00:58:13.176 --> 00:58:14.642
I know it's not.

1307
00:58:14.667 --> 00:58:15.250
Do you?

1308
00:58:15.275 --> 00:58:17.701
Because you just keep piling lie
on top of lie on top of lie,


1309
00:58:17.726 --> 00:58:19.153
like it's nothing.

1310
00:58:19.178 --> 00:58:21.916
I never should have let you
talk me into this, I knew it.


1311
00:58:21.941 --> 00:58:25.232
Okay, I messed up.
I know that.


1312
00:58:25.257 --> 00:58:27.910
I was trying to do
something good and...


1313
00:58:27.935 --> 00:58:29.322
I shouldn't have
gotten involved.


1314
00:58:29.347 --> 00:58:31.796
The point is
that they did trust us,


1315
00:58:31.821 --> 00:58:33.740
they trusted you.

1316
00:58:33.765 --> 00:58:36.776
And if you quit now,
it's them that suffers, not me.


1317
00:58:36.801 --> 00:58:39.882
Don't punish them
for my stupidity.


1318
00:58:39.907 --> 00:58:42.467
They need you, Brooke.

1319
00:58:55.547 --> 00:58:57.536
There's a trick I haven't seen.

1320
00:58:57.561 --> 00:59:00.533
You learn this from your elite
New York Academy of Design?


1321
00:59:00.558 --> 00:59:02.992
No, this is from my elite
academy of a childhood


1322
00:59:03.017 --> 00:59:06.636
spent throwing very lavish
parties for my Barbies.


1323
00:59:06.661 --> 00:59:08.626
I, um...

1324
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:11.708
Well, this has just
always been my passion,


1325
00:59:11.743 --> 00:59:14.141
just started on a
slightly smaller scale.


1326
00:59:16.995 --> 00:59:18.641
I hadn't heard
from you this morning.


1327
00:59:18.677 --> 00:59:20.896
I was worried maybe you'd...

1328
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:23.933
What? Quit?
No. No, no, no.


1329
00:59:23.965 --> 00:59:27.623
Just...
Just a little preoccupied.


1330
00:59:27.648 --> 00:59:30.933
Paige, what happened
with the caterer,


1331
00:59:30.958 --> 00:59:33.562
it wasn't your fault.

1332
00:59:33.587 --> 00:59:36.718
It's an honest mistake.

1333
00:59:36.743 --> 00:59:38.141
Um...

1334
00:59:41.314 --> 00:59:44.840
Aiden, there's you need to
know something about me.


1335
00:59:44.865 --> 00:59:46.760
Um...

1336
00:59:46.785 --> 00:59:49.789
I'm...

1337
00:59:49.814 --> 00:59:51.349
I'm, um...

1338
00:59:53.316 --> 00:59:54.962
I'm not p...

1339
00:59:54.987 --> 00:59:57.779
Perfect?
I'm happy to hear,


1340
00:59:57.804 --> 00:59:59.942
because frankly,
I was beginning to wonder.


1341
01:00:01.355 --> 01:00:02.374
Who was it who told me

1342
01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:03.908
that we're not defined
by our mistakes?


1343
01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:05.985
Aiden...

1344
01:00:06.009 --> 01:00:09.001
I mean, look what you've
accomplished in a week.


1345
01:00:09.026 --> 01:00:10.674
I believe in you.

1346
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:16.900
I can fix this. I...
I'm going to fix this.


1347
01:00:16.925 --> 01:00:18.305
We can do it together.

1348
01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:19.569
Great.

1349
01:00:19.594 --> 01:00:20.521
Worst case scenario,

1350
01:00:20.546 --> 01:00:21.958
we back up a
truckload of sausages


1351
01:00:21.982 --> 01:00:24.292
and have the lads
fire up the grills.


1352
01:00:25.854 --> 01:00:27.930
You know what?
That's not entirely off base.


1353
01:00:28.538 --> 01:00:32.018
Are you daft? I can't cater
the Christmas gala.


1354
01:00:32.043 --> 01:00:33.844
Clara, we're desperate.

1355
01:00:33.869 --> 01:00:35.241
Oh, such flattery.

1356
01:00:35.276 --> 01:00:36.474
We really are desperate.

1357
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:37.772
But why me?

1358
01:00:37.797 --> 01:00:39.978
The Duchess and her friends
aren't exactly the cottage pie


1359
01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.203
and colcannon types.

1360
01:00:42.228 --> 01:00:43.655
Meat and potatoes.

1361
01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.778
Oh. But it doesn't
have to be fancy.


1362
01:00:45.803 --> 01:00:47.441
No, it just has to be delicious,

1363
01:00:47.476 --> 01:00:49.735
and your food is
most definitely that.


1364
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.241
What's your most popular dish?

1365
01:00:52.075 --> 01:00:55.041
Steak and onion pie
with a side of green beans.


1366
01:00:56.479 --> 01:00:57.999
Okay, so, we... we serve it

1367
01:00:58.024 --> 01:01:01.316
on very fancy plates,
we call it...


1368
01:01:01.341 --> 01:01:05.298
tourtière with haricots verts,
and no one knows the difference.


1369
01:01:06.391 --> 01:01:07.675
Well, even if I said yes,

1370
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:10.378
I don't have the
space or the help.


1371
01:01:10.403 --> 01:01:12.107
What if we told you we
already figured that part out,


1372
01:01:12.143 --> 01:01:13.759
would that be a yes?

1373
01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:18.668
All right, this is great.
We have dinner sorted out.


1374
01:01:18.693 --> 01:01:21.066
Now, we just need
appetizers and desserts.


1375
01:01:22.409 --> 01:01:23.922
I have an idea.

1376
01:01:28.809 --> 01:01:30.383
Are you planning on telling me

1377
01:01:30.408 --> 01:01:32.280
what we bought all these
ingredients for?


1378
01:01:32.305 --> 01:01:35.489
No.
I'm planning on showing you.


1379
01:01:36.176 --> 01:01:39.382
So, plum pudding, is that
kind of like a fruitcake?


1380
01:01:39.407 --> 01:01:40.641
Similar.

1381
01:01:40.677 --> 01:01:43.770
If Christmas could be summed up
in a taste, this is be it.


1382
01:01:43.795 --> 01:01:45.175
And he bakes?

1383
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.652
Oh, you've been
holding out on me.


1384
01:01:46.677 --> 01:01:48.274
No, I can't really.

1385
01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:50.263
These recipes have been
handed down for generations


1386
01:01:50.288 --> 01:01:55.343
and each family has a custodian
of theirs and I'm him.


1387
01:01:55.368 --> 01:01:59.254
Let's, as they say
in America, do this.


1388
01:02:03.508 --> 01:02:05.074
I think that must be enough.

1389
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:07.307
Lot of butter,
lot of sugar.


1390
01:02:07.343 --> 01:02:09.907
I wasn't very
successful with this.


1391
01:02:18.343 --> 01:02:20.408
- Oh...
- Look at that, huh?


1392
01:02:20.443 --> 01:02:22.456
- Vey fancy.
- Ta-da.


1393
01:02:22.481 --> 01:02:24.464
You wanna give me that? Okay.

1394
01:02:26.063 --> 01:02:27.521
There we go.

1395
01:02:27.546 --> 01:02:28.568
- Like that?
- Mm-hmm.


1396
01:02:28.593 --> 01:02:30.245
That's very nice.

1397
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.314
- Look at that.
- Perfect.


1398
01:02:31.339 --> 01:02:32.666
We did it.

1399
01:02:38.707 --> 01:02:39.782
Now what?

1400
01:02:39.807 --> 01:02:42.592
Now, we, uh, make ten more.

1401
01:02:42.617 --> 01:02:45.019
Let's do this.

1402
01:02:45.044 --> 01:02:45.675
I knew it.

1403
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:47.859
- I knew it!
- That's an American saying,


1404
01:02:47.884 --> 01:02:49.940
"Let's do this."

1405
01:02:52.248 --> 01:02:54.627
Now, technically you're not supposed
to try it out of the oven,


1406
01:02:54.652 --> 01:02:58.295
but there's also something
to be said for quality control.


1407
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.940
The recipe also says you can't
eat the first bite yourself.


1408
01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:08.969
Mmm. Wow.

1409
01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.756
Yup, that is...

1410
01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:14.932
You know, you're...

1411
01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.900
You're unexpected.

1412
01:03:18.477 --> 01:03:19.641
Fine. When I first met you,

1413
01:03:19.677 --> 01:03:23.518
I kind of thought you were...
you know...


1414
01:03:23.543 --> 01:03:27.974
and now I realize I was wrong.

1415
01:03:27.999 --> 01:03:30.589
But...

1416
01:03:30.614 --> 01:03:32.657
Yeah. No, I was wrong.

1417
01:03:32.682 --> 01:03:35.907
You're... so kind and thoughtful

1418
01:03:35.942 --> 01:03:38.374
and... authentic.

1419
01:03:41.587 --> 01:03:44.442
Paige...

1420
01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:46.160
I, um...

1421
01:03:47.612 --> 01:03:49.866
I-I just realized that
I-I don't have a...


1422
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:51.615
a dress for tomorrow.

1423
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.809
So, I mean, we should
probably get this cleaned up,


1424
01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:54.986
you know, so I can, um...

1425
01:03:55.011 --> 01:03:56.307
- Yeah.
- I can find something to wear.


1426
01:03:56.343 --> 01:03:59.641
- Right.
- Yeah.


1427
01:03:59.677 --> 01:04:01.241
[Answering machine]
You have one new message.


1428
01:04:02.394 --> 01:04:04.711
Paige,
this is Fiona Walsh


1429
01:04:04.736 --> 01:04:06.225
with Lifestyle Ireland.

1430
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.332
I've been trying to connect
with you at Castle Hart


1431
01:04:08.357 --> 01:04:10.272
about the Duchess's Christmas
gala that you're planning,


1432
01:04:10.297 --> 01:04:12.808
but we seem to keep
missing each other.


1433
01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:14.274
So, if you could give me a ring

1434
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:16.474
at your earliest
convenience, thanks.


1435
01:04:20.675 --> 01:04:22.472
Okay, appetizers
are over there, please.


1436
01:04:22.508 --> 01:04:24.972
And then, main courses are here.

1437
01:04:25.007 --> 01:04:28.439
And that's great, thank you.
Oh, desserts over there, please.


1438
01:04:28.474 --> 01:04:30.606
Tourtière with haricots verts.

1439
01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:33.293
Oh, C'est magnifique, Clara.
Thank you!


1440
01:04:33.318 --> 01:04:34.406
Listen, you haven't...

1441
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:35.905
you haven't seen Margot,
by chance, have you?


1442
01:04:35.941 --> 01:04:37.205
No, I haven't.

1443
01:04:39.634 --> 01:04:40.841
Great. Thank you.

1444
01:04:40.866 --> 01:04:42.012
Everything going smoothly?

1445
01:04:42.037 --> 01:04:43.573
Yes, I think we're done,

1446
01:04:43.608 --> 01:04:45.372
other than...
other than the guests.


1447
01:04:45.408 --> 01:04:47.476
Then, you deserve a break.
Come on.


1448
01:04:47.501 --> 01:04:49.436
- Come on, where?
- Come on.


1449
01:04:52.191 --> 01:04:55.939
Oh, Aiden, this is so beautiful.
When did you do this?


1450
01:04:55.974 --> 01:04:59.604
Over the last few days.
I got inspired.


1451
01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.979
So, does this mean
you're staying?


1452
01:05:01.004 --> 01:05:05.231
Well, I haven't talked to
Siobhan yet, but I'd like to.


1453
01:05:05.256 --> 01:05:07.432
It's... starting to feel
like home again.


1454
01:05:07.457 --> 01:05:09.804
I'm really happy
for you, really.


1455
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:11.705
If I haven't thanked you yet...

1456
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.422
I'm just doing my job.

1457
01:05:13.447 --> 01:05:15.205
Well, not for the gala. It's...

1458
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:17.293
It's more than that.

1459
01:05:17.318 --> 01:05:20.048
You've inspired me
with your wisdom,


1460
01:05:20.073 --> 01:05:21.782
and your heart,

1461
01:05:21.807 --> 01:05:24.723
for extending yourself
when you didn't have to,


1462
01:05:24.748 --> 01:05:27.039
and for teaching me
the value of family,


1463
01:05:27.074 --> 01:05:29.039
of loyalty.

1464
01:05:29.074 --> 01:05:30.972
You know, I see what
you have with your sister


1465
01:05:31.007 --> 01:05:33.987
and I want that with mine.

1466
01:05:34.012 --> 01:05:36.446
It's what you do,

1467
01:05:36.471 --> 01:05:38.319
it's who you are.

1468
01:05:38.344 --> 01:05:41.254
The truth is...

1469
01:05:41.279 --> 01:05:43.339
I've never met a woman like you.

1470
01:05:46.031 --> 01:05:49.672
And I'm not sure I'm ready
to say goodbye just yet.


1471
01:05:50.907 --> 01:05:52.905
Aiden, I...

1472
01:05:54.974 --> 01:05:57.239
Sorry. I'm...
I'm so sorry.


1473
01:05:57.274 --> 01:06:00.150
I...
I have to get ready...


1474
01:06:05.777 --> 01:06:07.727
Beg pardon, Miss Monaghan.

1475
01:06:07.752 --> 01:06:09.406
I left the packages in the room.

1476
01:06:43.802 --> 01:06:46.072
"For you selection...

1477
01:06:46.107 --> 01:06:48.105
"Aiden."

1478
01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.411
Hey.

1479
01:07:08.176 --> 01:07:10.368
Hey, what is it?
What happened?


1480
01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:11.688
It's this.

1481
01:07:11.713 --> 01:07:14.301
It's... all of this.

1482
01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:16.520
He's been so nice to me,

1483
01:07:16.545 --> 01:07:20.241
and all I want to do is just...
tell him how much I like him,


1484
01:07:20.266 --> 01:07:22.326
which I really think is a lot,

1485
01:07:22.351 --> 01:07:24.183
and I can't because
I'm not who I said I was,


1486
01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:25.947
and if I do tell him,
it's gonna ruin everything.


1487
01:07:25.972 --> 01:07:27.939
And then, I said all
of that stuff to you,


1488
01:07:27.966 --> 01:07:29.241
and I know you're
just trying to help,


1489
01:07:29.266 --> 01:07:33.439
and I-I could find you, and I-I
got so worried that... that you...


1490
01:07:33.474 --> 01:07:36.339
I had what?
Abandoned my sister?


1491
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.129
Never. Come on. Never.

1492
01:07:40.154 --> 01:07:42.638
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.


1493
01:07:42.674 --> 01:07:45.212
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1494
01:07:45.237 --> 01:07:48.443
Look, and if Aiden likes you
half as much as I do,


1495
01:07:48.467 --> 01:07:51.316
then your name could be
Candycane McChristmas


1496
01:07:51.341 --> 01:07:53.654
and he wouldn't care.

1497
01:07:53.679 --> 01:07:55.381
We'll explain everything
when the time is right


1498
01:07:55.406 --> 01:07:58.605
and he'll completely understand,
I promise, I promise.


1499
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:03.072
If you need a dress, there

1500
01:08:03.107 --> 01:08:04.406
are a few to choose from.

1501
01:08:04.441 --> 01:08:05.620
No, I'm good.

1502
01:08:05.645 --> 01:08:07.772
I went shopping this
morning with Cillian.


1503
01:08:07.807 --> 01:08:08.680
Oh...

1504
01:08:08.705 --> 01:08:11.558
Now, get your glass slippers...

1505
01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:13.035
which ones?

1506
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.376
And let's blow the
doors off this thing. Yeah?


1507
01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:17.194
I love you.

1508
01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:20.105
Oh, I love you, too.

1509
01:08:35.248 --> 01:08:40.631
It's perfect,
beyond my expectations.


1510
01:08:40.656 --> 01:08:41.949
Oh, is Paige around?

1511
01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:44.172
I believe a
thank you is in order.


1512
01:08:45.963 --> 01:08:48.239
Aiden, have you seen Paige?

1513
01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:50.838
I haven't, but I'll go
check out and see if she's...


1514
01:09:06.974 --> 01:09:09.136
Excuse me.

1515
01:09:14.653 --> 01:09:17.838
Hi.

1516
01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:21.572
Do I have something on my face?

1517
01:09:21.597 --> 01:09:24.136
Only a smile that
lights up the room.


1518
01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:26.679
You look... stunning.

1519
01:09:26.704 --> 01:09:29.705
Thank you, and thank you
for the... the dress.


1520
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.642
It's perfect.

1521
01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.687
Yes, it is.

1522
01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:36.705
Well, I suppose I'd better
let you show it off...


1523
01:09:41.868 --> 01:09:44.372
Not only does she throw

1524
01:09:44.408 --> 01:09:45.847
a truly magnificent party,

1525
01:09:45.872 --> 01:09:48.884
she outshines
everyone in the room.


1526
01:09:48.909 --> 01:09:49.696
Thank you.

1527
01:09:49.721 --> 01:09:51.336
I couldn't have done any of
this without my incredible...


1528
01:09:51.361 --> 01:09:54.144
Well, what did we miss?

1529
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:57.398
...my extraordinary sister.

1530
01:09:57.422 --> 01:09:59.911
Well, you are quite the team.

1531
01:09:59.936 --> 01:10:02.627
You have outdone
yourselves, ladies.


1532
01:10:02.652 --> 01:10:04.638
Thank you.

1533
01:10:04.674 --> 01:10:06.072
Well, I suppose I'd
better go and mingle,


1534
01:10:06.107 --> 01:10:08.675
but please, eat, drink, enjoy.

1535
01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.939
You've earned it, all of you.

1536
01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:13.438
You don't have to
tell me twice. Shall we?


1537
01:10:13.473 --> 01:10:14.772
Yes!

1538
01:10:17.777 --> 01:10:18.738
- I, um...
- Yeah.


1539
01:10:18.763 --> 01:10:20.105
- I should...
- Yeah.


1540
01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:22.172
Yeah.

1541
01:10:27.986 --> 01:10:29.475
Oh, Clara,
the food is such a hit!


1542
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.608
Everyone's loving it!

1543
01:10:30.633 --> 01:10:32.415
We can barely keep up
with seconds!


1544
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.705
Thank you.

1545
01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:41.894
Oh, Liam, the tree is just...
oh, it's so beautiful.


1546
01:10:41.919 --> 01:10:43.872
Well, I designed it
to represent


1547
01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:46.349
a new beginning
in our community.


1548
01:10:46.373 --> 01:10:50.438
The brightness of the palace
and the strength of our people.


1549
01:10:50.473 --> 01:10:52.522
Oh, thank you so much, Liam.

1550
01:10:52.547 --> 01:10:53.944
You're welcome.

1551
01:10:59.127 --> 01:11:00.811
What?

1552
01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:02.356
We did it.

1553
01:11:02.381 --> 01:11:04.465
Not bad for a couple
waitresses from New York.


1554
01:11:04.497 --> 01:11:05.854
Event planners from New York.

1555
01:11:05.879 --> 01:11:08.072
Event planners
from New York.


1556
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:13.283
Is it me or does she seem...

1557
01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:14.500
- Bored?
- Yeah.


1558
01:11:14.525 --> 01:11:15.937
It is a bit of a snoozer.

1559
01:11:15.962 --> 01:11:17.505
Well, this is what she wanted.

1560
01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:19.862
I think it's what
she's supposed to want.


1561
01:11:19.887 --> 01:11:23.306
But she's gonna love
what you've planned next.


1562
01:11:24.133 --> 01:11:25.371
Let's do it.

1563
01:11:56.538 --> 01:11:58.809
- They're amazing.
- It's so good!


1564
01:12:15.386 --> 01:12:19.180
Reminds me of the old community
parties we used to have.


1565
01:12:19.205 --> 01:12:21.261
Indeed.

1566
01:12:21.286 --> 01:12:25.139
And I believe it's time we got
back to doing those again.


1567
01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:35.039
Is she... oh!
She's dancing!


1568
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:53.605
You are just full
of surprises, aren't you?


1569
01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.672
Have you been keeping
anything else from me?


1570
01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:01.066
Actually, can I talk
to you in private?


1571
01:13:01.091 --> 01:13:02.589
Hmm?

1572
01:13:20.907 --> 01:13:23.809
I have to
tell you something.


1573
01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:26.470
I know, earlier,
in the chapel,


1574
01:13:26.495 --> 01:13:28.605
I
-I overstepped.

1575
01:13:31.435 --> 01:13:33.672
I'm not who you think I am.

1576
01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:37.779
I'm...

1577
01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:42.134
Brooke Bennet.

1578
01:13:42.159 --> 01:13:44.584
Her name is Brooke Bennett.

1579
01:13:44.609 --> 01:13:49.329
She's been lying to us.
This is the real Paige Monaghan.


1580
01:13:49.354 --> 01:13:52.500
Brooke is a waitress
she fired two weeks ago.


1581
01:13:55.154 --> 01:13:56.965
Is this true?

1582
01:13:59.321 --> 01:14:00.672
Yeah.

1583
01:14:03.497 --> 01:14:05.571
I trusted you.

1584
01:14:05.596 --> 01:14:09.053
I...

1585
01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:11.097
shared things.

1586
01:14:11.122 --> 01:14:13.704
I know.

1587
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:18.183
I know.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.


1588
01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:21.219
You needed help
with the gala, and I, um...


1589
01:14:21.244 --> 01:14:22.618
I knew if you'd
known who I really was,


1590
01:14:22.643 --> 01:14:26.746
you wouldn't have hired us,
so I-I went along with it.


1591
01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:28.986
But...

1592
01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:30.872
I've... I've wanted to tell you.

1593
01:14:30.907 --> 01:14:34.542
I... promise.
I was... desperate to tell you.


1594
01:14:34.567 --> 01:14:35.932
I was trying to
tell you, I swear.


1595
01:14:35.957 --> 01:14:37.352
It was my fault,

1596
01:14:37.377 --> 01:14:39.483
not hers.
She had nothing to do with it.


1597
01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:41.405
I'm so sorry.

1598
01:14:43.363 --> 01:14:45.430
You could have told me.

1599
01:14:45.455 --> 01:14:49.199
Aiden...

1600
01:14:49.224 --> 01:14:50.479
You!

1601
01:14:50.504 --> 01:14:53.322
Give me one reason I shouldn't
have both of you thrown in jail.


1602
01:14:53.347 --> 01:14:58.204
These young ladies are among
the finest I've ever met,


1603
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.142
regardless of what
their names are.


1604
01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:02.952
You breathe one word of this

1605
01:15:02.977 --> 01:15:04.545
and I'll make
sure you never work


1606
01:15:04.570 --> 01:15:06.495
in this part of the world again.

1607
01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.533
How's that for one?

1608
01:15:56.493 --> 01:15:58.560
Are you sure
you want to do this?


1609
01:15:58.585 --> 01:16:00.542
What if this is your fairytale?

1610
01:16:00.567 --> 01:16:03.041
If we drive away now,
you're never going to know.


1611
01:16:15.732 --> 01:16:16.754
- Aiden.
- Hey.


1612
01:16:16.779 --> 01:16:18.563
I got your note.

1613
01:16:18.588 --> 01:16:21.701
And the tree in the parlor...

1614
01:16:21.726 --> 01:16:24.504
you did that? For me?

1615
01:16:24.529 --> 01:16:26.557
Well, I was meaning
to wait until Christmas,


1616
01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:27.648
but after last night,

1617
01:16:27.673 --> 01:16:30.019
I figured we could both
use a little cheering up.


1618
01:16:32.949 --> 01:16:34.786
This is for you.

1619
01:16:37.822 --> 01:16:40.315
It's just a rough sketch, but...

1620
01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:43.813
I've added an annex
on the back for receptions,


1621
01:16:43.838 --> 01:16:46.793
we can do baptisms, weddings.

1622
01:16:46.818 --> 01:16:50.052
It should significantly
increase hotel traffic.


1623
01:16:50.088 --> 01:16:52.482
It's... wonderful.

1624
01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.670
But what...

1625
01:16:53.695 --> 01:16:55.286
I'm done,

1626
01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:59.827
done with running away,
done with hiding,


1627
01:16:59.852 --> 01:17:01.342
and most importantly,

1628
01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:04.963
I'm done with not having
my sister in my life.


1629
01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:07.086
If you're agreeable,

1630
01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:08.786
I'd like to come home.

1631
01:17:12.886 --> 01:17:15.264
When you left, 
I was so angry.

1632
01:17:15.289 --> 01:17:17.786
I blamed all
my struggles on you.


1633
01:17:17.822 --> 01:17:20.847
I was angry, not because
I felt betrayed;


1634
01:17:20.872 --> 01:17:23.719
I just...
wanted my brother back.


1635
01:17:23.744 --> 01:17:25.942
Your brother the Earl?

1636
01:17:25.966 --> 01:17:28.126
My brother the man.

1637
01:17:28.151 --> 01:17:30.251
Titles mean nothing.

1638
01:17:30.276 --> 01:17:33.153
All that matters
is what's underneath.


1639
01:17:42.207 --> 01:17:45.109
That goes for
someone else I could think of.


1640
01:17:45.134 --> 01:17:46.547
She lied to me.

1641
01:17:46.572 --> 01:17:48.286
Aye, she did,

1642
01:17:48.321 --> 01:17:49.833
but she was right.

1643
01:17:49.858 --> 01:17:52.720
Had we known who she was,
would we have hired her?


1644
01:17:54.547 --> 01:17:55.950
No, not likely.

1645
01:17:55.975 --> 01:17:58.262
And where would we be now?

1646
01:17:58.287 --> 01:18:01.866
She did it not to spite us,
but to help us.


1647
01:18:01.891 --> 01:18:03.981
If that doesn't
speak of character,


1648
01:18:04.006 --> 01:18:06.286
I don't know what does.

1649
01:18:07.715 --> 01:18:10.279
Thank you for this.

1650
01:18:12.384 --> 01:18:14.716
Welcome home, brother.

1651
01:18:26.257 --> 01:18:28.453
Did you forget something?

1652
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:34.935
I think I did.

1653
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:37.340
Aiden, I...

1654
01:18:37.365 --> 01:18:40.119
- Me first.
- No, me first.


1655
01:18:41.688 --> 01:18:43.486
I'm so sorry.

1656
01:18:43.522 --> 01:18:44.817
There's no excuse
for what I did.


1657
01:18:44.842 --> 01:18:48.153
I-I wanted nothing more than
to tell you the truth.


1658
01:18:48.188 --> 01:18:52.005
I mean, my whole life, I've...
I've just wanted to be seen


1659
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:54.292
and here I am,
living someone else's identity,


1660
01:18:54.317 --> 01:18:56.836
and it just makes me sick inside

1661
01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:58.170
to think that you think
none of it was real,


1662
01:18:58.195 --> 01:19:00.453
because the truth is...

1663
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:07.722
...all of those moments
of sharing, and of...


1664
01:19:07.747 --> 01:19:10.744
honesty and joy,

1665
01:19:10.769 --> 01:19:12.386
they've all been real.

1666
01:19:13.888 --> 01:19:16.862
And I...

1667
01:19:16.887 --> 01:19:19.119
I, uh...
I...


1668
01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:22.068
From the moment I met you,

1669
01:19:22.093 --> 01:19:24.487
I knew there was something
different about you.


1670
01:19:24.512 --> 01:19:29.153
I have waited my whole
life to meet you,


1671
01:19:29.188 --> 01:19:33.986
and yet, I don't think we've
properly done that yet.


1672
01:19:39.116 --> 01:19:41.081
Aiden Hart.

1673
01:19:43.907 --> 01:19:46.806
Brooke Bennett.

1674
01:19:47.854 --> 01:19:50.343
It's lovely to meet you, Brooke.

1675
01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:52.468
Very nice to meet you, too.

1676
01:19:52.493 --> 01:19:54.253
And if it's all right...

1677
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.153
...I'd really like
to see more of you.


1678
01:20:33.399 --> 01:20:35.053
I wonder why
she called us out here.


1679
01:20:35.078 --> 01:20:36.107
I don't know. She just called

1680
01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:38.553
and said to meet here here.
I'm not sure.


1681
01:20:41.274 --> 01:20:44.724
Come.
It appears they're home.


1682
01:20:44.749 --> 01:20:46.470
Who's home?

1683
01:20:48.634 --> 01:20:50.253
"Freedom".

1684
01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.599
Well, at first, I thought
it was just a meaningless word.


1685
01:20:52.624 --> 01:20:54.261
But then, it occurred to me

1686
01:20:54.286 --> 01:20:56.875
that all Irish names
have a meaning,


1687
01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:02.157
and the name meaning
"freedom" is "Saoirse".


1688
01:21:02.182 --> 01:21:03.785
Oh...

1689
01:21:06.514 --> 01:21:08.098
Your Grace!

1690
01:21:08.123 --> 01:21:10.329
My lord!

1691
01:21:10.354 --> 01:21:11.463
Is there something wrong?

1692
01:21:11.488 --> 01:21:15.872
No, not in the least.
You are Patrick O'Reilly?


1693
01:21:15.897 --> 01:21:18.852
Mother Saoirse.
Four children.


1694
01:21:18.888 --> 01:21:22.452
First born in America,
then put up for adoption.


1695
01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:24.799
A boy, aye.

1696
01:21:24.824 --> 01:21:26.283
What's this about?

1697
01:21:26.308 --> 01:21:28.647
Do you recall the date of birth?

1698
01:21:28.672 --> 01:21:30.353
Aye.
We celebrate it every year.


1699
01:21:30.378 --> 01:21:31.466
It's the 12th January...

1700
01:21:31.491 --> 01:21:34.286
January 1951.

1701
01:21:35.734 --> 01:21:38.747
That was our father, John.

1702
01:21:38.772 --> 01:21:42.620
Oh, that's impossible.
That would make me your uncle...


1703
01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:51.390
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness! Oh!


1704
01:21:51.415 --> 01:21:52.928
Oh, my goodness!

1705
01:21:52.953 --> 01:21:55.453
Well, if that's
the case, well...


1706
01:21:55.488 --> 01:21:58.694
come, come in!

1707
01:21:58.719 --> 01:22:02.043
Now, listen!
Listen, listen, listen, listen!


1708
01:22:02.068 --> 01:22:05.041
Erm, this is, uh...

1709
01:22:05.066 --> 01:22:06.181
Brooke and Margot.

1710
01:22:06.206 --> 01:22:06.867
Right.

1711
01:22:06.892 --> 01:22:10.363
Now, you lot, you never
met your eldest uncle.


1712
01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:11.629
None of us did.

1713
01:22:11.654 --> 01:22:13.338
His name was John

1714
01:22:13.363 --> 01:22:18.106
and... these are his girls.

1715
01:22:18.131 --> 01:22:20.939
We found our family.

1716
01:22:20.964 --> 01:22:24.271
And this is your Aunt Clara.

1717
01:22:24.296 --> 01:22:25.119
What?!

1718
01:22:25.155 --> 01:22:26.852
What?

1719
01:22:28.534 --> 01:22:30.620
It's a real
Christmas miracle!


1720
01:22:32.787 --> 01:22:35.504
Welcome home, girls.

1721
01:22:35.529 --> 01:22:38.652
You're just in time for tea.

1722
01:22:44.998 --> 01:22:47.962
- So nice to meet you.
- Hi!


1723
01:22:49.146 --> 01:22:50.697
Hi!

1724
01:22:50.722 --> 01:22:51.786
I'm Margot!
