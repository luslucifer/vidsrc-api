March 1909 Russia late winter

8
00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:06.389
For the day when I live
under the sky of my country


9
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.956
Countless comrades struggle
under the sun of other countries


10
00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:14.089
Disappearing in the brich trees

11
00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:17.789
Their earnest wish

12
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.423
It is able to move the heavens

13
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.589
Passionate patriotism

14
00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:26.223
With the earnestness of the heart

15
00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:30.323
One finger of mine, Ahn Jung-geun

16
00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:33.557
will be dedicated to the lush
birch forest of the motherland


17
00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:42.489
the land of the subjugant

18
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.356
We have gathered

19
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.789
with earnest prayerful hearts,

20
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.956
with fiery hearts,

21
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.656
and I vow at this moment

22
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.089
Even if it's a little thing,

23
00:04:10.424 --> 00:04:15.956
it's the beginning of a resolution

24
00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:22.989
Fighting with hot blood

25
00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:54.356
I swear at this moment today

26
00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:59.923
For the sake of my country, our passion

27
00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:05.723
We are gathered here to
share the moments together


28
00:05:05.724 --> 00:05:10.456
Never give in to defeat

29
00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:16.323
Just like the sunlight
that falls on the earth


30
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.956
Just like this wind that blows the trees

31
00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:24.689
You and I have a promise

32
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:32.690
We remember in our hearts forever

33
00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:44.623
As if our cheering

34
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.823
Awakening the Sleeping Forest

35
00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:56.489
Wake up this dim world

36
00:05:56.816 --> 00:06:04.816
Don't forget Today

37
00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:16.989

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.889
2 years ago
ampo, South Pyongan Province


39
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.289
Where are you going this time?

40
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.556
On the recommendation of the Father Ferran

41
00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:30.223
I plan to go to Rome

42
00:06:31.236 --> 00:06:33.836
I think it will also help the
operation of the independent school


43
00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:35.900
It's your birthday soon

44
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.656
At least have a meal of
seaweed soup before you leave.


45
00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:41.618
But the train ticket is already booked

46
00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:52.678
What are you crying about?

47
00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:54.723
I'm just going on a trip

48
00:06:57.858 --> 00:06:59.733
What the hell is trip...

49
00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:01.596
You think I'm dumb?

50
00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:03.956
Where do you want to go
again to do something stupid?


51
00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.856
In order to get independent
funds, the rice store was lost


52
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:09.323
The school was ruined for
the independence movement


53
00:07:15.224 --> 00:07:18.789
What exactly has the country done for us?

54
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.489
Why do you have to fight to
the death for your country?


55
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.956
Is that what you
should say in these times?

56
00:07:26.447 --> 00:07:29.199
Now even selling scrap is not
enough to fill the independent funds


57
00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:31.956
Didn't you already take
those things to sell?


58
00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.010
You bastard

59
00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:25.804
Take care of your
body when you go out

60
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:29.232
Never go hungry

61
00:08:29.888 --> 00:08:31.589
And no messy food

62
00:08:32.302 --> 00:08:36.389
Remember to ask for god's
blessing when you are in trouble


63
00:08:37.324 --> 00:08:38.356
Here

64
00:08:38.933 --> 00:08:42.289
Mom, I'm not worried about anything else

65
00:08:42.724 --> 00:08:45.789
But I'm worried I'll
miss your nagging voice


66
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.156
You're the one with the sweet mouth

67
00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:51.792
I will prepare for your next birthday

68
00:08:51.817 --> 00:08:53.623
Until then you must
take care of you health

69
00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:54.924
Ok

70
00:08:55.496 --> 00:08:57.589
- Then I'll go
- Yeah


71
00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:08.463
Mom

72
00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:10.289
Hyun-saeng, dad should go

73
00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:13.323
Bun-doo, bye

74
00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:20.904
Goodbye

75
00:09:27.737 --> 00:09:28.737
Go

76
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.656
June 19081st domestic attack victory
(Gyeongheung, North Hamgyong Province)


77
00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:09.207
Someone's raiding!

78
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:34.489
July 19082nd domestic offensive victory
(Shin-Esan, North Hamgyong Province)


79
00:10:37.357 --> 00:10:39.756
Hyunin, North Hamgyong
Province, August 1908


80
00:10:39.757 --> 00:10:41.256
Raise the gun

81
00:10:43.457 --> 00:10:45.389
Mercy!

82
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.742
Align the gun

83
00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:50.968
Aiming

84
00:10:52.624 --> 00:10:52.956
Stop shooting

85
00:10:52.957 --> 00:10:53.957
Stop shooting

86
00:10:58.131 --> 00:10:59.423
What are you doing?

87
00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:02.666
Don't you know Elements of International
Law that you can't kill a prisoner of war?


88
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.723
Do you want us to leave those beasts
who killed our comrades alive?


89
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:07.348
Do you want to
become a beast like them?

90
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:10.789
To be a person should follow
the morality and ethic


91
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.290
Set them free

92
00:11:16.884 --> 00:11:19.101
Thank you

93
00:11:25.428 --> 00:11:26.545
Bye

94
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.590
Come here

95
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.689
Can I have one more?

96
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.090
No

97
00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:53.389
One is not enough to eat

98
00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.323
Hey, you go around to see

99
00:11:55.457 --> 00:11:57.189
There is no one here
who has enough to eat

100
00:11:57.537 --> 00:11:58.537
Shit

101
00:11:59.662 --> 00:12:00.826
Shit

102
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.723
Be careful I stick you in both eyes

103
00:12:05.957 --> 00:12:07.389
You're a strange-looking girl

104
00:12:08.293 --> 00:12:10.389
Hey, what did you say?

105
00:12:18.093 --> 00:12:19.093
Thanks

106
00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:24.056
He's too young

107
00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:26.923
There are plenty of people like him here

108
00:12:26.924 --> 00:12:28.556
Doo-shik, it's been hard for you.

109
00:12:28.845 --> 00:12:30.456
Not really

110
00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:32.589
But will it be okay?

111
00:12:32.743 --> 00:12:33.743
What do you mean?

112
00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:35.889
I see a lot of discontent
among the volunteer soldiers


113
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.056
For releasing the beasts

114
00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:40.023
Would it be okay to kill them?

115
00:12:40.124 --> 00:12:41.124
Captain

116
00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:42.957
Here

117
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.990
Never mind

118
00:12:44.624 --> 00:12:45.723
Thank you for the rice ball

119
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.240
Spit it out

120
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.923
Spit it out

121
00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:52.923
I really do not understand whether
she is my sister or brother


122
00:12:53.124 --> 00:12:54.156
It's for captain

123
00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.700
But look at the way she lost
her parents at a young age


124
00:12:56.724 --> 00:12:59.189
and followed her brother to suffer.
How remarkable!


125
00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:00.356
It hurts

126
00:13:00.357 --> 00:13:01.689
Don't fight, talk it

127
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.923
By talking, you strange looking kid

128
00:13:03.924 --> 00:13:05.689
You think you don't look strange?

129
00:13:08.124 --> 00:13:09.456
Shut up

130
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.823
How can you kick there?

131
00:13:12.824 --> 00:13:13.824
Let go

132
00:14:05.224 --> 00:14:06.224
What happened?

133
00:14:06.257 --> 00:14:08.256
What's all this?

134
00:14:16.257 --> 00:14:16.889
Captain

135
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.523
Captain, where are you going?

136
00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:19.889
Captain

137
00:14:27.057 --> 00:14:28.989
Wake up, wake up

138
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.290
Wake up

139
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.389
You okay?

140
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.889
Yeah, I'm okay

141
00:14:45.124 --> 00:14:46.433
How many people are on the other side?

142
00:14:46.457 --> 00:14:47.956
I'm not sure

143
00:14:48.057 --> 00:14:49.423
Seems like a lot

144
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.689
Back up, back up

145
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.123
Back up, back up

146
00:15:47.724 --> 00:15:50.489
Waiting for the command. Come on

147
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.223
Wake up, wake up

148
00:17:10.424 --> 00:17:12.589
Back up

149
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.656
Back up

150
00:17:15.857 --> 00:17:18.289
Jin-joo

151
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.589
Tokyo, Japan

152
00:17:55.931 --> 00:17:58.904
1st Chosun Governor Ito Hirobumi

153
00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:17.201
You said your name is Yukie?

154
00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:18.724
Yes

155
00:19:19.462 --> 00:19:21.650
I am honored to be of service

156
00:19:22.353 --> 00:19:23.400
to Your Excellency

157
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:27.577
God does not give man two
blessings at the same time


158
00:19:28.725 --> 00:19:30.975
And yet you have both beauty
and wonderful dance moves


159
00:19:31.944 --> 00:19:33.936
I'm flattered

160
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.592
Do you have other talents besides dancing?

161
00:19:38.116 --> 00:19:40.194
Aren't you curious, sir?

162
00:19:41.624 --> 00:19:43.487
You...

163
00:19:45.573 --> 00:19:50.403
But why did Your Excellency
oppose the invasion of Korea?


164
00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:55.256
Everyone in the Choshu
clan is in favor of...


165
00:19:55.497 --> 00:19:57.189
Hey, Daisuke!

166
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.923
Yes!

167
00:19:58.078 --> 00:20:00.703
Do you know what to do to
make dogs listen to people?


168
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.360
What?

169
00:20:03.008 --> 00:20:06.420
The first method is to fight
until the end of life to scare it


170
00:20:07.326 --> 00:20:08.326
The second method is

171
00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:10.689
Pretending to like it and coaxing it

172
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.889
Make it actively wag its tail at people

173
00:20:13.405 --> 00:20:16.704
Now is the time to pretend
to like Korea to coax them


174
00:20:17.787 --> 00:20:18.787
Then

175
00:20:19.153 --> 00:20:22.070
Wait until they forget how
much they have to climb up


176
00:20:22.609 --> 00:20:24.859
and punish them

177
00:20:25.734 --> 00:20:26.734
So...

178
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:29.081
What was the reason for
removing Empress Myeongseong?


179
00:20:29.182 --> 00:20:32.057
When the dog wants to bite its master...

180
00:20:33.588 --> 00:20:34.596
kill it!

181
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:36.678
Good for you...

182
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:06.123
Seol-hee still remembers

183
00:21:07.978 --> 00:21:13.823
I remember

184
00:21:14.757 --> 00:21:22.489
you are so gentle and elegant

185
00:21:22.582 --> 00:21:29.456
I can't forget

186
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.956
in your eyes

187
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:36.713
in your eyes

188
00:21:40.357 --> 00:21:44.223
full of blood and tears

189
00:21:45.424 --> 00:21:52.556
makes me feel deep regret in heart

190
00:21:52.857 --> 00:22:00.356
I can't forget

191
00:22:00.357 --> 00:22:04.123
the scream that day

192
00:22:04.124 --> 00:22:07.656
still rings in my ears

193
00:22:07.657 --> 00:22:10.189
When Your Majesty leaves

194
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.923
your last sincere
I'm Chosun's Empress


195
00:22:15.024 --> 00:22:18.523
You gestured for me not to come closer

196
00:22:18.524 --> 00:22:22.489
You gave me the look
telling me to run away

197
00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:28.789
Under the moonlight in Building Okho

198
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.956
Your Majesty

199
00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:37.189
ronins held swords in the
yard Of Gyeongbokgung Palace


200
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:44.489
use a knife to Cut Out her majestys
heart, blood flows endlessly


201
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.289
her body was burnt to ashes
Your Majesty!


202
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:52.056
Her Majesty leaves forever

203
00:22:52.157 --> 00:23:00.157
Seol-hee can't forget that day

204
00:23:02.357 --> 00:23:06.356
in my dream I can't forget

205
00:23:06.357 --> 00:23:09.856
Your last look

206
00:23:09.857 --> 00:23:13.889
still see it clearly when close my eyes

207
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.356
the way you looked that
day is still in my mind


208
00:23:17.357 --> 00:23:20.756
can't forget even if I want to

209
00:23:20.757 --> 00:23:24.856
can't sleep even if I want to

210
00:23:24.857 --> 00:23:30.689
singing and sighing in one breath
drifting away with the wind


211
00:23:32.357 --> 00:23:40.357
singing and sighing in one breath
drifting away with the wind


212
00:23:50.424 --> 00:23:55.589
Your Majesty

213
00:23:58.994 --> 00:23:59.994
Seol-hee

214
00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:04.318
Mr. Kim

215
00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:08.484
Don't torture yourself anymore

216
00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:13.883
Please send me to Japan

217
00:24:14.957 --> 00:24:17.423
Didn't we talked about that?

218
00:24:17.424 --> 00:24:19.489
Someone has to step up

219
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.123
That's Her Majesty's...

220
00:24:21.124 --> 00:24:23.789
That's it, go back now

221
00:24:24.324 --> 00:24:25.324
Mr. Kim

222
00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:30.989
What the hell are you doing?

223
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.210
Please

224
00:24:34.271 --> 00:24:35.902
send me to Japan

225
00:24:55.424 --> 00:24:59.556
1909 Russia Vladivostok

226
00:25:01.724 --> 00:25:03.089
Daedong Press(Korean Press)

227
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.056
Daedong Press(Korean Press)

228
00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:44.150
Go and find our comrades,
invite them to eat Baozi


229
00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:45.856
So sudden

230
00:25:45.857 --> 00:25:47.323
There aren't any Baozi now

231
00:25:47.515 --> 00:25:48.624
I'll make some now

232
00:25:51.265 --> 00:25:52.380
I'll make some now

233
00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:56.789
Aigoo, what a temper

234
00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:02.116
Check out cigarette!

235
00:26:02.538 --> 00:26:04.905
Good quality tobacco!

236
00:26:06.304 --> 00:26:07.856
Cigarette!

237
00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:09.889
Let me try this

238
00:26:11.057 --> 00:26:14.323
- Give me that, you crazy
- Let go


239
00:26:16.257 --> 00:26:19.189
Treat your customers this
way, you'll have no business


240
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.746
Go now, your drool!

241
00:26:23.238 --> 00:26:24.981
My brother invites you to eat Baozi

242
00:26:26.869 --> 00:26:27.869
What?

243
00:26:37.783 --> 00:26:38.790
Crazy girl.

244
00:26:43.824 --> 00:26:44.824
Well

245
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.056
What... Jin-joo
Jin-joo


246
00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:55.723
My brother invites you to eat Baozi

247
00:26:56.224 --> 00:26:59.123
- Baozi?
- Um


248
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:04.022
I'm gonna kill you really...

249
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.725
I'll do this sort Of thing.
You can go inside and rest


250
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.522
It's okay, I'm not tired

251
00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:34.708
Rest inside

252
00:27:37.263 --> 00:27:39.216
I love you, honey

253
00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:43.895
I love you too

254
00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:00.623
Comrades, do you need something?

255
00:28:01.872 --> 00:28:04.013
My brother invites you to eat Baozi

256
00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:09.645
You need something?

257
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.142
- Go get some tea
- Um


258
00:28:18.222 --> 00:28:19.480
Here comes an intel

259
00:28:20.761 --> 00:28:22.136
Finally an intel

260
00:28:22.777 --> 00:28:24.941
It's about Hirobumi Ito

261
00:28:25.636 --> 00:28:28.152
We're finally close to the guy's head

262
00:28:28.659 --> 00:28:30.056
So what will happen next?

263
00:28:30.214 --> 00:28:31.222
What will happen?

264
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.973
I will shot that
guy right between his eyes

265
00:28:36.793 --> 00:28:39.332
Don't say scary things
in front of the kids

266
00:28:40.192 --> 00:28:41.606
Who are you calling a kid!

267
00:28:42.864 --> 00:28:45.465
An 18-year-old is sure a kid

268
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.323
still pees his bed

269
00:28:49.324 --> 00:28:51.926
Country's independence
has nothing to do with age


270
00:28:53.197 --> 00:28:57.823
Nothing?
Nothing?


271
00:28:58.111 --> 00:29:01.323
You are being impolite by
not speaking honorific to us


272
00:29:01.348 --> 00:29:02.728
You are the one being impolite

273
00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:03.723
What?

274
00:29:04.043 --> 00:29:05.557
Being old means you are authority?

275
00:29:05.582 --> 00:29:07.856
When did you ever teach us that?

276
00:29:07.857 --> 00:29:10.254
Right?

277
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.323
And you look strange

278
00:29:14.324 --> 00:29:17.089
I...
Get over here, you


279
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.389
You...

280
00:29:19.769 --> 00:29:21.378
You have suffered these days

281
00:29:22.191 --> 00:29:23.988
Don't blame yourself too much

282
00:29:24.013 --> 00:29:26.105
We all make mistakes sometimes

283
00:29:26.972 --> 00:29:31.230
We have issues with the money here anyway

284
00:29:31.878 --> 00:29:35.363
So, temperately open a shop
and recover from your injuries.


285
00:29:43.347 --> 00:29:44.907
Do you know what
I swore to my comrades

286
00:29:45.824 --> 00:29:47.995
when I cut off this finger?

287
00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:50.591
If, in 3 years,

288
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.849
we cannot execute our
national enemy, Ito Hirobumi


289
00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.154
we'll kill ourselves

290
00:29:58.818 --> 00:30:00.966
I came here to fulfil my vows

291
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800
Are you sure?

292
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:09.530
I'm sure.

293
00:30:09.608 --> 00:30:11.848
The Asian man without the
fourth finger on his left hand


294
00:30:12.108 --> 00:30:13.741
was clearly called Ahn Jung-geun

295
00:30:16.991 --> 00:30:17.991
Thank you

296
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:33.836
I'm starving! When can I eat the Baozi?

297
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.922
Pork with mashed garlic

298
00:30:44.947 --> 00:30:47.023
Mash the tofu

299
00:30:47.048 --> 00:30:51.680
Staffed with meat, steaming
hot, with good will


300
00:30:51.852 --> 00:30:56.523
Ma Doo-shik's Baozi is the best

301
00:30:56.594 --> 00:31:01.056
How I wish it could be ready soon

302
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:04.189
Still holding my breath and waiting

303
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.547
Gudoo, baozi, wangwang, baozi

304
00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:12.120
Mouth-watering. 
Imagine the taste

305
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:17.323
That's right, my craft

306
00:31:17.324 --> 00:31:22.423
You have to wait for it,
if you want to taste it


307
00:31:23.472 --> 00:31:28.171
Not just anyone can make famous Baozi

308
00:31:29.077 --> 00:31:33.556
But Baozi has a path of
fate that it must go through


309
00:31:33.557 --> 00:31:38.423
Even god can do nothing about it

310
00:31:38.424 --> 00:31:43.956
The rules of our house make best taste

311
00:31:43.981 --> 00:31:47.589
We are also famous for eating
famous Baozi with absolute taste


312
00:31:48.308 --> 00:31:50.269
I want to eat
the Baozi in one bite

313
00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:54.122
Gudoo, and swallow it all

314
00:31:54.147 --> 00:31:59.140
Oh hungry youth

315
00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:04.289
Eating and eating and still feeling hungry

316
00:32:04.314 --> 00:32:12.314
Missing mother and longing
for warm relationship


317
00:32:21.179 --> 00:32:22.585
So hot so hot!

318
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.665
Slow down! There's more

319
00:32:33.595 --> 00:32:34.954
You are heartless

320
00:32:34.979 --> 00:32:36.142
Are you beggars?

321
00:32:41.829 --> 00:32:43.118
Wait for me

322
00:32:43.143 --> 00:32:44.540
Where are you going?

323
00:32:44.565 --> 00:32:45.712
What is it?

324
00:32:58.556 --> 00:33:00.126
Nothing wrong?

325
00:33:00.595 --> 00:33:01.658
Come in!

326
00:33:13.585 --> 00:33:16.189
- Jung-geun
- Doo-shik


327
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.226
Jung-geun

328
00:33:23.179 --> 00:33:25.476
I thought I'd never see you again

329
00:33:29.913 --> 00:33:30.913
Deok-sun

330
00:33:34.664 --> 00:33:36.031
What's going on?

331
00:33:39.211 --> 00:33:41.969
You lost weight

332
00:33:45.601 --> 00:33:47.823
Good to see you, 
I'm Jo Do-seon

333
00:33:48.914 --> 00:33:51.062
Hello, I'm Ahn Jung-geun

334
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:52.648
I've heard a lot about you

335
00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:58.344
This is the best shooter here

336
00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.523
Running a laundry while helping us

337
00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:07.065
Sir, I've heard a lot about you
I'm Ryu Dong-ha


338
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.513
- This is from our liaison office
- Here are some Baozi


339
00:34:12.545 --> 00:34:13.545
Captain

340
00:34:14.092 --> 00:34:15.155
Jin-joo

341
00:34:16.045 --> 00:34:18.538
Captain! Captain!

342
00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:38.365
Ok, ok

343
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.509
Jung-geun, you must be starving

344
00:34:41.542 --> 00:34:43.933
Come here Let's sit

345
00:34:43.958 --> 00:34:45.756
Take a seat here

346
00:34:49.911 --> 00:34:52.061
How exciting this is!

347
00:34:55.858 --> 00:35:00.686
Weary youth

348
00:35:00.711 --> 00:35:05.456
Eating and eating and still feeling hungry

349
00:35:05.457 --> 00:35:13.457
Missing mother and longing
for warm relationship


350
00:35:15.133 --> 00:35:19.983
Empty inside, feeling hungry

351
00:35:20.008 --> 00:35:24.589
Making Baozi smoothing the weary youth

352
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.323
Making Baozi smoothing the weary youth

353
00:35:29.257 --> 00:35:31.510
Ito Hirobumi is seemingly

354
00:35:31.931 --> 00:35:35.190
pleasing the Koreans

355
00:35:35.215 --> 00:35:39.336
Although the pro-Korean
policy is being implemented


356
00:35:39.593 --> 00:35:40.609
But actually!

357
00:35:41.108 --> 00:35:44.264
It strips South Korea
of its diplomatic rights


358
00:35:45.328 --> 00:35:46.328
Slaughtering

359
00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:47.922
innocent people

360
00:35:48.433 --> 00:35:49.714
Ahn Jung-geun

361
00:35:52.481 --> 00:35:53.651
Run, hurry

362
00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:57.520
Hurry, hurry

363
00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:03.293
- That way
- Yes


364
00:36:33.748 --> 00:36:37.534
- Stop it now
- Goodbye


365
00:36:51.924 --> 00:36:54.156
Run faster, you guys

366
00:37:01.897 --> 00:37:02.623
What happened?

367
00:37:02.624 --> 00:37:04.303
No, no

368
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:05.889
North Korean.

369
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.423
Ahn Jung-geun!

370
00:37:50.057 --> 00:37:53.389
Wait a minute

371
00:37:56.634 --> 00:37:57.915
Damn it

372
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:00.680
Wait a minute

373
00:38:14.673 --> 00:38:15.673
Deok-joon

374
00:38:28.493 --> 00:38:29.493
Wait a minute

375
00:39:22.823 --> 00:39:26.323
- Captain!
- Comrade Ahn!


376
00:39:26.324 --> 00:39:31.323
Comrade Ahn! Jump off, jump off

377
00:39:32.857 --> 00:39:34.923
Hurry up!

378
00:39:34.924 --> 00:39:35.924
Hurry up!

379
00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:45.316
Ahn Jung-geun

380
00:39:57.381 --> 00:39:58.636
Sincerity

381
00:39:59.791 --> 00:40:01.948
What does it mean?

382
00:40:02.574 --> 00:40:06.050
With a will, you can achieve anything

383
00:40:06.773 --> 00:40:10.796
This is the motto of my
teacher, Matsuyin Yoshida


384
00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:15.382
It is also the belief that
has sustained me so far


385
00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:20.671
Your Honor, we're ready

386
00:40:21.416 --> 00:40:23.421
I heard you are
going to Harbin this time

387
00:40:23.826 --> 00:40:25.663
Yeah, with Russian
Finance Minister Kokovtsev


388
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.671
We'll talk recklessly

389
00:40:28.007 --> 00:40:30.952
It's not just a meeting
with the Finance Minister


390
00:40:32.867 --> 00:40:34.359
Now the time has come

391
00:40:36.271 --> 00:40:37.271
What?

392
00:40:40.952 --> 00:40:43.331
If things work out,

393
00:40:43.988 --> 00:40:46.574
let's drink a bottle of reserve
Brandy in the first month of next year


394
00:40:46.598 --> 00:40:47.598
Ok

395
00:40:54.565 --> 00:40:59.012
Dreams become ambitions,

396
00:40:59.285 --> 00:41:03.371
ambition is a way to be the future!

397
00:41:03.566 --> 00:41:07.699
All the things that come to mind,

398
00:41:07.924 --> 00:41:11.960
when that put into practice

399
00:41:12.413 --> 00:41:16.538
Like European powers and the United States,

400
00:41:16.732 --> 00:41:20.835
time to show the great soul of Japan!

401
00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:24.859
Followng the Emperor's great will

402
00:41:24.891 --> 00:41:29.696
showing our power

403
00:41:30.664 --> 00:41:31.993
Until now

404
00:41:32.564 --> 00:41:35.915
I am looking forward to show our power

405
00:41:36.915 --> 00:41:39.360
Finally, the moment has arrived

406
00:41:40.595 --> 00:41:42.720
Ahead Of Russia,

407
00:41:42.745 --> 00:41:45.134
using North Korea as a springboard,

408
00:41:45.166 --> 00:41:51.610
China is in our hands!

409
00:41:52.516 --> 00:41:53.953
Cheers!

410
00:41:54.389 --> 00:41:55.625
Cheers!

411
00:42:22.477 --> 00:42:29.523
I had a dream,

412
00:42:29.836 --> 00:42:34.407
small but precious dream

413
00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:42.719
But it disappeared

414
00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:50.469
Wiped out in a flash

415
00:42:52.321 --> 00:42:58.438
How can I forget?

416
00:42:59.781 --> 00:43:04.448
How do I erase?

417
00:43:07.445 --> 00:43:11.675
Sad memories of that day

418
00:43:14.878 --> 00:43:19.561
The painful story of that day

419
00:43:23.288 --> 00:43:29.589
I have to live even if I die

420
00:43:30.694 --> 00:43:37.389
I have to live
even if I am sad

421
00:43:37.962 --> 00:43:45.962
For it is my destiny given by god

422
00:43:53.221 --> 00:43:59.396
Someday I will be like that white ash,

423
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:07.421
disappearing into the air

424
00:44:13.607 --> 00:44:18.584
When the darkness has passed,

425
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:27.959
will rise the glorious sun

426
00:44:28.592 --> 00:44:33.849
When the winter has passed,

427
00:44:35.529 --> 00:44:42.506
will bloom brilliantly

428
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:50.332
I dreamed again

429
00:44:50.357 --> 00:44:58.277
I dreamed for you

430
00:45:30.097 --> 00:45:31.097
Hot! Hot!

431
00:45:36.929 --> 00:45:40.179
If you don't have the strength,
then ask someone to help you


432
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.317
Will Ito come to Harbin? When?

433
00:46:04.809 --> 00:46:06.239
I don't know the date yet

434
00:46:06.942 --> 00:46:09.062
He is going to meet with
the Russian Finance Minister


435
00:46:10.372 --> 00:46:13.989
Looks like he's going to meet
with the Russian Finance Minister?


436
00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:19.614
I'm sorry, so sorry

437
00:46:19.639 --> 00:46:24.423
Bastard, Keep your voice down
You are late


438
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:26.590
Where did you go?

439
00:46:26.988 --> 00:46:27.988
In that case,

440
00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:29.840
let's go get Ito

441
00:46:30.848 --> 00:46:31.848
What?

442
00:46:32.699 --> 00:46:33.699
What do you mean?

443
00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:37.226
To get this close to Ito,

444
00:46:37.407 --> 00:46:39.228
it won't happen again

445
00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:43.079
Even so, it's not easy

446
00:46:43.104 --> 00:46:46.384
Nothing is easy for us now

447
00:46:51.973 --> 00:46:53.751
We have to catch Ito,

448
00:46:54.539 --> 00:46:57.986
Because he is the culprit
of Japanese imperialism


449
00:46:58.975 --> 00:47:00.707
If Ito is not executed,

450
00:47:01.223 --> 00:47:03.989
We will not be able to achieve
independence and peace for the Korean


451
00:47:05.647 --> 00:47:09.646
Comrade Ahn Chonghan's
words are irrefutable


452
00:47:09.671 --> 00:47:10.872
That's why he came back

453
00:47:12.855 --> 00:47:15.376
But it's time to stop

454
00:47:19.994 --> 00:47:21.775
I want to follow you, sir

455
00:47:22.677 --> 00:47:25.310
Please catch the enemy of our nation, Ito!

456
00:47:28.967 --> 00:47:31.908
I also followed Comrade
Ahn's mission this time


457
00:47:32.519 --> 00:47:35.185
Let me shoot Ito

458
00:47:35.415 --> 00:47:36.415
Don't worry

459
00:47:38.019 --> 00:47:39.713
- Sit down
- Okay


460
00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:42.854
I'm going to find out
what weapons are needed


461
00:47:43.187 --> 00:47:44.392
Ok

462
00:47:45.134 --> 00:47:49.253
Hmm, really

463
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:57.523
I'm standing up

464
00:48:19.648 --> 00:48:20.648
Hey!

465
00:48:21.324 --> 00:48:23.073
What are you doing instead of cleaning?

466
00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:27.085
Always wandering off

467
00:48:32.444 --> 00:48:33.444
Sorry

468
00:48:34.327 --> 00:48:35.499
We're closed

469
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:37.398
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

470
00:48:40.264 --> 00:48:41.304
Who are you talking about?

471
00:48:44.928 --> 00:48:47.108
I'm asking you where Ahn Jung-geun is?

472
00:48:50.931 --> 00:48:53.428
What are these people saying now?

473
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:58.144
- Brother
- What are you doing?


474
00:48:58.177 --> 00:49:01.160
Where are you guys going?

475
00:49:01.208 --> 00:49:02.208
No

476
00:49:03.424 --> 00:49:06.558
Jin-joo Jin-joo

477
00:49:14.535 --> 00:49:17.691
When Ahn Jung-geun comes, tell him clearly!

478
00:49:17.767 --> 00:49:21.433
If he wants to save his
friends, come to me...


479
00:49:25.222 --> 00:49:26.910
Where is Ahn Jung-geun?

480
00:49:26.935 --> 00:49:28.001
Say it, Bastard

481
00:49:29.527 --> 00:49:31.316
I don't know...

482
00:49:32.205 --> 00:49:34.855
Say it, Bastard

483
00:49:36.808 --> 00:49:38.605
Boy...

484
00:49:42.807 --> 00:49:44.221
Look at my scars

485
00:49:45.331 --> 00:49:46.364
It's serious, isn't it?

486
00:49:47.564 --> 00:49:49.204
This is the scar Ahn Jung-geun gave me...

487
00:49:51.823 --> 00:49:53.189
Is that funny?

488
00:49:54.215 --> 00:49:55.248
Is that funny?

489
00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:58.667
Damn

490
00:50:03.363 --> 00:50:04.562
Psycho...

491
00:50:05.118 --> 00:50:07.558
we have found the person who
sold the weapon to Ahn Jung-geun


492
00:50:08.788 --> 00:50:09.788
Really?

493
00:50:10.483 --> 00:50:11.483
Catch up!

494
00:50:11.578 --> 00:50:12.578
Yes!

495
00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:31.190
Come to the barren land of Russia,

496
00:50:31.501 --> 00:50:34.651
persevere through the tough years

497
00:50:36.026 --> 00:50:40.112
Me, Ma Doo-shik is unshakeable

498
00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:44.952
I won't betray

499
00:50:46.741 --> 00:50:50.556
In the sorrow of wandering
in another country,


500
00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:54.374
comfort each other

501
00:50:55.531 --> 00:50:59.398
Whatever he is, whoever he is,

502
00:50:59.663 --> 00:51:04.856
He's just my friend

503
00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:10.429
Even in the weathered years,

504
00:51:10.454 --> 00:51:13.937
Like the unshakable Tarzan,

505
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:19.210
Me, Ma Doo-shik is unshakeable too

506
00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:24.046
I won't betray,

507
00:51:26.327 --> 00:51:27.773
I won't betray!

508
00:51:28.624 --> 00:51:36.460
I won't betray!

509
00:51:41.206 --> 00:51:42.601
Jung-geun

510
00:51:52.361 --> 00:51:53.960
Brother

511
00:51:56.378 --> 00:51:58.679
Get up, brother

512
00:53:04.126 --> 00:53:05.545
What is our country?

513
00:53:15.897 --> 00:53:18.030
What does our country mean to us?

514
00:53:28.335 --> 00:53:31.108
Sun in other countries,

515
00:53:32.351 --> 00:53:34.967
the Wide Earth

516
00:53:36.457 --> 00:53:41.366
Where we are?

517
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.827
Should I forget?

518
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:49.412
Can I forget?

519
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:56.444
The hometown that I missed in my dreams

520
00:53:58.045 --> 00:54:02.964
I was born in this world

521
00:54:04.614 --> 00:54:09.989
with a big heart

522
00:54:10.286 --> 00:54:15.286
Even if I die, I will
never forget that heart


523
00:54:15.646 --> 00:54:21.232
Swear to god,

524
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.895
a scary future

525
00:54:25.049 --> 00:54:27.815
I gathered my courage,

526
00:54:28.516 --> 00:54:33.515
we keep going

527
00:54:34.347 --> 00:54:37.113
Swallowing tears,

528
00:54:37.327 --> 00:54:39.872
erase the sigh

529
00:54:40.724 --> 00:54:45.756
Get back on track

530
00:54:46.955 --> 00:54:51.733
Mother, Mother

531
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:57.912
The way you cry in melancholy

532
00:54:59.358 --> 00:55:04.265
Will meet at dawn?

533
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:10.856
My distant hometown

534
00:55:10.881 --> 00:55:16.989
Miracle is our heart,

535
00:55:17.014 --> 00:55:22.123
heart pounding

536
00:55:22.168 --> 00:55:29.023
Thoughts of the motherland,

537
00:55:29.024 --> 00:55:34.356
brings me to tears

538
00:55:34.657 --> 00:55:41.056
I was born in this world,

539
00:55:41.057 --> 00:55:46.423
with a big heart

540
00:55:46.424 --> 00:55:51.286
Even if I die, 
I never forget that heart

541
00:55:51.311 --> 00:55:57.989
Swear to god,

542
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:03.989
God, please help me!

543
00:56:04.028 --> 00:56:09.056
Let us make our dreams come true

544
00:56:09.114 --> 00:56:16.156
God, please bless me

545
00:56:16.184 --> 00:56:24.184
To make us finally achieve our ambition

546
00:57:06.442 --> 00:57:10.262
The burning sun

547
00:57:10.372 --> 00:57:13.668
is the heart of Japan!

548
00:57:14.409 --> 00:57:18.137
The pure heart and red blood,

549
00:57:18.481 --> 00:57:21.754
it's the flag of Japan!

550
00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:26.114
The rising sun and the dazzling glory,

551
00:57:26.504 --> 00:57:29.809
it is the great will of the Emperor!

552
00:57:30.473 --> 00:57:33.981
We are the subjects of the Empire,

553
00:57:34.255 --> 00:57:37.520
support the Emperor!

554
00:57:40.801 --> 00:57:42.989
This visit to Harbin

555
00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.458
for me it's the last
mission for the country


556
00:57:46.606 --> 00:57:49.189
To start the Far East Civilization,

557
00:57:49.536 --> 00:57:51.036
this is the best path!

558
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:55.152
For the prosperity of the
Great Japanese Empire!


559
00:57:55.293 --> 00:57:56.575
Hooray!

560
00:57:57.425 --> 00:58:02.074
My battlefield is full of waves

561
00:58:02.425 --> 00:58:07.161
Tomorrow we will go to Bohai Sea

562
00:58:07.473 --> 00:58:12.012
The ice-free port Dalian

563
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:17.684
This place belongs to Japan!

564
00:58:18.113 --> 00:58:22.270
Manchuria is our land

565
00:58:22.809 --> 00:58:27.559
This is my dream

566
00:58:27.997 --> 00:58:32.512
From then on

567
00:58:33.066 --> 00:58:36.731
To realize your dreams,

568
00:58:38.387 --> 00:58:42.637
what we only have is,

569
00:58:43.387 --> 00:58:47.567
The idea of moving forward!

570
00:58:48.246 --> 00:58:51.253
Take the vast Manchuria

571
00:58:51.278 --> 00:58:57.917
in our hands!

572
00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:02.315
I have a dream!

573
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:08.332
A dream that I
look forward for a lifetime!

574
00:59:08.357 --> 00:59:10.651
Asia has fallen behind!

575
00:59:10.987 --> 00:59:12.940
Asia is in danger!

576
00:59:13.534 --> 00:59:15.815
A powerful Japan needs to be built

577
00:59:16.073 --> 00:59:19.276
Rule Asia!

578
00:59:19.916 --> 00:59:22.573
This is my dream!

579
00:59:22.948 --> 00:59:27.034
Great East Asia Co
-Prosperity

580
00:59:28.774 --> 00:59:32.870
This is my dream!

581
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:39.433
Great East Asia Co
-Prosperity!

582
00:59:45.011 --> 00:59:46.495
Awesome! Awesome!

583
00:59:46.794 --> 00:59:47.794
Hey, hey

584
00:59:48.259 --> 00:59:49.791
Can you also use the pistol like this?

585
00:59:53.866 --> 00:59:54.884
Next Dong-ha and Deok-joon

586
00:59:57.948 --> 00:59:59.136
Damn it.

587
01:00:01.174 --> 01:00:02.800
Okay. Don't be nervous

588
01:00:03.785 --> 01:00:05.769
One, Two

589
01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:08.267
Hey

590
01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:10.132
- What happened?
- Shoot after I count to three


591
01:00:10.394 --> 01:00:11.847
Missed

592
01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:14.332
But teacher, this one

593
01:00:14.357 --> 01:00:16.199
this safety catch

594
01:00:16.224 --> 01:00:17.976
- You sod
- Shouldn't it be tightened?


595
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.749
How can you point at
someone with the muzzle?


596
01:00:25.378 --> 01:00:27.044
What are you doing?

597
01:00:28.195 --> 01:00:29.195
What?

598
01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:34.643
- I was careless for a moment
- Comrades


599
01:00:38.477 --> 01:00:39.578
Comrades

600
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:43.140
Estimated time of arrival
is October 26 at 9:00 a.m.


601
01:00:43.338 --> 01:00:45.898
The Harbin Station. The special
carriage of the fifth train.


602
01:00:46.322 --> 01:00:47.342
The white handkerchief.

603
01:00:47.367 --> 01:00:51.420
It is the news that Ito will
come to Harbin via Caijiagou


604
01:00:51.662 --> 01:00:53.662
The start date is finally set

605
01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:58.446
What's wrong?

606
01:00:58.554 --> 01:00:59.740
Any problems?

607
01:01:00.129 --> 01:01:02.709
To find out what kind of
proposal Ito has with Russia


608
01:01:03.217 --> 01:01:04.351
According to this proposal,

609
01:01:04.519 --> 01:01:06.155
it is not only our country that
will be decided in the future


610
01:01:06.179 --> 01:01:08.968
But also the fate of Northeast
Asia, including China


611
01:01:09.459 --> 01:01:10.899
Please inform us of the intelligence

612
01:01:11.347 --> 01:01:14.416
In this meeting, Ito and Russia,
what kind of proposal was achieved?


613
01:01:14.441 --> 01:01:15.942
Make sure to check it out

614
01:01:23.216 --> 01:01:25.757
Harbin

615
01:01:27.622 --> 01:01:28.622
Teacher

616
01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:29.833
Yes?

617
01:01:30.194 --> 01:01:33.280
If we failed at the Harbin Station

618
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.593
There's only one chance

619
01:01:39.354 --> 01:01:41.194
How about branching our
army into two columns?


620
01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.650
Look

621
01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.581
There is a long distance
between Changchun and Harbin


622
01:01:50.605 --> 01:01:51.605
Right?

623
01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:53.682
Then until the train reaches its

624
01:01:53.849 --> 01:01:55.486
In the station,

625
01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:58.096
it will stop, won't it?

626
01:01:58.783 --> 01:02:01.869
Then, the most likely stopping point is

627
01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:06.513
Caijiagou

628
01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:09.810
That's good

629
01:02:10.135 --> 01:02:11.135
Here

630
01:02:11.316 --> 01:02:12.641
Right at the Caijiagou Station

631
01:02:13.268 --> 01:02:14.977
He is with me

632
01:02:15.787 --> 01:02:17.039
Then teacher and me

633
01:02:17.488 --> 01:02:18.587
Here at the Harbin Station

634
01:02:19.505 --> 01:02:20.844
Clever. So, clever

635
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.794
If we branch our army into two columns

636
01:02:23.819 --> 01:02:25.445
No matter where Ito is

637
01:02:28.435 --> 01:02:30.589
I thought you were a fool

638
01:02:31.995 --> 01:02:33.727
My head is not so big for nothing

639
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:35.003
Still don't get it?

640
01:02:35.813 --> 01:02:36.995
That's means...

641
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.394
I will go to Caijiagou with you

642
01:02:38.419 --> 01:02:40.300
- Dong-ha, you're in the Harbin
- Okay


643
01:02:40.362 --> 01:02:42.522
You're such a clever person

644
01:02:42.775 --> 01:02:44.108
Ito is screwed

645
01:02:45.358 --> 01:02:46.975
Big head, really!

646
01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:50.561
That's good

647
01:02:51.096 --> 01:02:53.835
The deep sign of...

648
01:02:57.378 --> 01:02:59.538
twenty million compatriots

649
01:02:59.773 --> 01:03:06.339
Like this wind that blows instead of them

650
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:12.913
My sleeping soul

651
01:03:16.343 --> 01:03:21.038
Passed by the exhausting me and said,

652
01:03:21.203 --> 01:03:26.812
it's time to leave

653
01:03:28.036 --> 01:03:34.330
That's your road

654
01:03:37.728 --> 01:03:43.775
A difficult test is
a must to go through

655
01:03:44.229 --> 01:03:48.728
in distant lands of other countries

656
01:03:49.854 --> 01:03:57.854
But, that's my destiny

657
01:04:03.604 --> 01:04:08.603
What we cannot forget is...

658
01:04:09.702 --> 01:04:12.088
the stolen homeland

659
01:04:12.113 --> 01:04:18.689
Our struggling parents and brothers,

660
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.244
the way we're in

661
01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:30.260
just a distant tomorrow
and a terrible future


662
01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:37.471
But we cannot give up

663
01:04:37.496 --> 01:04:45.496
for our future generations

664
01:04:47.161 --> 01:04:53.002
Although if time passes, it
will disappear in history


665
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:59.223
Names will not be left

666
01:04:59.248 --> 01:05:07.248
I want to live without
regret at this moment today


667
01:05:12.972 --> 01:05:19.315
For that day

668
01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:24.276
We put our arms around each
other's shoulders and say,


669
01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:27.908
Come on!

670
01:05:27.933 --> 01:05:30.842
Wind. Please help me

671
01:05:30.867 --> 01:05:33.928
Give us power

672
01:05:33.953 --> 01:05:40.233
For that promised day

673
01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:46.952
Come on. Let the world hear our cry

674
01:05:46.977 --> 01:05:53.149
The cry of the nation and the passion

675
01:05:53.174 --> 01:05:59.296
For the beloved homeland

676
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.813
Thank you

677
01:06:04.352 --> 01:06:05.352
Captain

678
01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:08.884
This...

679
01:06:09.249 --> 01:06:10.887
This is the hat
once worn by my brother

680
01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:13.294
No matter where he is

681
01:06:14.336 --> 01:06:15.989
He will protect you

682
01:06:17.262 --> 01:06:18.262
Thank you

683
01:06:18.938 --> 01:06:20.380
We must succeed

684
01:06:20.913 --> 01:06:23.614
Don't make your brother's
sacrifice become useless


685
01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:53.294
For that day

686
01:06:53.894 --> 01:06:58.834
We put our arms around each
other's shoulders and say


687
01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:02.568
Come on!

688
01:07:02.593 --> 01:07:05.959
Wind. Please help me.

689
01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:09.053
Give us power

690
01:07:09.078 --> 01:07:15.272
For that promised day

691
01:07:15.304 --> 01:07:21.459
Come on. Let the world hear our cry

692
01:07:21.484 --> 01:07:27.958
The cry of the nation and the passion

693
01:07:27.983 --> 01:07:35.983
For our beloved homeland

694
01:07:41.003 --> 01:07:48.669
Homeland

695
01:07:54.986 --> 01:07:57.826
October, 1909 China Harbin - Harbin
is already in a festive mood, right?


696
01:07:58.203 --> 01:08:01.723
October, 1909 China Harbin - But why did you
follow me? I told you that I would go myself


697
01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.776
How can I let you go to such
a dangerous place by yourself?


698
01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:07.746
Anyway, you should act
inconspicuously like a couple


699
01:08:22.562 --> 01:08:23.667
Couple won't act like this

700
01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:42.612
There is no questioning at the entrance

701
01:08:42.941 --> 01:08:43.941
Yes

702
01:08:45.675 --> 01:08:49.027
Anyway, it's better to
go inside and observe


703
01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:50.917
That's right

704
01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.380
Okay

705
01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:05.900
Take care of yourself

706
01:09:09.162 --> 01:09:10.785
Shouldn't we go together?

707
01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.119
The teacher didn't told us to go together

708
01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:17.986
Hungry, right?

709
01:09:19.278 --> 01:09:20.278
Wait me for a second

710
01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:21.657
No

711
01:09:40.452 --> 01:09:41.452
Get out of the way

712
01:09:49.023 --> 01:09:50.087
Captain

713
01:09:56.127 --> 01:09:58.244
You bastard

714
01:10:16.811 --> 01:10:17.811
9 AM in the morning

715
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.643
The fifth carriage of the special train

716
01:10:21.087 --> 01:10:22.119
The white handkerchief

717
01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:35.363
Tell me!

718
01:10:35.785 --> 01:10:37.284
Where is Ahn Jung-geun!

719
01:10:38.529 --> 01:10:40.628
You must know where he is!

720
01:10:49.494 --> 01:10:50.893
You crazy bitch...

721
01:10:53.451 --> 01:10:54.451
Go to hell!

722
01:10:54.729 --> 01:10:55.729
Go to hell!

723
01:10:55.902 --> 01:10:56.902
Go to hell!

724
01:10:57.449 --> 01:10:58.449
You crazy bitch...

725
01:10:58.572 --> 01:10:59.572
Go to hell!

726
01:10:59.705 --> 01:11:00.705
Jin-joo

727
01:11:20.588 --> 01:11:21.948
What the hell is wrong with you...

728
01:11:24.996 --> 01:11:26.157
Bastard

729
01:11:27.677 --> 01:11:28.677
No

730
01:11:29.003 --> 01:11:30.003
Out of my way!
Jinjoo


731
01:12:00.992 --> 01:12:01.992
Jin-joo

732
01:12:03.088 --> 01:12:04.088
Jin-joo

733
01:12:14.745 --> 01:12:18.675
Like the winter snow,

734
01:12:19.594 --> 01:12:23.847
Like the lamp lighting up the night,

735
01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:28.300
Like flower fragrance filling the air,

736
01:12:28.325 --> 01:12:34.347
you walked into my heart

737
01:12:35.244 --> 01:12:39.710
Trembling all over,

738
01:12:39.944 --> 01:12:44.519
Tears rolling down,

739
01:12:45.457 --> 01:12:49.347
I dare not speak up lest
you would disappear,


740
01:12:50.604 --> 01:12:54.535
Lest this is just a dream

741
01:12:55.964 --> 01:13:03.160
The hidden you is my first love

742
01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:10.542
My heart beats wildly,

743
01:13:10.997 --> 01:13:15.761
As if I couldn't breathe

744
01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:20.570
With my tears rolling down,

745
01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:25.739
You won't understand my heart

746
01:13:26.838 --> 01:13:30.838
I'm leaving at this moment

747
01:13:31.517 --> 01:13:36.073
You're weeping in sorrow

748
01:13:36.854 --> 01:13:44.432
Can I believe this is love?

749
01:13:48.356 --> 01:13:51.338
Don't weep, my dear

750
01:13:52.716 --> 01:13:57.001
Don't grieve, my dear

751
01:13:58.369 --> 01:14:02.433
Look at me and smile

752
01:14:03.581 --> 01:14:08.753
I'm happy

753
01:14:39.937 --> 01:14:45.019
My heart beats wildly,

754
01:14:45.494 --> 01:14:50.394
As if I couldn't breathe

755
01:14:50.593 --> 01:14:55.292
With my tears rolling down,

756
01:14:55.824 --> 01:15:00.651
You won't understand my heart

757
01:15:01.002 --> 01:15:05.587
Now you've gone

758
01:15:06.087 --> 01:15:11.244
That's why I'm weeping in sorrow

759
01:15:11.308 --> 01:15:19.308
Can I believe this is love?

760
01:15:21.743 --> 01:15:25.665
Please rest in peace now

761
01:15:27.088 --> 01:15:30.860
Don't be sad

762
01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:37.082
I'll remember you,

763
01:15:38.205 --> 01:15:43.214
Until the day we meet again

764
01:15:48.802 --> 01:15:50.168
Jin-joo

765
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:54.330
Jin-joo

766
01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:06.051
It said that you met his
Majesty before you leave...


767
01:16:06.254 --> 01:16:07.254
Yes

768
01:16:07.531 --> 01:16:09.441
What did you talk about?

769
01:16:09.809 --> 01:16:11.840
His Majesty plans to

770
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.560
issue the imperial edict of annexing Korea

771
01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.280
The imperial edict of annexing Korea?

772
01:16:15.644 --> 01:16:18.081
Japan will annex Korea

773
01:16:18.393 --> 01:16:20.277
and become the most powerful Asian country

774
01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:21.800
But,

775
01:16:21.825 --> 01:16:23.683
will Russia agree?

776
01:16:24.215 --> 01:16:26.414
We have Manchu

777
01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:30.667
Give it to Russia

778
01:16:31.093 --> 01:16:34.699
and they'll agree on our
colonial rule of Korea!


779
01:16:35.423 --> 01:16:38.159
Colonial rule?

780
01:16:38.184 --> 01:16:40.355
Korea is so lucky

781
01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:44.613
to become part of the Empire of Japan
that is as powerful as western powers!


782
01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:21.810
His Excellency is looking for you!

783
01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:23.824
Yes, in a minute!

784
01:17:46.972 --> 01:17:49.347
I'm sorry I had to get changed...

785
01:17:59.165 --> 01:18:02.331
The Harbin Talk. Give Manchu to Russia.
Japan gains real colonial rule.


786
01:18:30.391 --> 01:18:35.034
My mission is already over

787
01:18:36.794 --> 01:18:38.894
Even if I fail,

788
01:18:39.803 --> 01:18:43.441
I hope someone else will
finish the assassination


789
01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:02.608
How...

790
01:19:03.923 --> 01:19:05.112
How dare you!

791
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:07.229
Kill me

792
01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:09.034
You're Korean?

793
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760
Kill me

794
01:19:14.341 --> 01:19:15.507
Why?

795
01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.486
Why on earth!

796
01:19:20.116 --> 01:19:21.580
Haven't I been...

797
01:19:22.713 --> 01:19:23.830
nice enough to you?

798
01:19:23.855 --> 01:19:25.080
Even if I die,

799
01:19:25.946 --> 01:19:28.783
I won't forgive you for what you did

800
01:19:30.221 --> 01:19:31.330
to our Empress!

801
01:19:34.649 --> 01:19:35.649
Your Excellency!

802
01:19:37.869 --> 01:19:40.149
Interrogate this woman
after arriving at Harbin


803
01:19:40.899 --> 01:19:42.998
There must be someone behind her

804
01:19:43.985 --> 01:19:45.557
Find the person behind her

805
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.549
even if you have to tear her up!

806
01:19:48.609 --> 01:19:49.609
Understand!

807
01:19:49.719 --> 01:19:50.719
Yes!

808
01:19:53.783 --> 01:19:54.783
Kill me!

809
01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:56.041
Kill me!!

810
01:19:57.282 --> 01:19:58.848
Damn Korean!

811
01:20:14.603 --> 01:20:18.385
26th Now 1909
Early in the morning of assassination day


812
01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:21.610
The content of Harbin Talk. Give Manchu
to Russia. Japan gains real colonial rule.


813
01:20:53.902 --> 01:20:58.726
My Lord, I'm sitting here,

814
01:20:59.867 --> 01:21:04.734
kneeling and praying

815
01:21:06.101 --> 01:21:12.687
I believe in your will and follow you

816
01:21:18.185 --> 01:21:23.008
Facing the coming trial,
I'll believe in you


817
01:21:24.358 --> 01:21:28.937
Cast all my fear aside

818
01:21:30.367 --> 01:21:33.718
My trembling hands,

819
01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:40.289
My Lord, please do hold them.

820
01:21:41.279 --> 01:21:46.547
If I succeed

821
01:21:47.935 --> 01:21:53.375
My Lord, please allow me

822
01:21:54.458 --> 01:21:59.748
For that person, for peace

823
01:21:59.773 --> 01:22:06.789
Allow me the brief moment to pray

824
01:22:06.814 --> 01:22:13.078
I left behind my poor families

825
01:22:13.934 --> 01:22:19.406
The mother who hides me in her heart

826
01:22:19.918 --> 01:22:27.918
Please don't let her forget me

827
01:22:32.734 --> 01:22:40.734
I'm here carving the Cross and praying

828
01:22:42.845 --> 01:22:45.757
My Lord

829
01:22:45.782 --> 01:22:53.782
Please honor my request of the last moment

830
01:22:59.717 --> 01:23:07.539
Please give me the courage

831
01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:18.273
Courage and forgiveness
will both follow your will


832
01:23:18.298 --> 01:23:26.298
Courage and forgiveness
will both follow your will


833
01:23:36.523 --> 01:23:40.968
Caijiagou Station, China

834
01:23:46.409 --> 01:23:47.941
Anything wrong with you?

835
01:23:48.319 --> 01:23:49.964
Why are your hands trembling all the time?

836
01:23:49.988 --> 01:23:51.857
I'm not trembling. Shut up

837
01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:53.492
How much time to go?

838
01:23:54.204 --> 01:23:55.310
It will be here soon.

839
01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:01.130
Anything wrong with you?

840
01:24:01.312 --> 01:24:02.992
Why are your hands trembling all the time?

841
01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:06.193
I'm cold

842
01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.169
Brace yourself up! 5th carriage

843
01:24:25.191 --> 01:24:26.852
5th carriage

844
01:24:32.374 --> 01:24:33.860
Shouldn't it stop here?

845
01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.370
It should

846
01:24:38.038 --> 01:24:39.899
Don't move!

847
01:25:03.201 --> 01:25:04.967
Your Royal Highness,

848
01:25:06.797 --> 01:25:12.230
I'm sorry I didn't do anything big

849
01:25:13.944 --> 01:25:18.431
Please take me away with you, your Highness

850
01:25:24.262 --> 01:25:28.874
Though I struggled and struggled,

851
01:25:28.899 --> 01:25:32.965
trying so hard to avoid,

852
01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.839
it approached me more viciously

853
01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.473
The misery of the world,

854
01:25:43.874 --> 01:25:51.874
my heart's broken, tears rolling down

855
01:25:53.261 --> 01:26:00.571
The only thing I can do

856
01:26:04.103 --> 01:26:08.839
The misery of the world

857
01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:13.239
My broken heart

858
01:26:13.881 --> 01:26:21.829
At the edge of death, 
I can't return

859
01:26:23.126 --> 01:26:31.126
My sad fate is like a tilted heart

860
01:26:33.148 --> 01:26:41.148
A ruthless fate where I can't survive

861
01:26:42.954 --> 01:26:48.582
Why is my heart so vulnerable?

862
01:26:48.607 --> 01:26:52.606
It shouldn't be like this.

863
01:26:53.017 --> 01:27:01.017
Though I struggled,
trying so hard to avoid,


864
01:27:03.665 --> 01:27:08.606
Oh, my fate,

865
01:27:08.607 --> 01:27:13.039
Approached me more viciously,

866
01:27:13.715 --> 01:27:21.715
during this time when I'm cut
off from the outside world


867
01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:38.978
If gods really exist,

868
01:27:39.235 --> 01:27:47.235
I want to be reborn as
the daughter of Korea


869
01:27:48.165 --> 01:27:52.197
I beg you. I pray

870
01:27:53.204 --> 01:28:01.204
My sad fate is like a tilted heart

871
01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:10.158
The only thing I can do

872
01:28:13.804 --> 01:28:21.804
is to bid the pitiful world farewell

873
01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:03.632

Ito!

875
01:30:20.718 --> 01:30:22.821
Your unrealistic dream is over

876
01:30:24.617 --> 01:30:30.313
My dream to return home is over too

877
01:30:36.728 --> 01:30:38.664
Ito!

878
01:30:54.812 --> 01:31:00.977
Long live the Korean Empire!

01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:34.109
What is your job?

884
01:31:34.466 --> 01:31:36.386
The Chief of Staff, Korean
Empire Volunteer Army


885
01:31:40.242 --> 01:31:42.328
What's the reason for
killing Mr. Hirobumi Ito?


886
01:31:43.025 --> 01:31:45.185
For the autonomy and
independence Of the Korean Empire


887
01:31:45.574 --> 01:31:46.890
and the peace in East Asia

888

Peace in East Asia?

Do you know what is
the peace in East Asia?

It refers to the autonomous independence
and peace of all countries in East Asia


891
01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:04.425
We have the same purpose,

892
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:06.650
which is to earn
the peace in East Asia!

893
01:32:07.077 --> 01:32:08.899
Do you know, for the
development of the North Korea,


894
01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.523
how hard the Japan is?

895
01:32:11.518 --> 01:32:14.562
Shouldn't North Korea be grateful to Japan?

896
01:32:15.308 --> 01:32:16.734
For what?

897
01:32:20.727 --> 01:32:23.804
Are you doing what you're
doing for North Korea,


898
01:32:24.094 --> 01:32:25.489
or for Japan?

899
01:32:27.771 --> 01:32:31.138
Are you doing what you're
doing for North Korea,


900
01:32:31.919 --> 01:32:33.294
or for Japan?

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:39.825
When you need the deed

When you need the title

01:32:44.231 --> 01:32:47.385
Elder brother, Ahn Jong-geun;
Second brother, Ahn Gong-geun


905
01:32:47.386 --> 01:32:47.423
If you need my life, 
I'll also give you

906
01:32:47.982 --> 01:32:52.751

907
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:57.860

908
01:32:58.641 --> 01:32:59.853
Must help me

February 14th, 1910
Lushun Kanto Superior Court


910
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:11.102
Be quiet!

911
01:33:12.659 --> 01:33:13.692
Be quiet!

912
01:33:17.556 --> 01:33:23.337
The attorneys argued that the defendant in the
case, Ahn Jung-geun, was poor in knowledge,


913
01:33:23.362 --> 01:33:27.907
and had misunderstood
Ito Hirobumi's policies!


914
01:33:28.484 --> 01:33:29.970
Is it true?

915
01:33:31.197 --> 01:33:32.197
No

916
01:33:32.675 --> 01:33:35.268
I know the policy of Hirobumi
Ito better than anyone


917
01:33:35.614 --> 01:33:39.206
For Ito Hirobumi, who disturbed the peace in East
Asia and obstructed the independence of Korea,


918
01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:40.129
not in my personal,

919
01:33:40.154 --> 01:33:41.573
but as a lieutenant of the
Korean Volunteer Corps,


920
01:33:41.597 --> 01:33:43.682
I sniped at him

921
01:33:44.242 --> 01:33:47.773
So I am not obligated to be
tried in a Japanese court.


922
01:33:48.725 --> 01:33:52.695
I am, serving as the Chief of Staff of the Korean
Empire Volunteer Army conducting independent campaigns


923
01:33:52.719 --> 01:33:55.468
and I killed the enemy leader Hirobumi Ito

924
01:33:56.379 --> 01:33:59.881
So, I'm not a criminal
but a prisoner of war


925
01:34:02.953 --> 01:34:04.921
What are you doing?

926
01:34:05.916 --> 01:34:06.945
The judge is Japanese

927
01:34:07.749 --> 01:34:08.804
The procurator is Japanese

928
01:34:08.829 --> 01:34:09.788
The lawyer is Japanese

929
01:34:09.813 --> 01:34:10.858
The gallery are Japanese

930
01:34:12.287 --> 01:34:14.709
Why is there still a verdict?

931
01:34:17.982 --> 01:34:21.256
I took the Korean lawyer there

932
01:34:21.289 --> 01:34:26.365
Please, just let him in

933
01:34:26.513 --> 01:34:27.776
Defendant, Ahn Jung-geun!

934
01:34:28.286 --> 01:34:30.485
Your last chance for rebuttal!

935
01:34:31.153 --> 01:34:34.052
For the Lord,

936
01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:36.475
I repent for the murder of Hirobumi Ito,

937
01:34:39.345 --> 01:34:40.465
but I don't for my personal,

938
01:34:40.852 --> 01:34:43.595
while as the Chief of Staff of
the Korean Empire Voluntee Army,


939
01:34:44.116 --> 01:34:46.939
I want to justify the reason
for killing Hirobumi Ito


940
01:34:47.626 --> 01:34:49.373
The reason is

941
01:34:49.713 --> 01:34:53.181
his crime of killing Myung-seong
Empress, the mother of Korea,


942
01:34:54.872 --> 01:34:58.517
his crime of violently
deposing the Emperor of Korea,


943
01:35:00.382 --> 01:35:05.581

944
01:35:05.819 --> 01:35:11.220
his crime of large-scale
killing innocent Korean


945
01:35:11.712 --> 01:35:16.697

976
01:37:42.403 --> 01:37:45.457
Why are Japanese laws so bad?

977
01:37:45.941 --> 01:37:51.675
To be born as a national of a

is the true glory, which I willingly accept

987
01:38:33.825 --> 01:38:38.559

01:38:55.014 --> 01:38:59.981
Who'd like to punish the people
that fight for the country?


993
01:39:00.006 --> 01:39:04.700
Who is really the sinner?
Who is to be punished?


994
01:39:04.747 --> 01:39:09.677
Do you know the pain of losing a country?
Do you know the pain of losing a country?


995
01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:43.555
Who's the sinner?

996
01:39:45.833 --> 01:39:48.342
The verdict was handed down
without several public trials


997
01:39:48.367 --> 01:39:49.805
There is no such thing under the sun

998
01:39:49.829 --> 01:39:50.829
Yeah

999
01:39:51.257 --> 01:39:53.718
We should go through the
formal process of protesting


1000
01:39:53.743 --> 01:39:56.288
The Japanese cannot
oppose our protest either


1001
01:39:56.313 --> 01:39:59.327
Yeah

1002
01:39:59.352 --> 01:40:00.632
If we protest,

1003
01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:03.781
is there a possibility of
reversing the sentence?


1004
01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:07.098
We also cannot invite Korean lawyers

1005
01:40:08.045 --> 01:40:11.109
So, are we going
to put up with this?

1006
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:13.413
We need try our best to do it!

1007
01:41:40.972 --> 01:41:42.718
Eat something

1008
01:41:43.872 --> 01:41:44.872
Thanks

1009
01:41:46.164 --> 01:41:49.363
Today the news came from
the Japanese lawyers


1010
01:41:49.949 --> 01:41:51.948
that they are preparing
to resist the lawsuit


1011
01:41:52.483 --> 01:41:55.449
and hopefully there will be a good result

1012
01:41:56.273 --> 01:41:57.273
And...

1013
01:41:57.832 --> 01:42:00.747
Your mother wrote a letter for you

1014
01:42:19.328 --> 01:42:21.247
My dear son Da-mo,

1015
01:42:22.889 --> 01:42:28.988
If you think you are ungrateful for
dying earlier than your old mother


1016
01:42:30.563 --> 01:42:32.771
I, your mother, will become a joke

1017
01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:37.552
Your death don't belong to yours alone

1018
01:42:39.206 --> 01:42:43.458
You carry the public anger
of all the Korean people


1019
01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:50.919
If you resist the lawsuit, it is equivalent
to asking the Japanese Empire for your life


1020
01:42:52.905 --> 01:42:56.896
For the sake of the country,
you should not worry much


1021
01:42:58.249 --> 01:42:59.388
Just choose death

1022
01:43:02.202 --> 01:43:04.060
You have done the right
thing to be punished


1023
01:43:05.336 --> 01:43:07.529
Dont beg for your life

1024
01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:12.022
Dying for the righteous cause is the only
way to show filial piety to your mother


1025
01:43:13.782 --> 01:43:20.763
This letter will be the last
letter that I will write to you


1026
01:43:23.269 --> 01:43:26.607
In this life, I'm not looking
forward to meeting you


1027
01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:33.224
In the next life,
you must, as my son,

1028
01:43:34.433 --> 01:43:36.411
come into this world

1029
01:43:52.152 --> 01:43:53.380
How are you going?

1030
01:43:55.158 --> 01:43:56.158
Well

1031
01:43:57.489 --> 01:44:01.302
I'm here today to discuss future protests

1032
01:44:02.036 --> 01:44:06.146
Public opinion in the country is high. People
think you should get a proper trial again


1033
01:44:06.717 --> 01:44:08.161
The situation is not so bad

1034
01:44:08.413 --> 01:44:11.599
So even if it's hard,
you have to keep going


1035
01:44:11.624 --> 01:44:12.675
Jong-geun, Gong-geun,

1036
01:44:14.195 --> 01:44:15.195
- Well
- Huh


1037
01:44:15.428 --> 01:44:18.042
I decided not to protest

1038
01:44:19.907 --> 01:44:21.519
And, I have something to say to you

1039
01:44:22.253 --> 01:44:23.035
Brother,

1040
01:44:23.255 --> 01:44:24.255
after I die

1041
01:44:25.389 --> 01:44:27.964
Please bury my bones next to Harbin Park

1042
01:44:29.253 --> 01:44:30.933
and when our national rights are restored,

1043
01:44:31.228 --> 01:44:32.828
please bring them back to the motherland

1044
01:44:35.013 --> 01:44:37.733
I want to sleep in peace in an
independent and autonomous motherland


1045
01:44:40.024 --> 01:44:41.024
Beg for you

1046
01:45:14.955 --> 01:45:16.582
What are you writing so carefully?

1047
01:45:17.326 --> 01:45:19.863
I'm writing about what I
think of as peace in the East


1048
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.300
Peace in the East?

1049
01:45:21.676 --> 01:45:23.011
What's that?

1050
01:45:26.532 --> 01:45:27.948
Do you have kids?

1051
01:45:28.238 --> 01:45:29.003
No

1052
01:45:29.152 --> 01:45:30.152
Not yet

1053
01:45:33.108 --> 01:45:34.160
In fact,

1054
01:45:35.395 --> 01:45:36.714
I'm a father Of three children

1055
01:45:38.670 --> 01:45:40.378
I wrote this words for that,

1056
01:45:42.557 --> 01:45:46.058
though I killed Hirobumi Ito with my hand,

1057
01:45:47.845 --> 01:45:52.339
I hope that my children can
use their hands for praying.


1058
01:45:53.823 --> 01:45:56.449
This is the peace in East

1059
01:46:00.036 --> 01:46:01.722
I don't hate Japan

1060
01:46:03.283 --> 01:46:05.941
and I also don't hate Japanese,

1061
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:11.238
because we are near neighbor

1062
01:46:12.746 --> 01:46:18.144
I just hate the part Of people
that has imperialist ambitions


1063
01:46:18.786 --> 01:46:19.786
Teacher,

1064
01:46:20.842 --> 01:46:24.722
as a Japanese, 
I make an apology for you

1065
01:46:26.585 --> 01:46:27.585
Sorry

1066
01:46:31.265 --> 01:46:33.136
You have no need to apologize

1067
01:46:34.132 --> 01:46:37.222
It's helpless for you

1068
01:46:42.817 --> 01:46:44.542
Tme is approaching, right?

1069
01:46:46.038 --> 01:46:47.792
Your eyes are dodging

1070
01:46:50.455 --> 01:46:54.462
The execution of the sentence is
expected to take place tomorrow morning


1071
01:46:56.325 --> 01:46:57.325
Sorry

1072
01:46:58.647 --> 01:46:59.647
That's okay

1073
01:47:03.553 --> 01:47:07.160
At last, I prepared a gift for you

1074
01:47:14.235 --> 01:47:16.644
Dedicated to our country, soldier's duty

1075
01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:21.128
Soldier's duty is to
dedicate to his country


1076
01:47:24.033 --> 01:47:24.722
I'll treasure it.

1077
01:47:24.966 --> 01:47:25.966
I'll treasure it.

1078
01:47:26.508 --> 01:47:29.816
Use it to spread your spirit later

1079
01:47:31.358 --> 01:47:34.224
I also have something to give to you,

1080
01:47:45.423 --> 01:47:48.253
which is from you mother

1081
01:48:00.865 --> 01:48:07.746
My son, my dear Da-mo

1082
01:48:08.144 --> 01:48:14.440
It's time to leave

1083
01:48:15.139 --> 01:48:22.136
Though there is no way to
soothe the fearful heart


1084
01:48:22.607 --> 01:48:28.238
I'll summon up my courage

1085
01:48:29.633 --> 01:48:36.550
My son, my dear Da-mo

1086
01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:42.410
It's time to watch you away

1087
01:48:43.631 --> 01:48:50.519
Don't stop, don't look back

1088
01:48:51.146 --> 01:48:55.910
Go and achieve your ambition

1089
01:48:58.207 --> 01:49:05.088
Carry the cross and walk your way

1090
01:49:05.113 --> 01:49:10.753
Even without my companion.

1091
01:49:12.839 --> 01:49:20.394
I'll always pray

1092
01:49:20.419 --> 01:49:26.956
for you

1093
01:49:30.574 --> 01:49:37.892
You left me,

1094
01:49:37.917 --> 01:49:44.683
promise to wait for me

1095
01:49:44.708 --> 01:49:52.347
How short and cruel the relationship is

1096
01:49:52.372 --> 01:49:59.761
You will always be my son

1097
01:49:59.786 --> 01:50:06.894
Just for once, only for once,

1098
01:50:06.919 --> 01:50:14.668
if I could hug you,

1099
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:22.709
I will hug you tightly

1100
01:50:57.823 --> 01:51:03.619
March 26, 1910
China Lvshun Prison


1101
01:51:12.774 --> 01:51:13.806
Captain!

1102
01:51:14.659 --> 01:51:15.871
Captain!

1103
01:51:16.974 --> 01:51:18.307
Ahn!

1104
01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:24.173
Captain Ahn!

1105
01:51:25.074 --> 01:51:27.423
Sir!

1106
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:32.157
Sir!

1107
01:51:32.182 --> 01:51:34.102
Captain!

1108
01:51:35.758 --> 01:51:42.665
Swear to god my ambition

1109
01:51:43.618 --> 01:51:50.383
Give me the last minute

1110
01:51:50.798 --> 01:51:57.665
If I could walk till the end

1111
01:51:58.173 --> 01:52:03.641
Will I achieve my ambition?

1112
01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:12.141
Why do I hold back?

1113
01:52:12.727 --> 01:52:19.571
What am I fearing of?

1114
01:52:20.055 --> 01:52:26.610
I swore to be a man

1115
01:52:27.410 --> 01:52:31.962
Why am I so craven?

1116
01:52:35.618 --> 01:52:37.954
Can't they hear

1117
01:52:38.302 --> 01:52:41.454
my heartbeat?

1118
01:52:42.923 --> 01:52:45.195
Can't they hear

1119
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:48.329
my fearful breath?

1120
01:52:50.138 --> 01:52:53.603
Even the heart of fear

1121
01:52:53.628 --> 01:52:55.758
is forgotten

1122
01:52:57.565 --> 01:53:00.219
The grateful sunshine,

1123
01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:07.298
the warm wind,

1124
01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:17.360
the ambition I swear to god

1125
01:53:18.337 --> 01:53:25.227
Give me the last minute

1126
01:53:25.618 --> 01:53:28.548
I will keep walking

1127
01:53:29.339 --> 01:53:35.410
Will my ambition achieved

1128
01:53:35.435 --> 01:53:39.138
till the end?

1129
01:53:39.599 --> 01:53:46.263
Why do I hold back?

1130
01:53:47.552 --> 01:53:54.145
What am I fearing
of in face of god?

1131
01:53:54.645 --> 01:54:01.231
I swore to be a man

1132
01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:06.520
Don't be afraid

1133
01:54:11.432 --> 01:54:15.349
The anguished pain

1134
01:54:17.039 --> 01:54:20.255
Mother, family

1135
01:54:22.319 --> 01:54:24.255
Opening up my mind

1136
01:54:26.335 --> 01:54:28.168
Standing between life and death

1137
01:54:29.531 --> 01:54:31.730
Seeing today becomes the past.

1138
01:54:33.605 --> 01:54:37.060
What am I thinking?

1139
01:54:44.542 --> 01:54:46.481
Do you have anything left to say?

1140
01:54:54.325 --> 01:55:00.856
Born in this world

1141
01:55:00.881 --> 01:55:06.382
Full of ambition

1142
01:55:06.407 --> 01:55:14.407
Never forget until death

1143
01:55:16.082 --> 01:55:22.055
Swear to god

1144
01:55:22.088 --> 01:55:24.885
Save me

1145
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:30.873
Save our dreams

1146
01:55:30.874 --> 01:55:33.739
God

1147
01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:37.339
Guard me

1148
01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:43.039
Guard our ambitious

1149
01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.473
God

1150
01:55:46.474 --> 01:55:49.939
Save me

1151
01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:55.739
Save our dreams

1152
01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:58.473
God,

1153
01:55:58.474 --> 01:56:01.673
Guard me

1154
01:56:01.674 --> 01:56:07.279
Guard our ambitions

1155
01:56:07.304 --> 01:56:12.029
Achieve my ambition

1156
01:56:13.810 --> 01:56:16.314
Ambitious!

1157
01:56:40.607 --> 01:56:47.106
Japanese buried Ahn Jung-geun's body in an
unknown place. It's still missing today.


1158
01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:53.939
Ahn Jung-geun has yet to return to his
independent homeland Republic of Korea.
