00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:22.075
I was 16 and we were at home

22
00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:26.048
and then they came and they
told her she had to leave,


23
00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:30.051
because she missed an
appointment at the center,


24
00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:32.652
she missed her appointment.

25
00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:36.524
Sometimes I think maybe I
should've gone with her,


26
00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:43.997

There are four of
you, you all have cigarettes


33
00:06:01.502 --> 00:06:03.468
and none of you
have one cigarette?


34
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.003
- No.
- I just have one cigarette.


35
00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:07.572
Okay, seriously,
just pay it forward, bitch,

00:06:07.574 --> 00:06:09.240
- just one.
- Oh, my God.

- Hey!
- What?

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:12.376
Hold on.

I'm sorry, I just wanted to
say, you know, fuck that guy,


42
00:06:20.785 --> 00:06:22.652
alright, you've got your
whole life ahead of you,


43
00:06:22.654 --> 00:06:25.322
you've got a whole line of
options swiping in front of you


44
00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:27.424
and you just have
to learn to let go,

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:31.060
it's like just love again,
you know, you're worth it.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.828
Damn.

47
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.664
Don't worry, okay, I'm
not even here to fuck,


48
00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:38.000
I just do you have
another cigarette, please?


49
00:06:38.002 --> 00:06:40.636
Give me one and then I'll
disappear from your life forever,


50
00:06:40.638 --> 00:06:41.537
alright?

51
00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:42.803
- Bummed, man.
- I don't have any.


52
00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:44.005
- Please, anyone?
- I'll give you one.


53
00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:45.640
Thank you very much.

54
00:06:45.642 --> 00:06:47.308
Will you do the honors?

55
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.476
You know,

56
00:06:48.478 --> 00:06:49.978
karma's really gonna
love you for that.


57
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.013
I bet she will.

58
00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:55.582
Thank you so
much, that's nice.


59
00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:57.453
Hey, hey, what's your name?

60
00:06:58.954 --> 00:07:00.921
Hey, what's your name?

61
00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:03.624
Larry,
nice to meet ya.


62
00:07:03.626 --> 00:07:05.461
Oh, so that's it, come on?

63
00:07:07.996 --> 00:07:11.130
I'm not, like I'm not,
but I'm definitely not.


64
00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:12.498
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.


65
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.033
It's so simple.

66
00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:17.736
When I was a kid,
it was like Chuck E. Cheese.


67
00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:18.937
Chuck E. Cheese, oh, my God!

68
00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.171
Why is the pizza
there like so good?


69
00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:21.439
And the roller rink, we had,

70
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.475
you ever go to the roller rink

71
00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:24.808
and the pizza at
the roller rink,


72
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.978
even though it was the
one in the rectangles,


73
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.414
like that's fucked up,
but I love that pizza.


74
00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:31.649
I actually really love
the rectangle piece,


75
00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:35.486
because you can really kind of
gauge how much you wanna eat.


76
00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.755
I mean, like I'll
finish a slice.


77
00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.057
You're so OCD.

78
00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.525
I'm just saying, you can
really like take charge


79
00:07:42.527 --> 00:07:43.827
of how much you wanna eat.

80
00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.368
- I don't like to waste food.
- Neither do I.


81
00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:54.503
Oh, fuck, you got
all the cheese.


82
00:07:54.505 --> 00:07:56.004
You want some?

83
00:07:56.006 --> 00:07:59.308
No, no, we're not gonna
"Lady and the Tramp" it.


84
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.009
It's a good move.

85
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:02.579
Watch this.

86
00:08:04.014 --> 00:08:06.916
Yeah, I love the crumbs like
on the back of your tongue.


87
00:08:13.822 --> 00:08:18.826
But this monk, like shaved
head, robe, all of that


88
00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:20.894
sitting on the tree next to me

89
00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:23.663
and he just starts
humming loud as fuck.


90
00:08:33.574 --> 00:08:34.807
No good?

91
00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.541
Do you play?

92
00:09:12.543 --> 00:09:13.846
Sometimes.

93
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:17.281
Mostly when I'm alone.

94
00:09:20.884 --> 00:09:22.219
I'm alone a lot,

95
00:09:24.388 --> 00:09:25.655
maybe too much.

96
00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:33.529
Stop.

97
00:09:50.278 --> 00:09:52.547

You know he was blind?

155
00:16:56.135 --> 00:16:59.170
They called him the
Viking of 6th Avenue,


156
00:16:59.172 --> 00:17:02.940
'cause he had these crazy
costumes, big cape, Viking helmet


157
00:17:02.942 --> 00:17:06.242
and he was performing on the
street like a serious composer,


158
00:17:06.244 --> 00:17:07.676
but playing on the street

159
00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:09.645
with homemade
instruments and things.


160

- You ever see him?
- Anybody could see him,


161
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.785
hear his music, if you
were walking on 6th Avenue,


162
00:17:15.787 --> 00:17:17.085
50-something Street.

163
00:17:17.087 --> 00:17:18.954
Was he like a crazy person

164
00:17:18.956 --> 00:17:20.590
or did people take
him seriously?


165
00:17:22.392 --> 00:17:24.694
Ah, pretty close
together, right?


166
00:17:25.728 --> 00:17:26.563
Yeah.

171
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.011
Let their souls run wild.

172
00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:46.246
- Right.
- Yeah,


173
00:17:46.248 --> 00:17:48.083
that's Langston Hughes.

174
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.117
Oh, Langston
Hughes, absolutely.


175
00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:53.685
He's so good,
yeah, yeah, he's prolific too.


176
00:17:53.687 --> 00:17:54.854
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.


177
00:17:54.856 --> 00:17:57.422
I could do $2 on these.

178
00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:59.058
What?

179
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.359
Yeah, I mean, it's
conducing, you know,


180
00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:02.828
- what we have in the shop.
- I mean,


181
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.462
maybe a couple of are worth $2,

182
00:18:05.464 --> 00:18:07.866
but like this is
still in its plastic.


183
00:18:07.868 --> 00:18:09.468
Be yourself, bitch!

184

Get your pussy game up, honey.

185
00:18:13.073 --> 00:18:15.106
Yeah, you need to get
your pussy game up, honey.


186
00:18:15.108 --> 00:18:18.275
Get a job, okay,
get a fucking job.

Look, I
do this all day, good luck.


190
00:18:27.887 --> 00:18:29.417
I'm just worried about you,

191
00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:31.588
'cause karma's gonna
get you for this.


192
00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:37.059
Look, I'm just
trying to run it fair.


193
00:18:37.061 --> 00:18:39.594
How about, I'll do
$4 apiece on these


194
00:18:39.596 --> 00:18:42.264

Nah, if it ain't dollars,
it don't make sense.


198
00:18:49.538 --> 00:18:51.239
- Let's do cash.
- Yeah?

00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:53.342
- Pay me, yeah.
- Alright.

Okay, who the fuck

Who you talking to?

205
00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.452
There ain't nothing
cozy up in here.


206
00:19:07.454 --> 00:19:09.755
We ain't even friends.

207
00:19:09.757 --> 00:19:11.124

00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:18.562
Yes.

211
00:19:18.564 --> 00:19:21.768
Mess with the best,
die like the rest.


212
00:20:33.334 --> 00:20:35.903
From the unforeseen darkness,

213
00:20:37.005 --> 00:20:37.905
a sign.

214
00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:43.910
I claim thee, I
name thee as my own.


215
00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:46.612
Be my guide,

216
00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:50.350
light the shore for those
who are far from home.


217
00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:09.633
Elijah,
be careful up there, okay!


218
00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.237
- Mommy.
- Go slow!


219
00:21:14.406 --> 00:21:16.339
I just don't want
you getting hurt.


220
00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:17.408
No, thank you.

221
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:20.042
Hey.

222
00:21:20.044 --> 00:21:22.210
I really like your jacket.

223
00:21:22.212 --> 00:21:24.146
Thank you, it's
pretty sick, right?


224
00:21:24.148 --> 00:21:25.482
Yeah.

225
00:21:26.784 --> 00:21:29.283
- Yeah, it's from Berlin.
- Nice.


226
00:21:29.285 --> 00:21:31.052
It's German, yeah.

227
00:21:31.054 --> 00:21:32.587
Do you have a cigarette?

228
00:21:34.524 --> 00:21:36.123
Shit,

229
00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:38.061
yeah, yeah.

230
00:21:39.661 --> 00:21:40.996
You got a light?

231
00:21:47.302 --> 00:21:48.600
Thank you.

232
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.206
Oh,

233
00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:55.042
oh, God.

234
00:21:57.111 --> 00:21:58.711
Wish I could still smoke.

235
00:21:59.947 --> 00:22:01.880
It's just so taboo
with kids, you know,


236
00:22:01.882 --> 00:22:03.849
I mean, everything is.

237
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:05.483
I mean, it's not crack, girl,

238
00:22:05.485 --> 00:22:06.951
you don't need to hide it.

239
00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:08.718
I'll tell my husband that

240
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.555
next time he gives
me shit for it.


241
00:22:10.557 --> 00:22:12.557
Hey, you wanna
know what I say?


242
00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.724
I say this every
morning in the mirror.


243
00:22:14.726 --> 00:22:19.329
I do what I want, because I'm
the boss of my whole body.


244
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:20.799
- I like that.
- Yeah.


245
00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:28.906
- I'm the boss.
- Hm-mm, of my whole body.


246
00:22:29.807 --> 00:22:31.540
Hey, Elijah,

247
00:22:31.542 --> 00:22:35.211
we gotta be at yoga class in

248
00:22:35.213 --> 00:22:36.912
No, I hate yoga!

249
00:22:36.914 --> 00:22:38.615
Damn!

250
00:22:40.418 --> 00:22:42.417
You have him living
that good life.


251
00:22:43.954 --> 00:22:46.921
I mean, his teacher
says it's gonna keep him


252
00:22:46.923 --> 00:22:48.523
agreeable and focused,

253
00:22:48.525 --> 00:22:49.759
so namaste.

254
00:22:52.028 --> 00:22:52.862
Namaste.

255
00:22:54.463 --> 00:22:56.263
Here, take this.

256
00:22:56.265 --> 00:22:58.532
Okay, this is what I heard,

257
00:22:58.534 --> 00:23:01.034
you can't change in a day

258
00:23:01.036 --> 00:23:02.369
and sometimes you hit a point,

259
00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:05.838
where the only way
forward is inward.


260
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.773
That's what this monk told me.

261
00:23:07.775 --> 00:23:09.475
No, for real.

262
00:23:09.477 --> 00:23:10.677
- A monk, huh?
- Hm-mm.


263
00:23:13.548 --> 00:23:15.214
I used to do yoga

264
00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:17.449
and meditate and go
on retreats and stuff,


265
00:23:17.451 --> 00:23:19.820
but then he came along

266
00:23:21.288 --> 00:23:23.557
and it all just fell apart.

267
00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:25.792
What?

268
00:23:30.229 --> 00:23:31.694
Um.

269
00:23:31.696 --> 00:23:33.933
Don't trip too hard on this
mothering business, okay,


270
00:23:35.334 --> 00:23:36.567
because you don't know,

271
00:23:36.569 --> 00:23:38.337
one day that shit
just gonna be gone.


272
00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:41.840
I mean, I wish that were true.

273
00:23:45.544 --> 00:23:46.744
Wait, really?

274
00:23:50.315 --> 00:23:53.849
Like sometimes I just
wake up in the morning


275
00:23:53.851 --> 00:23:55.920
and it's so quiet

276
00:23:57.955 --> 00:24:02.725
and I have this thought that
like I wish he'd run away.


277
00:24:04.195 --> 00:24:05.159
- For real?
- Yeah,


278
00:24:05.161 --> 00:24:08.064
I just want him to be gone.

279
00:24:09.432 --> 00:24:11.034
Like I'm a monster.

280
00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:18.941
Hey, don't cry,
please don't cry.


281
00:24:20.741 --> 00:24:21.877
You're not a monster,

282
00:24:23.278 --> 00:24:25.744
you're not a
monster, you're just,


283
00:24:25.746 --> 00:24:28.381
you're just some
ugly tree, I'm sorry.


284
00:24:28.383 --> 00:24:30.683
- What?
- I'm sorry.


285
00:24:30.685 --> 00:24:32.318
I'm sorry, you are,

286
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.655
like look at these trees,
they're fucking ugly.


287
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.591
You know, like 'cause
the winter came


288
00:24:38.593 --> 00:24:39.992
and like all the leaves are gone

289
00:24:39.994 --> 00:24:42.460
and so they're bald
and they're cold


290
00:24:42.462 --> 00:24:45.430
and they're like
skeletons, you know.


291
00:24:45.432 --> 00:24:47.767
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to hurt you with that.


292
00:24:48.868 --> 00:24:50.702
It's just hard being a tree.

293
00:24:50.704 --> 00:24:52.370
It's really hard being a tree,

294
00:24:52.372 --> 00:24:55.472
in the winter it's
really hard being a tree,


295
00:24:55.474 --> 00:24:56.775
you're stripped,

296
00:24:59.178 --> 00:25:02.012
but like it's gonna be,
you know, summer soon


297
00:25:02.014 --> 00:25:04.214
and he's gonna be 18 soon and
then you'll be summer forever.


298
00:25:04.216 --> 00:25:08.117
Smoking causes one in five
deaths in America each year.


299
00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:09.919
Okay, we're gonna leave
in just a second, okay.


300
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:11.320
- No, right now!
- Hey!


301
00:25:11.322 --> 00:25:12.455
I'm sorry, go on.

302
00:25:12.457 --> 00:25:13.489
Surprise!

303
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.124
- Yo, give me that!
- Hey!


304
00:25:15.126 --> 00:25:16.158
- Hey!
- Get back here!


305
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.059
That's not funny, hey!

306
00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:19.561
- It's mine, it's mine!
- Oh, Jesus, Elijah!


307
00:25:19.563 --> 00:25:21.496
- It's mine, it's mine!
- You need to handle your son.


308
00:25:21.498 --> 00:25:23.665
- Don't tell me how to parent.
- Get out of there now!


309
00:25:25.636 --> 00:25:29.370
Give it back, give it
back to me, give it back!


310
00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.295
I thought I was kinda going
crazy, I was losing my mind,


311
00:25:56.297 --> 00:25:57.796
that's how cold it was,

312
00:25:57.798 --> 00:25:59.264
because I'm saying
to myself, you know,


313
00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:00.465
girl, you don't
have to be out here,


314
00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:02.034
but then you're
saying to yourself,


315
00:26:02.036 --> 00:26:03.602
girl, but where you gonna go?

316
00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:05.636
'Cause whose door you knock on

317
00:26:05.638 --> 00:26:08.072
at three o'clock in the morning
in Park Slope, you know,


318
00:26:08.074 --> 00:26:09.507
calls and knocks on the door

319
00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:13.012
are like deaths and having
a baby, so you know.


320
00:26:15.214 --> 00:26:17.047
It took a while
to shake that off,


321
00:26:17.049 --> 00:26:19.282
because that was something
that I could say to myself,


322
00:26:19.284 --> 00:26:21.718
that I never wanna
experience again, never,


323
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.353
there's nothing like being warm

324
00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:25.155
and people complain
about the summer,


325
00:26:25.157 --> 00:26:28.058
there's nothing like being
warm, trust me, when I tell ya.


326
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.225
First the overview

327
00:26:30.227 --> 00:26:32.361
on this powerful nor'easter
that's on the way,


328
00:26:32.363 --> 00:26:35.799
it's gonna produce heavy
snow, powerful winds,


329
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:37.366
put the two together
and for many of us


330
00:26:37.368 --> 00:26:39.935
at times blizzard conditions.

Potato rolls, I want them!

357
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.110
Wait, wait, wait!

358
00:28:38.112 --> 00:28:39.411
Look at this bitch
right here.


359
00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:41.379
Are you
sure that's a she?


360
00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:43.414
She's probably got a
bigger dick than this guy.


361
00:28:44.584 --> 00:28:46.184
Hey babe, you
looking for something to eat?


362
00:28:46.186 --> 00:28:48.787
I got something
for you right here.


363
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:50.655
Whoa, cut that shit out, man,

364
00:28:50.657 --> 00:28:51.924
- there's people around.
- Fuck that,


365
00:28:51.926 --> 00:28:53.791
I'm not leaving
till she answers me.


366
00:28:53.793 --> 00:28:55.992
Hey babe, can you
fucking hear me?


367
00:28:55.994 --> 00:28:57.696
Hey babe, can you
fucking hear me?


368
00:28:58.564 --> 00:28:59.398
Woo!

369
00:29:00.532 --> 00:29:02.599
Hey, bitch, answer
me, answer me!


370
00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:04.100
Oh, there he goes.

371
00:29:04.102 --> 00:29:05.201
- Come on.
- Watch out, babe.


372
00:29:05.203 --> 00:29:10.074
Come on, answer me.

373
00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:18.513
You know, all of these people

374
00:29:18.515 --> 00:29:20.749
are going to all these places

375
00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:22.920
are really all
just going nowhere.


376
00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:35.698
I said all these people, you
know, they're talking, moving,


377
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.568
laughing, breathing, but
they've never left home.


378
00:29:41.971 --> 00:29:43.436
They're all just in a bubble,

379
00:29:43.438 --> 00:29:47.075
they just go from a box
to a tunnel to a box,


380
00:29:48.376 --> 00:29:50.011
they're all blind.

381
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.378
Yeah, you know what they say?

382
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.181
In the land of the blind,
the cyclops is king.


383
00:29:58.352 --> 00:30:01.319
You see, a jail
cell's just a vessel,


384
00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:03.054
if the ocean is your mind

385
00:30:03.056 --> 00:30:05.089
and once I realized
that, I set sail.


386
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.533
If I see your
fucking face again, bitch.


387
00:30:16.535 --> 00:30:17.870
Morning, Mama.

388
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.874
Almost there, Mama.

389
00:30:24.142 --> 00:30:25.608
Almost.

390
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.377
Get your pussy game on, honey.

391
00:30:42.292 --> 00:30:45.459
- Okay, Yasmine, it says...
- That's not my fucking name.


392
00:30:45.461 --> 00:30:46.995
- It says here...
- It's not my name,


393
00:30:46.997 --> 00:30:48.462
- that's not my name.
- Is this you?


394
00:30:48.464 --> 00:30:51.033
Fucking out of here, I don't
know who the fuck you are,


395
00:30:51.035 --> 00:30:52.733
but you are not
listening, bitch.


396
00:30:52.735 --> 00:30:55.903
What you should be asking is
where are those motherfuckers?


397
00:30:55.905 --> 00:30:58.071
Where can we find
those motherfuckers,


398
00:30:58.073 --> 00:31:00.073
who beat the shit out
of you and speaking of,


399
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:02.709
where are the goddam
police, huh, where, where?


400
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:04.410
Yasmine,
shouting at me


401
00:31:04.412 --> 00:31:06.378
isn't gonna get this
done any faster,


402
00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.080
unless of course you
wanna be pink-banded


403
00:31:08.082 --> 00:31:09.615
and sent to the psych unit.

404
00:31:09.617 --> 00:31:12.886
Faster, the only thing
I want faster is justice!


405
00:31:12.888 --> 00:31:15.021
Okay, what don't you
understand about that?


406
00:31:15.023 --> 00:31:17.188
Look at my face,

407
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.224
look at my hands, look at
that, look at that shit.


408
00:31:20.226 --> 00:31:22.061
What about those
white motherfuckers,


409
00:31:22.063 --> 00:31:23.328
who beat the shit of me,

410
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.396
why aren't we talking
about where they live?


411
00:31:26.666 --> 00:31:27.599
Oh, you're really
gonna answer that?


412
00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:28.800
Okay, so you really don't care.

413
00:31:28.802 --> 00:31:29.834
You're really gonna
take a fucking.


414
00:31:29.836 --> 00:31:32.036
You really don't fucking care.

415
00:31:32.038 --> 00:31:32.973
Alright, bye.

416
00:31:35.107 --> 00:31:37.509
It says here you have
an aunt in Jersey.


417
00:31:40.013 --> 00:31:41.646
I urge you to call her.

418
00:31:43.348 --> 00:31:47.416
Take this and about the
police investigation,


419
00:31:47.418 --> 00:31:49.619
a police officer will call
you later in the week,


420
00:31:49.621 --> 00:31:52.989
which is why I need
your current address,


421
00:31:52.991 --> 00:31:54.358
can you do that for me?

422
00:31:56.627 --> 00:31:58.627
Well, if you change your mind,

423
00:31:58.629 --> 00:32:00.195
you have that phone number there

424
00:32:00.197 --> 00:32:03.933
and I have some pamphlets
here for shelters


425
00:32:03.935 --> 00:32:05.967
emergency medical
services, if you need it.


426
00:32:05.969 --> 00:32:07.938
I want you to keep
these with you, okay.


427
00:32:11.307 --> 00:32:14.011
Yasmine, is there anything
else I can do for you today?


428
00:32:17.545 --> 00:32:18.380
What is it?

429
00:32:24.619 --> 00:32:26.419
I just need a tampon.

430
00:32:26.421 --> 00:32:28.821
Okay, I have one.

431
00:33:17.868 --> 00:33:22.740
Stand one train to 242nd Street

432
00:33:23.473 --> 00:33:24.672

433
00:33:24.674 --> 00:33:28.012
please stand away from
the platform edge.


434
00:33:29.445 --> 00:33:32.245
Hi, excuse me, do any
of you guys have a swipe?


435
00:33:32.247 --> 00:33:34.347
Do any of you guys have a swipe?

436
00:33:34.349 --> 00:33:36.616
Do any of you guys have a swipe?

437
00:33:45.426 --> 00:33:49.129
Hey, do any of you
guys have a swipe?


438
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:51.430
ANNOUNCER ON PR
SYSTEM: 242nd Street


439
00:33:51.432 --> 00:33:52.630
approaching the station,

440
00:33:52.632 --> 00:33:55.937
please stand away from
the platform edge.


441
00:33:58.572 --> 00:34:00.742
Hi, do you have a swipe?

442
00:34:08.148 --> 00:34:10.150
hi, do you have a swipe?

443
00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:27.933
I was standing in a doorway

444
00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:30.667
the other night

445
00:34:31.535 --> 00:34:33.770
just waiting for time to pass

446
00:34:33.772 --> 00:34:38.777
and I was so cold, I can
remember being so cold.


447
00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:43.044
You know, at my age
you're never cold,


448
00:34:43.046 --> 00:34:47.017
'cause you're always
having fucking hot flashes


449
00:34:48.218 --> 00:34:52.088
and I was so cold and I
just wanted to be warm,


450
00:34:53.923 --> 00:34:56.422
I just wanted to be,
you know what I wanted?


451
00:34:56.424 --> 00:34:58.859
I wanted someone
to take care of me,


452
00:34:58.861 --> 00:35:01.030
I just wanted someone
to take care of me.


453
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:09.691
- I like your outfit, Mommy.
- Oh, thank you.


454
00:36:09.693 --> 00:36:11.658
It's like a beautiful rainbow,

455
00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.560
that came to wash
away all the rain.


456
00:36:14.898 --> 00:36:16.697
- Yeah.
- Aren't you cold?


457
00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:17.931
Yeah.

458
00:36:17.933 --> 00:36:19.969
Yeah, no, no, I just.

459
00:36:23.538 --> 00:36:25.005
I'm sorry, do you have a phone?

460
00:36:25.007 --> 00:36:27.406
I just need to make a
phone call, is that okay?


461
00:36:27.408 --> 00:36:28.673
Yeah?

462
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:39.354
Thank you, thank you so much.

463
00:36:42.322 --> 00:36:46.691
You hungry?

464
00:36:46.693 --> 00:36:47.627
Come, come.

465
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:07.810
Thank you.

466
00:37:09.014 --> 00:37:11.580
And say
your name now, come on.


467
00:37:12.817 --> 00:37:15.218
Come on, sweetie.

468
00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.387
- No.
- No, no, don't worry.


469
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.758
It's cold outside, I
know, it's really cold.


470
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.660
Don't worry about it,
baby, don't worry about it.


471
00:37:28.064 --> 00:37:28.898
Okay, you'll be okay.

472
00:37:29.933 --> 00:37:32.302
I'll make you
something to eat, okay.


473
00:37:33.468 --> 00:37:36.636
Put on serial, you can
watch whatever you want.


474
00:37:36.638 --> 00:37:38.873
Don't worry.

475
00:37:58.458 --> 00:38:01.228
- Something to help you?
- Si, here.


476
00:38:02.763 --> 00:38:05.229
Cut up these cucumbers for me.

477
00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:17.908
What's your name?

478
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:20.877
My name
is Aurora, Aurora.


479
00:38:20.879 --> 00:38:23.579
- Aurora?
- Yes, like the borealis,


480
00:38:23.581 --> 00:38:25.648
the lights that come
up before the sun.


481
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:28.718
Yeah, that's beautiful,
that's so beautiful.


482
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.188
That's my name, what's your
name, where are you from?


483
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.323
Yasmine, but
people call me Yas.


484
00:38:34.325 --> 00:38:36.491
- Yas?
- Yas, yeah.


485
00:38:36.493 --> 00:38:39.263
Yas, like the
music, I love jazz.


486
00:38:40.163 --> 00:38:41.963
- Yeah.
- I love Yas.


487
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.136
You remind me of my daughter.

488
00:38:47.004 --> 00:38:48.169
- No, uh-uh.
- Yes.


489
00:38:48.171 --> 00:38:50.438
She's a beautiful dancer,

490
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.573
she's like you, skinny
assy, the same color eyes.


491
00:38:53.575 --> 00:38:54.708
No.

492
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.710
- But she dance.
- She doesn't have, no.


493
00:38:56.712 --> 00:38:59.813
No, don't worry about
that, that gets better.


494
00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:01.647
You have beautiful
eyes, don't worry,


495
00:39:01.649 --> 00:39:03.717
you have beautiful eyes.

496
00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:06.185
You know, onion
makes your eyes cry,


497
00:39:06.187 --> 00:39:08.388
- so this is a little secret.
- Okay.


498
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:10.589
If you put on the flame,

499
00:39:10.591 --> 00:39:13.495
everything goes to the flame
and you don't cry, watch.


500
00:39:15.763 --> 00:39:18.163
See, you're not crying, right.

501
00:39:18.165 --> 00:39:19.698
- No.
- Neither am I.


502
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.035
You know, my Mom
used to make the best rice.


503
00:39:23.037 --> 00:39:24.269
- Really?
- Yeah,


504
00:39:24.271 --> 00:39:25.871
she would make this
rice with coconut.


505
00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:28.406
Oh, that's what
I use, I use coconut too.


506
00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:29.606
- You use coconut?
- Yes.


507
00:39:29.608 --> 00:39:32.176
And it's like candy,
it's like so good.


508
00:39:32.178 --> 00:39:36.080
So good, I know, so good.

509
00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:38.916
Now, you smell the coconut,
be careful with your hair.


510
00:39:38.918 --> 00:39:40.719
- Thank you.
- Be careful.


511
00:39:43.221 --> 00:39:46.256
Today it's a church, but
back then it was called


512
00:39:46.258 --> 00:39:48.324
- the Park Palace.
- Where was it?


513
00:39:48.326 --> 00:39:50.960
On 110th and 5th
Avenue right around here,


514
00:39:50.962 --> 00:39:52.428
- three blocks down.
- Yeah?


515
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:55.030
Yeah, a few blocks
from where I met you


516
00:39:55.032 --> 00:39:59.268
and there all the
artists used to go there,


517
00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.071
Tito Puente,
everybody went there,


518
00:40:02.073 --> 00:40:04.672
it wasn't called salsa then,
it was called Latin music.


519
00:40:04.674 --> 00:40:06.207
Okay.

520
00:40:06.209 --> 00:40:09.844
And everybody knew how to
Latin, especially in Harlem,


521
00:40:09.846 --> 00:40:11.913
all the guys knew how to Latin.

522
00:40:11.915 --> 00:40:15.882
In the '70s a big thing happened,
there was birth control,


523
00:40:15.884 --> 00:40:18.819
so that was like
if there was a cage


524
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:22.055
and they let the cage open and
they let all the women out.


525
00:40:22.057 --> 00:40:24.860
So now we could dress
however we wanted


526
00:40:26.295 --> 00:40:28.828
and we had all these
freedoms, you know,


527
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.931
it was sex, drugs
and rock and roll,


528
00:40:31.933 --> 00:40:34.467
but in our world, it was
sex, drugs and salsa.


529
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.971
Women wanted to come
on their own, you know,


530
00:40:38.973 --> 00:40:41.605
especially white women, so
they were burning their bras


531
00:40:41.607 --> 00:40:44.845
and they were saying that
women should have equality.


532
00:40:46.746 --> 00:40:48.046
But they didn't know
what it was like


533
00:40:48.048 --> 00:40:50.250
to walk across 110th Street,

534
00:40:51.784 --> 00:40:53.717
they didn't know
what it was like


535
00:40:53.719 --> 00:40:57.521
to be in a club
with a bunch of men,


536
00:40:57.523 --> 00:41:01.291
where they ruled, they
bought the drinks,


537
00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:03.695
we had to sit there and
look pretty and dance


538
00:41:05.964 --> 00:41:10.935
and they didn't know what
our reality was like,


539
00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.302
but then we had another
time of freedom,


540
00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.904
we had a freedom in our culture,

541
00:41:14.906 --> 00:41:16.705
we had a freedom in our dance,

542
00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:19.374
we had a freedom in our music.

543
00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:23.245
Only in this country do they
seperate people and music


544
00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:25.447
like they do with TV dinners,

545
00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:28.015
I never seen such a
thing like TV dinners,


546
00:41:28.017 --> 00:41:30.050
you put the bread
here and the rice here


547
00:41:30.052 --> 00:41:31.685
and we don't eat like that,

548
00:41:31.687 --> 00:41:33.821
look at how we eat, we put
everything on one plate.


549
00:41:33.823 --> 00:41:36.123
Did you
ever get married?


550
00:41:36.125 --> 00:41:38.728
Oh yes, I was married,
yes, I was married,


551
00:41:39.895 --> 00:41:43.196
but my husband is
not around anymore,


552
00:41:43.198 --> 00:41:47.867
mu husband died, so it
was rough back here,


553
00:41:47.869 --> 00:41:49.435
back then it was very rough,

554
00:41:49.437 --> 00:41:53.307
there were many street
fights and gunfights


555
00:41:54.575 --> 00:41:57.678
and he was shot once, so

556
00:41:59.146 --> 00:42:02.314
and I loved him so much,
but what are you gonna do?


557
00:42:02.316 --> 00:42:03.484
You gotta keep going,

558
00:42:05.084 --> 00:42:09.353
so we kept going and I
raised my little girl,


559
00:42:09.355 --> 00:42:12.723
she's in Puerto
Rico and we're okay.


560
00:42:12.725 --> 00:42:16.862
Eat, eat, eat, eat, now
you're gonna be okay, yes?


561
00:42:18.363 --> 00:42:19.198
Yeah.

562
00:42:24.671 --> 00:42:27.337
I remember when my
children were little,


563
00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:30.706
after we would eat, I
would take the furniture


564
00:42:30.708 --> 00:42:35.411
and I'd put it up against
the walls here by the kitchen


565
00:42:35.413 --> 00:42:39.215
and open up the space
and we would dance


566
00:42:39.217 --> 00:42:43.053
and sing and play
records all day long.


567
00:42:48.925 --> 00:42:49.793
Dinah Washington.

568
00:42:50.827 --> 00:42:52.127
What a voice.

569
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:55.798
Let's see.

570
00:42:59.902 --> 00:43:02.736
Yes, did you ever see a little
record like this before?


571
00:43:02.738 --> 00:43:04.737
You never saw these, right?

572
00:43:04.739 --> 00:43:05.540
Look.

573
00:43:11.246 --> 00:43:12.046
Okay.

574
00:43:19.286 --> 00:43:20.287
There it is.

575
00:43:25.993 --> 00:43:26.827
Come.

576
00:43:28.527 --> 00:43:29.929
Come, come, come.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.034

Hi, I'm Noah,
don't be alarmed.


618
00:48:38.013 --> 00:48:40.311
She did a good thing
here by calling us,

we're here to help.

Yas,
please, listen to them,


621
00:48:44.852 --> 00:48:46.652
they're from the church.

622

Judas!

624
00:48:52.324 --> 00:48:55.626
Aracely wants us to
take you to a safe place.


625
00:48:55.628 --> 00:48:58.361
You don't have to stay,
if you don't want to.


626
00:48:58.363 --> 00:49:00.564
I just need a ride home

627
00:49:00.566 --> 00:49:02.967
and some like money
for the train,


628
00:49:02.969 --> 00:49:06.838
because I actually have
somewhere I need to be.


629
00:49:08.205 --> 00:49:11.675
You don't have to do
anything you don't wanna do,


630
00:49:11.677 --> 00:49:14.276
but it's a Code Blue and
I think you'll agree,


631
00:49:14.278 --> 00:49:16.747
we're a better option
than the police.


632
00:49:22.887 --> 00:49:24.252
First the overview

633
00:49:24.254 --> 00:49:25.821
on this powerful nor'easter
that's on the way,


634
00:49:25.823 --> 00:49:28.690
it's gonna produce heavy
snow, powerful winds,


635
00:49:28.692 --> 00:49:30.424
put the two together
and for many of us


636
00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:31.993
at times blizzard conditions,

637
00:49:31.995 --> 00:49:33.995
that's when it's
really gonna get...


638
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.599
A major and powerful nor'easter.

639
00:49:39.601 --> 00:49:41.802
There's a storm
coming, a big one,


640
00:49:41.804 --> 00:49:43.536
it's Code Blue right now.

641
00:49:43.538 --> 00:49:46.940
We wanna make sure that
we're here to help anyone.


642
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.407
It's your lucky day,

643
00:49:48.409 --> 00:49:51.345
we've got something really
special going on at the Mission.


644
00:49:59.386 --> 00:50:01.723
You'll love this, I promise.

645
00:50:03.024 --> 00:50:04.421
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi!


646
00:50:04.423 --> 00:50:06.091
This is Yasmine.

647
00:50:06.093 --> 00:50:07.558
- Hi, Yasmine!
- Pleased to meet you.


648
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.294
You're gonna be in great
hands, this is Olivia.


649
00:50:10.296 --> 00:50:12.631
Thank you, Noah.

650
00:50:12.633 --> 00:50:14.531

651
00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:16.466

First
question, very simple,


664
00:50:50.801 --> 00:50:52.633
what's today kind of
make you feel like,


665
00:50:52.635 --> 00:50:55.136
what's today feel like?

666
00:50:55.138 --> 00:50:56.204
Different.

667
00:50:57.239 --> 00:50:58.473
- Different?
- Different.


668
00:50:59.909 --> 00:51:03.643
So could you say
today makes you feel different?


669
00:51:03.645 --> 00:51:06.178
Yeah, today makes
me feel different.


670
00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.749
Cool, does
it motivate you at all?


671
00:51:09.751 --> 00:51:12.284
I don't know, how?

672
00:51:12.286 --> 00:51:16.722
I mean, does
it motivate you to change?


673
00:51:16.724 --> 00:51:18.289
- I don't know what...
- Francis.


674
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:20.092
Change what?

675
00:51:20.094 --> 00:51:23.194
Guys, I think
I'd like to try this


676
00:51:23.196 --> 00:51:24.697
just one on one with Yas.

677
00:51:24.699 --> 00:51:26.499
That's not my name.

678
00:51:27.767 --> 00:51:29.268
- Yas is not your name?
- No.


679
00:51:30.704 --> 00:51:33.203
Well, no, if I've got your
name wrong, you gotta tell me.


680
00:51:33.205 --> 00:51:34.206
What's your name?

681
00:51:36.475 --> 00:51:37.509
Sabina.

682
00:51:38.745 --> 00:51:40.911
Sabina?

683
00:51:40.913 --> 00:51:44.147
Nice, I like that.

684
00:51:44.149 --> 00:51:46.382
Is that Greek?

685
00:51:46.384 --> 00:51:47.518
I don't know,

686
00:51:49.554 --> 00:51:52.121
I didn't give it to myself,
my Mom gave it to me.


687
00:51:52.123 --> 00:51:55.026
Alright, so
what I want you to do


688
00:51:56.326 --> 00:51:57.729
is to close your eyes,

689
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:00.595
close your eyes,

690
00:52:00.597 --> 00:52:03.633
wait, they're open,
close 'em and hold 'em.


691
00:52:07.704 --> 00:52:08.504
Breathe in.

692
00:52:10.874 --> 00:52:15.410
Exhale, okay, I want you
to forget about everything.


693
00:52:16.645 --> 00:52:19.579
Imagine you're in a
really nice place,


694
00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:22.718
better than nice,
maybe it's a beach


695
00:52:24.086 --> 00:52:27.352
with white sands and blue skies,

696
00:52:27.354 --> 00:52:30.457
you can feel the sand
between your toes.


697
00:52:33.695 --> 00:52:38.700
Off in the distance, you
hear the sound of laughter,


698
00:52:39.733 --> 00:52:44.636
loving, gentle laughter.

699
00:52:44.638 --> 00:52:45.471
Who is it?

700
00:52:48.942 --> 00:52:49.743
Okay.

701
00:52:50.611 --> 00:52:51.778
Just focus,

702
00:52:53.512 --> 00:52:56.448
focus and relax.

703
00:53:00.385 --> 00:53:02.454
It's a familiar voice.

704
00:53:04.689 --> 00:53:06.421
The laughter stops

705
00:53:06.423 --> 00:53:09.728
and a familiar voice
whispers in your ear.


706
00:53:13.832 --> 00:53:15.266
Who is that voice?

707
00:53:30.814 --> 00:53:31.648
It's okay.

708
00:53:42.124 --> 00:53:42.958
It's okay.

709
00:53:47.162 --> 00:53:47.996
It's Mom.

710
00:53:51.132 --> 00:53:52.934
It's your Mom?

711
00:53:56.336 --> 00:53:57.872
What does she say?

712
00:54:02.643 --> 00:54:05.645
She's smiling at you
and she is so beautiful,


713
00:54:08.248 --> 00:54:09.415
beautiful like you.

714
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.621
Now what's she wearing?

715
00:54:17.156 --> 00:54:18.257
Look closely.

716
00:54:24.429 --> 00:54:26.665
She wants you to see her.

717
00:54:30.702 --> 00:54:31.736
She's wearing...

718
00:54:34.138 --> 00:54:35.106
Yep?

719
00:54:36.241 --> 00:54:38.508
She's wearing like a red,

720
00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.645
like a red dress

721
00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:48.986
and she's got like flowers on it

722
00:54:54.023 --> 00:54:58.761
and this ring with this
little diamond on the setting


723
00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:02.665
and then this other
ring on this hand.


724
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.401
Stare into her eyes.

725
00:55:17.912 --> 00:55:21.715
Mother and daughter, you're
together in your place.


726
00:55:27.186 --> 00:55:29.720
Do you feel it, are you there?

727
00:55:29.722 --> 00:55:30.555
Yeah.

728
00:55:31.791 --> 00:55:34.526
Now tell
me, where is that place?


729
00:55:39.965 --> 00:55:43.602
It was like Christmas Eve
and we had to go to the church


730
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:49.339
and I fucking hated that,
but then when we were there,


731
00:55:49.341 --> 00:55:52.442
she was like crying
during the service


732
00:55:53.443 --> 00:55:55.313
and I felt so stupid.

733
00:55:57.248 --> 00:55:59.214
Try to
look me in the eyes,


734
00:55:59.216 --> 00:56:00.550
when you talk about this,

735
00:56:02.819 --> 00:56:05.286
'cause these stories,

736
00:56:05.288 --> 00:56:08.222
you wanna tell people,
you know, these are in you


737
00:56:08.224 --> 00:56:10.191
and when you can look
someone in the eyes


738
00:56:10.193 --> 00:56:13.763
and tell them, it helps so much.

739
00:56:14.997 --> 00:56:16.863
- Okay.
- You know?


740
00:56:16.865 --> 00:56:18.598
So what happened at the church?

741
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.002
There was just,

742
00:56:21.904 --> 00:56:23.770
it was just Christmas Eve

743
00:56:23.772 --> 00:56:26.975
and that's all, she
just wanted me to go


744
00:56:28.643 --> 00:56:30.710
and I didn't, but I
was being mean to her


745
00:56:30.712 --> 00:56:33.779
and then when we got
there, she was so happy


746
00:56:33.781 --> 00:56:37.719
and she was crying during the
service and I felt so bad.


747
00:56:40.754 --> 00:56:42.555
What would she,

748
00:56:43.724 --> 00:56:45.522
what would you guys talk about,

749
00:56:45.524 --> 00:56:47.592
what would she say
at that church?


750
00:56:47.594 --> 00:56:50.763
She just would say that,
you know, she loved me.


751
00:56:53.132 --> 00:56:55.634
And what
would you say to her?


752
00:56:57.169 --> 00:56:58.635
Right now?

753
00:56:58.637 --> 00:57:00.740
Yeah, what would
you say to your Mom right now?


754
00:57:05.844 --> 00:57:07.912
I just really miss you.

755
00:57:12.017 --> 00:57:15.652
I really miss you, that's all.

756
00:57:20.556 --> 00:57:22.057
I love you, you know,

757
00:57:22.059 --> 00:57:25.729
it was really fucked up,
it was really fucked up.


758
00:57:34.003 --> 00:57:37.171
So what would
your Mom say to you right now,


759
00:57:37.173 --> 00:57:39.074
if she could hear you say that?

760
00:57:42.444 --> 00:57:45.280
She'd say I'm
sorry too, it sucks.


761
00:57:50.252 --> 00:57:51.919
She didn't wanna go.

762
00:57:53.487 --> 00:57:56.522
Would she want you
to come to wherever she is?


763
00:57:56.524 --> 00:57:59.158
Yeah,

764
00:57:59.160 --> 00:57:59.994
yeah.

765
00:58:04.064 --> 00:58:05.530
I don't know where she.

766
00:58:05.532 --> 00:58:07.801
When was the
last time you saw your Mom?


767
00:58:08.668 --> 00:58:11.402
I was 16 and we were at home

768
00:58:11.404 --> 00:58:15.340
and then they came and they
told her she had to leave,


769
00:58:16.842 --> 00:58:19.378
because she missed an
appointment at the center,


770
00:58:20.579 --> 00:58:22.014
she missed her appointment.

771
00:58:23.582 --> 00:58:27.083
What kind
of center was that?


772
00:58:27.085 --> 00:58:28.252
Immigration.

773
00:58:30.755 --> 00:58:34.225
And what were you
doing, when they took her?


774
00:58:36.694 --> 00:58:37.528
I was hid...

775
00:58:40.797 --> 00:58:42.263
You were hot

776
00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:43.967
- or you were high?
- I was hiding.


777
00:58:46.203 --> 00:58:48.703
Would they
have taken you too?


778
00:58:48.705 --> 00:58:50.971
I don't know.

779
00:58:50.973 --> 00:58:53.676
Sometimes I think maybe I
should've gone with her.


780
00:58:56.145 --> 00:58:57.513
I don't know.

781
00:58:59.715 --> 00:59:02.617
I don't even know
where she was taken to.


782
00:59:09.657 --> 00:59:12.627
I just, I just really
miss her, that's all


783
00:59:14.429 --> 00:59:18.432
and I'm figuring it out,
it's okay, I got this.


784
00:59:20.234 --> 00:59:23.468
Listen, what happened
to you is not your fault


785
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:26.906
and no matter what you
think, we're here for you


786
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.207
and my staff will
do everything we can


787
00:59:30.209 --> 00:59:32.042
to help you find your mother,

788
00:59:32.044 --> 00:59:35.012
but it's gonna take a lot of
time and a lot of hard work.


789
00:59:35.014 --> 00:59:38.215
No, I don't have any
time, I don't have any time,


790
00:59:38.217 --> 00:59:41.052
I have been waiting
since I was 16, okay


791
00:59:42.454 --> 00:59:46.024
and I have been out here
all by myself doing it alone


792
00:59:47.159 --> 00:59:49.327
and every time there
has been a helping hand,


793
00:59:50.528 --> 00:59:52.029
it's had a razor blade in it.

794
00:59:54.899 --> 00:59:57.833
Listen, I understand,
trust me, I do.


795
00:59:57.835 --> 00:59:59.034
No, no.

796
00:59:59.036 --> 01:00:00.738
How many years
have you been alone?


797
01:00:01.606 --> 01:00:03.037
Where's your mother?

798
01:00:03.039 --> 01:00:05.206
Do you even have a plan?

799
01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:08.676
What, march into the blizzard
and hope for the best?


800
01:00:08.678 --> 01:00:11.546
If you leave now, you're
gonna be on your own


801
01:00:11.548 --> 01:00:13.651
and there's nothing
we can do to help you.


802
01:00:20.122 --> 01:00:22.758
But if you stay,
there's an open bed,


803
01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:24.627
okay?

804
01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:44.264
Fuck!

805
01:01:44.266 --> 01:01:45.100
Fuck!

806
01:01:53.474 --> 01:01:54.308
Shit.

807
01:02:12.258 --> 01:02:13.560
Oh, my God, yes!

808
01:02:15.894 --> 01:02:16.729
Oh, shit.

809
01:03:20.153 --> 01:03:21.689
It's your place now.

810
01:03:36.803 --> 01:03:37.637
Fuck!

811
01:03:43.676 --> 01:03:46.643
Remove your hats,
your scarves, your shoes


812
01:03:46.645 --> 01:03:48.544
and place them in the bin.

813
01:03:48.546 --> 01:03:52.114
Keep the line moving, ladies,
we don't wanna be cold either.


814
01:03:52.116 --> 01:03:55.183
No booze, no drugs,

815
01:03:55.185 --> 01:03:58.186
no pets, no outside blankets,

816
01:03:58.188 --> 01:04:01.990
any and all contraband
will be confiscated.


817
01:04:01.992 --> 01:04:05.596
You'll be busted, disgusted
and won't be trusted.


818
01:04:09.332 --> 01:04:11.334
You sure you're
in the right place?


819
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:17.272
Been a long day for me too,

820
01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:22.277
shit, a long year.

821
01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.179
Hopefully they fixed the
bunk problem in this place,


822
01:04:27.181 --> 01:04:29.816
since I been here last,

823
01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:31.049
I been walking around

824
01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:34.587
looking like I have the
measles all week, see.


825
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:36.656
Alright, ladies, it's getting
late and I wanna go to bed.


826
01:04:36.658 --> 01:04:39.323
You're too pretty
to be in this place anyway.


827
01:04:39.325 --> 01:04:41.359
How'd you end up here?

828
01:04:41.361 --> 01:04:43.361
Don't you have a
man or something?


829
01:04:43.363 --> 01:04:44.730
I'm not here to make friends

830
01:04:44.732 --> 01:04:46.865
and if I had one fuck to give,
it wouldn't be for a man.


831
01:04:46.867 --> 01:04:51.101
- I hear that, amen to that.
- Ladies, I won't ask again.


832
01:04:51.103 --> 01:04:52.772
- Hi, Cornel.
- Search this one.


833
01:04:55.507 --> 01:04:57.541
Don't you touch me.

834
01:04:57.543 --> 01:04:58.676
Ma'am, calm down.

835
01:04:58.678 --> 01:04:59.877
- Help!
- I'm just doing my job!


836
01:04:59.879 --> 01:05:01.913
- Assault!
- You know the rules.


837
01:05:01.915 --> 01:05:03.580
- Police brutality!
- Come on,


838
01:05:03.582 --> 01:05:05.849
don't make me hurt you,
come on now, come on.


839
01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:07.116
- No!
- It'll be alright.


840
01:05:07.118 --> 01:05:08.350
- Police brutality.
- It'll be okay.


841
01:05:08.352 --> 01:05:10.319
He's hurting
me, he's hurting me,


842
01:05:10.321 --> 01:05:11.922
- this man has no mercy.
- Alright.


843
01:05:11.924 --> 01:05:14.524
- Help!
- No problem, real good.


844
01:05:15.492 --> 01:05:16.359
Next.

845
01:05:20.932 --> 01:05:23.366

- No, I don't have any ID,


849
01:05:32.876 --> 01:05:35.944
I don't have a driver's license,
I don't have a state ID,


850
01:05:35.946 --> 01:05:38.848
I don't even have a passport,

No pay stub?

852
01:05:42.083 --> 01:05:43.717
No, no, I don't
have any of that.


853
01:05:43.719 --> 01:05:45.953
Look, I was here earlier,
I talked to Dr. Laura


854
01:05:45.955 --> 01:05:48.589
and she said if I wanted a
bed, I should come back here,


855
01:05:48.591 --> 01:05:50.255
so I came back.

01:05:50.257 --> 01:05:51.325
Yeah, Dr. Laura.
