2
00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:15.312
Ahoy!
Alright, Bob?


3
00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.942
Hey!

4
00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:21.193
Quick piss and a stretch,
alright?


5
00:02:21.277 --> 00:02:22.862
We're already late.
Bob.


6
00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:24.280
Dave! Thanks for doing this, bud.
Good to see you, bud.


7
00:02:24.362 --> 00:02:25.238
And you, mate.

8
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:26.782
- It's Viktor.
- Ah, Viktor.


9
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.534
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.


10
00:02:29.743 --> 00:02:30.911
This is Jim.

11
00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:36.250
So this the A Team,
eh, Bob?


12
00:02:37.084 --> 00:02:38.544
Your nephew
who's never worked,


13
00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:41.422
a Cossack and a fucking
pensioner, huh?


14
00:02:42.256 --> 00:02:43.799
Cossack?

15
00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.802
Calm down.
I'm just kidding, alright?


16
00:02:47.553 --> 00:02:49.972
That's your joke?
I'm Russian to you?


17
00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:51.098
I'm Ukrainian.

18
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:52.683
You're all the same to me.

19
00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:56.061
Okay, thank you, ladies.

20
00:02:56.145 --> 00:02:57.396
Right, if you want three months
work, jump in the van.


21
00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.564
If you don't then stay here
and have a chat.


22
00:02:58.647 --> 00:02:59.732
Alright?
In we go.


23
00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:01.400
Off we fuck then, boys.

24
00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:04.528
Siding with the immigrant, eh?

25
00:03:04.612 --> 00:03:08.199
You're all fucking immigrants
around here, bud.


26
00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:10.409
Oi!
Stop pissing on the flowers!


27
00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:22.087
<i>Who said,
If you live amongst wolves,</i>


28
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:24.715
<i>you must act like a wolf.</i>

29
00:03:24.798 --> 00:03:26.884
<i>Was it A) Ernest Hemingway...</i>

30
00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:28.677
Haven't seen like a building
or nothing in like,


31
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:30.012
twenty minutes.

32
00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:32.640
It's like being in bloody
Africa or something.


33
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:35.267
Yeah, we got all sorts
going on down here now.


34
00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:38.604
Electricity, poppety pings.

35
00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:41.774
Go down, Cardiff Bay
after a skinfull.


36
00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:45.569
Squint.
Could be Sydney, bud. Huh?


37
00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:47.696
<i>Smell that fresh air,
Stevie boy!</i>


38
00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:08.676
Once your inheritance clears,
everything's golden, Simon.


39
00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.844
But I'm afraid until then
your financial situation


40
00:04:10.928 --> 00:04:13.472
is rather more Milton Keynes
than Monaco.


41
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.269
Building work's a money pit.
It's notorious for it.


42
00:04:19.353 --> 00:04:20.896
Not on the terms
I've got this guy.


43
00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:26.694
You'll inherit this fucking
pile of rocks by Christmas.


44
00:04:26.777 --> 00:04:29.280
Just sit tight
and enjoy the views.


45
00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:33.283
It's exactly what my family
would expect of me.


46
00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:36.620
<i>Simon!
Have you seen my keys?</i>


47
00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:38.956
No, darling.
Have you tried the kitchen?


48
00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.917
Ouch! Fuck!

49
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:43.127
Sorry about that.

50
00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:47.965
Look, you employ me
to give you advice.


51
00:04:48.048 --> 00:04:49.967
If you're not going to listen,
then I might as well go.


52
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.721
But you need to know,
there's been rumors...


53
00:04:53.804 --> 00:04:55.723
I mean, the city
runs on them but um,


54
00:04:55.806 --> 00:04:57.683
about further clamp downs.

55
00:04:57.766 --> 00:04:59.810
The inheritance trust,
the Caymans,


56
00:04:59.894 --> 00:05:01.228
but every penny is in there.

57
00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:02.730
You said that was legitimate.

58
00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:05.524
Now did you avoid that
or evade it?


59
00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:06.734
Look, one's a criminal offense,

60
00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:09.486
the other earns a gold star
in ingenuity.


61
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.907
Inheritance tax
isn't meant to be optional.


62
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.658
Just once I wish
you'd bring me good news.


63
00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:19.914
Oh!

64
00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:23.500
There's an alarming amount
of testosterone in here.


65
00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.462
Erm, I thought we were off
to the wild's.


66
00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:28.505
Sorry, the builders are late.

67
00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:30.966
Great.

68
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.093
Darling, I've just been told
this whole renovation thing's


69
00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:34.845
a bad idea.

70
00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:36.472
What do you think?

71
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:42.728
Well, um, what's he called?
Is it Robert?


72
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:43.854
- Richard.
- Richard.


73
00:05:43.938 --> 00:05:45.105
Richard.

74
00:05:46.065 --> 00:05:48.859
Personally, I...
I think it's fine how it is,


75
00:05:48.943 --> 00:05:53.113
but I think you'll find if this
one has an idea in his head,


76
00:05:53.197 --> 00:05:55.866
he, er, he's very hard
to dissuade.


77
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.451
It was just advice.

78
00:05:57.535 --> 00:05:58.994
Right.
I'll be heading off.


79
00:05:59.078 --> 00:06:00.871
Simon, don't worry about that
thing we were talking about.


80
00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:03.999
I'll keep my ears to the ground
and make contingency.


81
00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:09.463
I suppose I'd better
unpack then?


82
00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:11.674
Okay.

83
00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:29.984
Oh my God, man.
What a shit hole!


84
00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:31.777
You never been to Rhyll,
then?


85
00:06:34.655 --> 00:06:39.577
Well, it's only for a couple
of weeks, lads.


86
00:06:40.703 --> 00:06:43.205
Once we've got the barn fitted
up, we'll camp in there, yeah?


87
00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:46.166
Breathe it in, lads, that's as
sweet as she's gonna smell.


88
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.043
The five of is in here, eh?

89
00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:49.670
Fucking hell.

90
00:06:49.753 --> 00:06:51.714
This is fucking luxury.

91
00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:53.132
I've got shit
in some plastic box


92
00:06:53.215 --> 00:06:55.634
like some student
at Glastonbury.


93
00:06:56.886 --> 00:06:59.680
It stinks in here, Bob.
It smells like someone died.


94
00:06:59.763 --> 00:07:00.848
Yeah, well do us a favor,

95
00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:02.349
shift your stuff,
you're on the top.


96
00:07:02.433 --> 00:07:03.309
Shut it.

97
00:07:25.623 --> 00:07:27.124
Okay, so!

98
00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:29.126
Hay barn to be renovated.

99
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.170
Restoration to that barn there.

100
00:07:31.253 --> 00:07:33.214
And the outbuilding conversion.

101
00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:36.508
Now, let's just get the
parameters crystal clear.


102
00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:37.885
Shall we?

103
00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:41.430
Three months, or completion
penalties will kick in.


104
00:07:41.513 --> 00:07:43.933
Let's just bring her in on time
and on budget, yes?


105
00:07:44.016 --> 00:07:45.559
Absolutely lads, yeah?

106
00:07:47.978 --> 00:07:49.480
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.


107
00:07:49.563 --> 00:07:52.233
- Ooh!
- Are you alright?


108
00:07:52.316 --> 00:07:53.776
No worries.

109
00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:59.740
Er, hiya, gents!

110
00:07:59.823 --> 00:08:01.408
- Hi.
- Hey.


111
00:08:01.867 --> 00:08:03.827
I was gonna come
and bring you all cups of tea


112
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:06.789
but I kinda had a hunch
you'd expect it from then on...


113
00:08:06.872 --> 00:08:09.375
So I've left a box of tea
in the kitchen for you.


114
00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:10.709
Sounds good.

115
00:08:11.252 --> 00:08:13.254
And there's plenty of sugar
in there, too.


116
00:08:13.337 --> 00:08:14.964
Oh, sorry,
I'm Amy by the way!


117
00:08:15.047 --> 00:08:17.591
- Okay so, intros done, yeah?
- Yes.


118
00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:20.344
Can we just get
one thing clear?


119
00:08:21.512 --> 00:08:24.223
Down here is the
construction site.


120
00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:27.851
Up there is our home,
and it's off limits.


121
00:08:28.978 --> 00:08:30.187
You understand?

122
00:08:30.271 --> 00:08:31.272
Yeah, oh, on that.

123
00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:33.357
Look, the mobile signals
a bit in and out


124
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.526
and it's a two hour round trip
to the supplier,


125
00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:38.237
so I was just wondering
if I could use the landline?


126
00:08:40.322 --> 00:08:43.325
I'll run an extension cable
by the porch, how's that?


127
00:08:45.744 --> 00:08:47.079
That's fine, yeah.

128
00:08:47.663 --> 00:08:49.289
Okay.
Alright, come on, let's go.


129
00:08:49.789 --> 00:08:50.791
Shall we?

130
00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:52.042
Yeah.

131
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.007
- Seem alright?
- Yeah.


132
00:09:25.451 --> 00:09:27.036
<i>Hey? Hello?</i>

133
00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:29.121
<i>Are you there?</i>

134
00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:30.581
<i>Hi, it's Jim.</i>

135
00:09:30.664 --> 00:09:31.957
<i>Jim!</i>

136
00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:34.001
You don't need to know
where I am, okay?


137
00:09:34.084 --> 00:09:36.003
I'm lying low,
keeping my head down.


138
00:09:37.504 --> 00:09:39.924
The Hounslow job.
The warehouse.


139
00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:46.096
When I turned around, there was
this fucking security guard


140
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.723
running at me, okay?

141
00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:50.809
It was FUBAR.

142
00:09:52.144 --> 00:09:54.146
Fucking Google it!

143
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.398
Look, I just lost it, okay?

144
00:09:56.982 --> 00:09:58.192
He was a mess.

145
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:00.402
I need a passport.

146
00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:03.447
Hey.
Are you there?


147
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.006
Okay.

148
00:10:22.841 --> 00:10:24.218
- Ooh.
- Here you go, sir.


149
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:25.844
Cheers, thank you.

150
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.896
You know, when I was your age,
we had all hills like this,


151
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.816
black as tar from the works.

152
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:44.196
Trees, bushes, everything,
coated in shit!


153
00:10:47.408 --> 00:10:48.993
Everyone had a cough

154
00:10:49.076 --> 00:10:52.955
but everyone had work.

155
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.502
I always wanted to travel

156
00:10:58.586 --> 00:11:02.298
but it just never
seemed to happen.


157
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:05.885
I've only left
the valleys twice.


158
00:11:07.928 --> 00:11:11.140
It's been three years for me
away from home.


159
00:11:11.223 --> 00:11:12.766
This my last job.

160
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.351
Last one?

161
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:17.104
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


162
00:11:17.187 --> 00:11:18.147
- What's happening, boys?
- This is the life, hey?


163
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.940
Oh, that smells well nice.

164
00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:22.526
You're a lot good at cooking,
ain't ya?


165
00:11:23.527 --> 00:11:25.279
I still can't get this bloody
Wi-Fi, Bob.


166
00:11:26.739 --> 00:11:27.865
Yeah, we're on a rock

167
00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:29.491
in the middle of sheep country,
Steve, yeah?


168
00:11:29.575 --> 00:11:30.826
- Just leave that for a bit, mate.
- Don't be an idiot, mate,


169
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.286
you can get Wi-Fi, everywhere,
Bob.


170
00:11:32.369 --> 00:11:33.913
Do you know that?
It's everywhere.


171
00:11:34.872 --> 00:11:36.498
What's with my fucking phone,
man?


172
00:11:36.582 --> 00:11:38.167
It's a joke!

173
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.710
How's there no Wi
-Fi here?

174
00:11:39.793 --> 00:11:42.087
We're here for three months,
Bob!


175
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:44.048
What we gonna do,
there's no Facebook?


176
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:45.799
No Netflix?

177
00:11:45.883 --> 00:11:48.052
For three months, man.

178
00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:50.804
What are you lot laughing for?

179
00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:52.097
What we gonna do?
There's no porn!


180
00:11:53.974 --> 00:11:56.393
For three months man,
fucking hell, man.


181
00:11:56.477 --> 00:11:58.812
That's human rights
to have Wi-Fi.


182
00:12:00.356 --> 00:12:01.982
What you laughing for?
I've got needs, man.


183
00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:04.193
That's fucking abuse!

184
00:12:04.818 --> 00:12:06.111
- For fuck's sake.
- Listen.


185
00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:08.614
- What?
- Stop complaining, alright?


186
00:12:08.697 --> 00:12:10.032
You could be somewhere
a lot worse than this,


187
00:12:10.115 --> 00:12:12.451
you remember that, alright?
You're a lucky lad.


188
00:12:13.536 --> 00:12:15.579
Here's to a good job
being done on time, yeah?


189
00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:18.457
Yeah. Cheers.

190
00:12:19.124 --> 00:12:21.835
Three months?
Fucking good luck with that.


191
00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:22.753
Yeah well,
you heard what he said,


192
00:12:22.836 --> 00:12:24.338
we've got no choice, yeah?

193
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.677
- Who's in?
- Yep.


194
00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:39.812
Deal the foreigner out?

195
00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:41.480
Well done, big boy.

196
00:12:41.564 --> 00:12:43.899
Is it because I have
different passport?


197
00:12:45.192 --> 00:12:48.028
It's not like getting a passport
is hard thing.


198
00:12:49.655 --> 00:12:51.073
Or is it?

199
00:12:52.116 --> 00:12:52.992
I'm done.

200
00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:55.244
Hey, Vik!

201
00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:46.962
Right!

202
00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:48.464
Change of plan.

203
00:13:48.547 --> 00:13:50.341
The hay barn...
flatten it.


204
00:13:51.258 --> 00:13:53.219
Aye, we're on a break, okay?

205
00:13:54.094 --> 00:13:55.804
What the hell's
going on in here?


206
00:13:55.888 --> 00:13:57.598
Get back to work!
Now!


207
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.312
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?


208
00:14:03.812 --> 00:14:05.397
You're not in the army anymore.

209
00:14:09.193 --> 00:14:10.569
This is my land.

210
00:14:11.153 --> 00:14:13.822
Show me some fucking respect!

211
00:14:15.074 --> 00:14:16.992
Or you are off this job.

212
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.954
All of you.

213
00:14:40.599 --> 00:14:41.517
Ooh!

214
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.143
High stakes tonight, lads.

215
00:14:43.227 --> 00:14:45.479
What kind of bloody hand
is that?


216
00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:50.651
Shit cards!

217
00:14:52.361 --> 00:14:54.446
Mugs game we ain't got
any money anyway.


218
00:14:55.114 --> 00:14:56.699
Ah, bollocks.

219
00:14:56.782 --> 00:14:57.992
Whoa!
Look lively.


220
00:14:58.075 --> 00:15:00.369
It's the captain cockspangle,
sir!


221
00:15:02.037 --> 00:15:03.747
Glass beads for savages,
yeah?


222
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:05.875
Hey, you, behave, yeah?

223
00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:08.294
Hiya!
How are you?


224
00:15:08.377 --> 00:15:09.879
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Good evening.


225
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.299
I thought we better
clear the air.


226
00:15:13.883 --> 00:15:16.552
Oh, well, that's very nice
of you, cheers!


227
00:15:16.635 --> 00:15:17.720
Nice bottle of plonk, hey?

228
00:15:17.803 --> 00:15:19.096
- Ooh.
- Here we go.


229
00:15:19.179 --> 00:15:20.681
I'll be mother.

230
00:15:21.015 --> 00:15:22.808
- Cheers, lad.
- There you go.


231
00:15:23.517 --> 00:15:25.311
- Alright.
- Cheers, Bob.


232
00:15:25.686 --> 00:15:27.521
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Mother. Cheers.


233
00:15:27.605 --> 00:15:28.856
Nice drop there.

234
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:31.525
- Mm-hmm.
- That's cracking that.


235
00:15:31.609 --> 00:15:34.361
Show it some respect.
It's a '98 Chateau Fonsalette.


236
00:15:34.445 --> 00:15:36.280
You're supposed
to let her breathe.


237
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.078
So um,
so what are we playing?


238
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.924
Right, look.

239
00:15:56.258 --> 00:15:59.803
Maybe I, maybe I lost my cool
a little earlier,


240
00:15:59.887 --> 00:16:02.848
but this is my house,
these are my rules.


241
00:16:04.266 --> 00:16:07.603
and if I was a bit abrupt,
well then that's just me.


242
00:16:08.812 --> 00:16:10.147
You'll get used to it.

243
00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:11.899
It's alright.

244
00:16:11.982 --> 00:16:13.734
We understand, yeah?

245
00:16:13.817 --> 00:16:15.569
How much you pay
for this wine?


246
00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:18.739
I don't know.

247
00:16:18.822 --> 00:16:20.491
She's been in the cellar
for years.


248
00:16:20.574 --> 00:16:23.244
I imagine she'd retail at
something like ninety...


249
00:16:23.327 --> 00:16:25.162
...ninety-five today.

250
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.790
Here's to sitting on
the top of the mountains


251
00:16:27.873 --> 00:16:29.625
and drinking 100 Euro wine!

252
00:16:29.708 --> 00:16:31.168
Cheers, bud!

253
00:16:31.252 --> 00:16:32.753
It is good.

254
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.341
So are we playing or what,
gentlemen?


255
00:16:39.134 --> 00:16:40.928
You have to sling in the keys
to that Merc outside,


256
00:16:41.011 --> 00:16:42.721
if you want dealing in.

257
00:16:44.098 --> 00:16:47.768
Well it's a quid small blind,
two quid big blind so...


258
00:16:47.851 --> 00:16:49.812
I think I can stretch to that.

259
00:16:56.402 --> 00:16:57.987
So you're army then, yeah?

260
00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.321
I was.

261
00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:01.782
You ever kill anyone?

262
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:05.369
Not today.

263
00:17:07.037 --> 00:17:09.331
My sister's boy was army.

264
00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:11.125
- Welsh Guards?
- Yeah.


265
00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:12.960
Yeah, they're good men.

266
00:17:13.043 --> 00:17:14.545
Walking down the street
in Helmand,


267
00:17:14.628 --> 00:17:17.172
with a squaddy
from Ebbw Vale.


268
00:17:18.507 --> 00:17:19.842
Head blown clean off.

269
00:17:22.136 --> 00:17:23.344
What?

270
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:24.638
Well better that than some
of them coming home


271
00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:26.515
with bits missing,
fucked in the head,


272
00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:27.850
you know what I mean?

273
00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:29.810
He's a right buzz killer,
this one, ain't he?


274
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:32.478
I'm fucking warning you,

275
00:17:32.563 --> 00:17:33.814
you fucking start on me again,
I'll have you hear me?


276
00:17:33.898 --> 00:17:35.149
Whoa! Hey!

277
00:17:35.232 --> 00:17:36.065
Fold.

278
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:40.779
So, the army...

279
00:17:41.822 --> 00:17:43.574
Jumped or pushed?

280
00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:45.201
You know what,
I'll have a slice.


281
00:17:45.284 --> 00:17:48.078
I see your two
and I raise you five.


282
00:17:48.162 --> 00:17:49.538
Fold.

283
00:17:49.622 --> 00:17:51.248
Sack of shit.

284
00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:55.252
I see you and I raise 10.

285
00:17:57.338 --> 00:18:00.549
Oh, that's another fiver.

286
00:18:00.633 --> 00:18:01.592
What?

287
00:18:02.718 --> 00:18:04.261
What?

288
00:18:06.472 --> 00:18:08.641
Oh, fucking hell.
Fold.


289
00:18:10.726 --> 00:18:13.103
Just you and I with the
stomach for a fight then?


290
00:18:14.355 --> 00:18:15.898
It's Viktor, isn't it?

291
00:18:15.981 --> 00:18:18.067
Show us more cards.

292
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:24.698
So, what brings you down here,
Captain?


293
00:18:24.782 --> 00:18:26.742
You're a long way south
of the border.


294
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:29.370
I might ask you
the same thing.


295
00:18:32.665 --> 00:18:36.085
No, my great-great-grandfather
won her from General Evans,


296
00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:37.378
Boer war.

297
00:18:37.461 --> 00:18:39.547
He too was something
of a poker player.


298
00:18:43.342 --> 00:18:47.638
So, who's got the Queen?
Huh?


299
00:18:50.516 --> 00:18:52.309
Show me your cards.

300
00:18:53.477 --> 00:18:55.521
Well if you want to see
my cards,


301
00:18:55.604 --> 00:18:57.147
it's gonna cost you.

302
00:18:58.232 --> 00:18:59.858
One hundred.

303
00:19:02.152 --> 00:19:04.238
He ain't eve got a teener
to his name.


304
00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:07.283
Bastard.

305
00:19:12.663 --> 00:19:14.874
What the fuck you doing, Vik?

306
00:19:30.556 --> 00:19:32.474
Show me.

307
00:19:35.895 --> 00:19:37.730
Ah! Jesus Christ.

308
00:19:37.813 --> 00:19:39.440
Oh!

309
00:19:40.232 --> 00:19:42.484
Oh dear dear dear dear.

310
00:19:44.778 --> 00:19:46.780
Oh! You bastard!

311
00:19:46.864 --> 00:19:48.908
You jammy bastard!

312
00:19:50.576 --> 00:19:52.828
You fucking jammy bastard!

313
00:19:54.622 --> 00:19:57.208
- I think I should be going.
- Oh, fucking hell...


314
00:19:57.875 --> 00:19:59.126
I'll see you tomorrow.

315
00:20:00.252 --> 00:20:02.504
Goodnight Colonel.
Thank you very much!


316
00:20:16.143 --> 00:20:18.979
No mention of when our fucking
money's coming I noticed.


317
00:20:23.776 --> 00:20:25.694
How'd ya?
Fuck...


318
00:20:31.742 --> 00:20:33.452
Sorry, Miss.
Sorry


319
00:20:34.203 --> 00:20:35.454
Hey.

320
00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:37.248
I just wanted to ask you,

321
00:20:37.331 --> 00:20:40.376
can you tell me where is the
nearest post office here please?


322
00:20:41.585 --> 00:20:44.046
Er, I can post it if you like?
We are going that way.


323
00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:45.965
It's er...

324
00:20:47.091 --> 00:20:48.259
Or you're welcome
to go yourself,


325
00:20:48.342 --> 00:20:50.094
but it's an hour drive.

326
00:20:50.177 --> 00:20:53.055
No, no no no.
Please, thank you.


327
00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.102
Sending money home?

328
00:20:58.185 --> 00:21:00.020
It's for my daughter.

329
00:21:00.104 --> 00:21:03.023
Ah.
Daughter and her mother?


330
00:21:03.107 --> 00:21:06.652
That's complicated.
Thank you anyway.


331
00:21:06.735 --> 00:21:08.445
Are you goin' away?

332
00:21:09.446 --> 00:21:12.032
Just to London for work,
not for long.


333
00:21:12.116 --> 00:21:13.409
See you when you get back.

334
00:21:13.492 --> 00:21:15.452
Thank you for that,
I really appreciate it.


335
00:21:15.536 --> 00:21:17.454
Sure, no worries.

336
00:21:17.997 --> 00:21:19.874
Thanks. Bye.

337
00:21:45.441 --> 00:21:46.817
Oh.

338
00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:40.621
Yeah, it's me again.

339
00:22:40.704 --> 00:22:42.790
Sorry about all the messages,
it's just...


340
00:22:42.873 --> 00:22:44.500
I really...

341
00:22:45.084 --> 00:22:46.919
- Fuck!
- Mr. Hegarty, Simon. Hi.


342
00:22:48.003 --> 00:22:49.129
I see the roof's not up yet.

343
00:22:49.213 --> 00:22:50.506
Yeah, I need to talk to you
about that.


344
00:22:50.589 --> 00:22:51.757
I can't talk now.

345
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.551
Well It's just that the money
to cash flow,


346
00:22:53.634 --> 00:22:55.010
the materials,
you know, pay my men.


347
00:22:55.094 --> 00:22:56.262
It's 3 weeks overdue now.

348
00:22:56.345 --> 00:22:58.806
I appreciate that,
but like I said,


349
00:22:58.889 --> 00:23:00.724
it's all tied up in stocks.

350
00:23:00.808 --> 00:23:02.768
You know what
accountants are like.


351
00:23:06.897 --> 00:23:08.190
Bob.

352
00:23:09.441 --> 00:23:10.818
I'm off to the yard.

353
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:12.778
Did he say when
the money is here?


354
00:23:12.862 --> 00:23:15.155
Don't worry about that.
That's all under control, okay?


355
00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:16.782
Go into town,
get some provisions for tonight.


356
00:23:16.866 --> 00:23:19.326
Something nice, yeah?
A bit of a morale boost.


357
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.287
And some bleach to get that shit
off the wall, yeah?


358
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.414
And be quick, yeah?
I need you back here.

361
00:23:55.237 --> 00:23:58.574
Ugh! Bloody cricket!

362
00:23:58.657 --> 00:24:01.202
Wandering around a field
in your pajamas!


363
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.828
Tea time and tourists

364
00:24:02.912 --> 00:24:05.164
and stopping for bloody
cucumber sandwiches.


365
00:24:05.247 --> 00:24:07.082
It's hardly a sport,
really is it?


366
00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:08.626
There we are,
that's better.

Fuck off, man.

373
00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:22.014
Me and Jim were listening
to the sport on that.


374
00:24:22.514 --> 00:24:23.724
Come on,
me and Jim were listening


375
00:24:23.807 --> 00:24:25.851
to the Millwall game on that.
Weren't we, Jim?


376
00:24:25.935 --> 00:24:28.604
What was the score then,
sir wank-a-lot? Huh?


377
00:24:28.687 --> 00:24:30.022
It's just a bit of static, man.

378
00:24:30.105 --> 00:24:31.815
- Keep talking, old man.
- Hey, here, I'll tell what,


379
00:24:31.899 --> 00:24:33.234
the Archers are on next.

380
00:24:33.317 --> 00:24:35.361
- You like the Archers, don't you?
- Keep talking.


381
00:24:35.444 --> 00:24:36.737
You told me that you love
listening to The Archers!


382
00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.780
Keep talking all the time!

383
00:24:37.863 --> 00:24:38.948
Yeah, you do!

384
00:24:43.244 --> 00:24:45.955
- Oi! What the hell's going on?
- Shut up, you midget!


385
00:24:46.038 --> 00:24:47.915
That's more than
a fucking style, isn't it,


386
00:24:47.998 --> 00:24:49.166
you little prick?!

387
00:24:50.251 --> 00:24:51.585
- Oi! Dave!
- Bloody asshole of a boy.


388
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:52.795
- You! Get in here!
- Shut up.


389
00:24:52.878 --> 00:24:54.213
Get in here!

390
00:24:55.673 --> 00:24:57.049
I don't know why Bob
bothered bringing


391
00:24:57.132 --> 00:24:59.176
the fucking prick
down here anyway.


392
00:26:08.954 --> 00:26:10.247
Hey.

393
00:26:11.415 --> 00:26:13.792
Hey, I was just...

394
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:17.796
It's all good,
I saw the van.


395
00:26:19.173 --> 00:26:20.549
Yeah.

396
00:26:24.678 --> 00:26:26.388
It's beautiful here, right?

397
00:26:27.514 --> 00:26:28.974
Yeah.

398
00:26:30.976 --> 00:26:33.270
Every time I go to the yard,
I stop here,


399
00:26:34.355 --> 00:26:36.190
it reminds me of home.

400
00:27:31.036 --> 00:27:33.455
Do you want a ride
back home in van?


401
00:27:33.539 --> 00:27:35.124
No, I'm good.
I'll um...


402
00:27:35.207 --> 00:27:36.917
I'll see you later.

403
00:27:39.295 --> 00:27:41.046
See you back home.

404
00:27:51.432 --> 00:27:52.850
Come on, Dave,
what can I say?


405
00:27:52.933 --> 00:27:54.768
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

406
00:27:54.852 --> 00:27:57.521
The damp in this place
is playing hell with my joints.


407
00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:58.981
What is going on?

408
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.275
Captain Cockspangle
has gone back on us


409
00:28:01.358 --> 00:28:02.902
moving into the barn.

410
00:28:03.861 --> 00:28:04.987
Yep.

411
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.530
He said now that he's not
going to London.


412
00:28:06.614 --> 00:28:08.574
Things would be a bit too cozy
between the barn and the house.


413
00:28:08.657 --> 00:28:10.284
Five of use in here
another fucking month,


414
00:28:10.367 --> 00:28:12.411
this little box.
You mad?


415
00:28:12.494 --> 00:28:14.914
- He's making a mug of you, Bob!
- Yeah, any day now, right.


416
00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:16.415
Any day, I promise.
Alright.


417
00:28:16.498 --> 00:28:18.459
Look, he's liquidizing
some assets or something!


418
00:28:18.542 --> 00:28:19.877
You said that last week.

419
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.837
Pack your bags, Vik,
we're off.


420
00:28:21.921 --> 00:28:24.840
I cannot do that,
I have to send money home.


421
00:28:24.924 --> 00:28:27.760
Look, what're you gonna
spend it on up here?


422
00:28:27.843 --> 00:28:30.095
Come on, what does it matter
when you're gonna get it?


423
00:28:30.179 --> 00:28:32.056
As long as you're
gonna get it!


424
00:28:33.182 --> 00:28:34.183
He's right.

425
00:28:35.392 --> 00:28:37.770
You guarantee
the money Tuesday?


426
00:28:40.356 --> 00:28:41.982
I say we stay.

427
00:28:43.025 --> 00:28:45.319
Tuesday, yeah?

428
00:28:45.402 --> 00:28:49.156
I promise you big thick
wedges of cash on Tuesday.


429
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.491
Yeah? Dave?

430
00:28:50.574 --> 00:28:52.451
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday.


431
00:28:54.245 --> 00:28:57.414
Okay, Tuesday.

432
00:29:04.046 --> 00:29:06.799
So the blonde one appears
incapable of going


433
00:29:06.882 --> 00:29:09.343
more than two minutes
without spitting.


434
00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:12.221
I can barely understand
the Eastern European one.


435
00:29:12.304 --> 00:29:14.306
You know the stocky one?
the Scot?


436
00:29:15.516 --> 00:29:17.393
There's just something about him
I don't like.


437
00:29:19.645 --> 00:29:21.313
How did the fundraiser go?

438
00:29:21.397 --> 00:29:22.940
Yeah, it was good actually.

439
00:29:23.023 --> 00:29:25.651
I forget, your accountant
was there, what's his name?


440
00:29:25.734 --> 00:29:27.570
- Richard.
- Richard, yes.


441
00:29:28.904 --> 00:29:30.823
Didn't really figure it to be
an accountant's thing,


442
00:29:30.906 --> 00:29:33.325
but he asked me
to tell you to call him.


443
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:36.078
He said it was urgent,
something about tax


444
00:29:36.161 --> 00:29:38.330
or a shelter or something.

445
00:29:39.164 --> 00:29:40.583
Sorry, I wan't really listening,

446
00:29:40.666 --> 00:29:43.127
there were some city boys
outside starting a food fight.


447
00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:45.963
No, it's fine.
I'll call him.


448
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.316
Hi, Pete?

449
00:30:05.399 --> 00:30:07.568
Hello Pete, it's Bob.
Yeah, Bob Pearson.


450
00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:10.237
Yeah, I'm sorry
it's so late, mate.


451
00:30:10.321 --> 00:30:13.532
Um, listen, just quickly,
I've got a bloke with me


452
00:30:13.616 --> 00:30:15.951
who says he's grafted
with you before. Yeah.


453
00:30:16.035 --> 00:30:17.995
Jim.

454
00:30:18.078 --> 00:30:20.122
Jim Ainsworth?

455
00:30:25.002 --> 00:30:26.837
Yeah.

456
00:30:55.032 --> 00:30:56.200
Hey, Jim.
Jim, have a look.


457
00:30:56.283 --> 00:30:57.826
Have a look, 12 o'clock.

458
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.913
That's a bit crumpet, mate.
Ooh!


459
00:31:00.996 --> 00:31:03.457
About time we had a bit of
entertainment around here.


460
00:31:05.292 --> 00:31:06.627
Go, Captain!

461
00:31:09.088 --> 00:31:10.839
Come on, guys.
That's not okay.


462
00:31:10.923 --> 00:31:12.675
We shouldn't watch it,
let's go inside.


463
00:31:12.758 --> 00:31:14.760
What, you jealous,
are you, Viktor?


464
00:31:15.594 --> 00:31:17.805
- What did you said?
- Huh?


465
00:31:17.888 --> 00:31:19.223
What did you said?

466
00:31:19.306 --> 00:31:20.766
I said are you jealous?

467
00:31:20.849 --> 00:31:21.892
Listen, stop taking the piss,

468
00:31:21.976 --> 00:31:23.143
I'm gonna slap you
like a little bitch.


469
00:31:23.227 --> 00:31:25.354
Yeah? Yeah?

470
00:31:25.437 --> 00:31:27.690
Keep touching me.
Look, what you touching me for?


471
00:31:27.773 --> 00:31:29.108
What did you just say?

472
00:31:29.858 --> 00:31:30.693
What did you say,
I couldn't hear ya.


473
00:31:30.776 --> 00:31:32.278
What'd ya say?

474
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.321
Go inside
when I say you to go.


475
00:31:34.405 --> 00:31:36.240
Hey!
What's going on?


476
00:31:37.491 --> 00:31:38.367
Oh, okay.

477
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.535
Come on,
have a little watch.


478
00:31:39.618 --> 00:31:41.161
Alright.

479
00:31:41.245 --> 00:31:43.747
Alright, show's over.
Inside. Inside!


480
00:31:43.831 --> 00:31:44.665
Hey!

481
00:31:46.041 --> 00:31:47.751
Get inside or I'll send you
back to your parents.


482
00:31:47.835 --> 00:31:49.712
You can deal
with that shit yourself.


483
00:31:49.795 --> 00:31:51.422
Get in.

484
00:31:52.506 --> 00:31:54.258
Touch me again,
you little prick.


485
00:31:54.884 --> 00:31:57.720
Okay, listen, Jim.

486
00:31:59.597 --> 00:32:02.892
I don't think this country larks
up your street, is it really?


487
00:32:02.975 --> 00:32:05.227
So, I think it's best
that just the four of us


488
00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:07.146
finish this, alright?

489
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.523
Who have you been speaking to?

490
00:32:10.649 --> 00:32:12.318
No one.

491
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:14.153
I'm the boss here, okay?

492
00:32:14.236 --> 00:32:16.530
I don't like the way you're
rubbing off on my nephew.


493
00:32:17.448 --> 00:32:19.241
Brian Gartside,

494
00:32:19.325 --> 00:32:22.494
Pete Ranger or the Russian?

495
00:32:25.414 --> 00:32:27.124
No.

496
00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:29.668
I just think
it's best that you go.


497
00:32:31.754 --> 00:32:33.589
When you sack a man, Bob,

498
00:32:33.672 --> 00:32:35.633
it's customary to pay him
what you owe.


499
00:32:35.716 --> 00:32:38.219
You can't do that,
can you?


500
00:32:39.511 --> 00:32:42.598
And your letting
Captain Dickface up there


501
00:32:42.681 --> 00:32:45.851
run over the top of you,
it's fucking pathetic.


502
00:32:45.935 --> 00:32:48.270
You need more men on this job,
not fewer.


503
00:32:48.354 --> 00:32:50.397
If you're gonna
bring it in on time,


504
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:52.358
avoid penalties.

505
00:32:53.943 --> 00:32:55.236
Alright.

506
00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:59.156
I'm gonna pay you,
and I want you gone.


507
00:33:04.703 --> 00:33:07.706
Just remember,
if the police come round here,


508
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.585
all they're gonna find
is cash in hand tax fraud


509
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:14.713
and an illegal fucking
immigrant.


510
00:33:34.692 --> 00:33:35.651
Richard?

511
00:33:35.734 --> 00:33:37.486
The builders
are getting restless.


512
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.530
Do you have any news
on the inheritance?


513
00:33:40.197 --> 00:33:41.615
That's the least
of your worries.


514
00:33:41.699 --> 00:33:45.703
Simon, I had a call.

515
00:33:46.453 --> 00:33:47.663
The Caymans.

516
00:33:47.746 --> 00:33:49.415
<i>The inheritance trust?</i>

517
00:33:49.999 --> 00:33:52.710
Christ, Richard,
you said this was legitimate.


518
00:33:52.793 --> 00:33:54.587
It seems the FCA's
interpretation of


519
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.964
"Essence of the Law"
now differs from ours.


520
00:33:57.047 --> 00:33:58.632
<i>They're closing the scheme
down Thursday.</i>


521
00:33:58.716 --> 00:34:01.385
Warrants, dawn raids,
the whole shebang.


522
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.347
<i>Oh! Okay.
Worse case?</i>


523
00:34:06.181 --> 00:34:07.683
<i>They consider it evasion.</i>

524
00:34:07.766 --> 00:34:09.351
<i>You get hit at everything
that's in there,</i>


525
00:34:09.435 --> 00:34:10.895
<i>plus the family house
in Wales.</i>


526
00:34:10.978 --> 00:34:13.397
<i>What? Lose the family home
and the Hegarty fortune</i>


527
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.649
<i>to the fucking tax man?</i>

528
00:34:15.733 --> 00:34:16.901
<i>This is an inside tip off.</i>

529
00:34:16.984 --> 00:34:18.903
<i>We have a small window
of opportunity.</i>


530
00:34:18.986 --> 00:34:20.779
<i>The raids don't happen
until Thursday.</i>


531
00:34:20.863 --> 00:34:22.239
So?

532
00:34:22.323 --> 00:34:24.490
<i>I told you I'd been making
contingency plans.</i>


533
00:34:24.575 --> 00:34:26.410
<i>That's why you pay me, Simon.</i>

534
00:34:28.037 --> 00:34:29.914
<i>I've set up a holding company,
a shell.</i>


535
00:34:29.997 --> 00:34:31.664
<i>You get some sun
on your face...</i>


536
00:34:31.749 --> 00:34:33.959
<i>You pull the money out in cash,
walk across the street,</i>


537
00:34:34.043 --> 00:34:36.295
<i>stick it in the new company,
go for a dip.</i>


538
00:34:36.378 --> 00:34:38.297
<i>The tax man will knock
the door down on Monday.</i>


539
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.965
When it's empty.

540
00:34:40.382 --> 00:34:42.718
Oh, you will need a signatory.

541
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.720
<i>I'll have Amy get her passport
from London.</i>


542
00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:51.352
Bloody freezing,
no fucking money!


543
00:34:51.434 --> 00:34:52.853
Fucking hell!

544
00:35:18.087 --> 00:35:19.338
Shit!

545
00:35:32.184 --> 00:35:33.602
<i>Ooh!</i>

546
00:35:33.686 --> 00:35:36.355
<i>Right, come on, lads,
up and at it, rise and shine.</i>


547
00:35:36.438 --> 00:35:39.275
<i>It's Tuesday!
It's fucking pay day, boys!</i>


548
00:35:41.944 --> 00:35:43.028
All I'm saying is,

549
00:35:43.112 --> 00:35:45.781
that one day
we won't be countries,


550
00:35:45.865 --> 00:35:49.118
we'll be named after brands
and corporations.


551
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:50.119
Dave.

552
00:35:50.202 --> 00:35:51.370
You're more of a fucking
communist


553
00:35:51.453 --> 00:35:53.080
than Sputnik sometimes,
you know that?


554
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.916
Right, so you up for making
a night of it then?


555
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.210
Spend a bit of that hard earned
cash in Cardiff?


556
00:35:58.294 --> 00:36:00.087
You got people right,

557
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.424
who can sit burning bank notes
day and night,


558
00:36:03.507 --> 00:36:06.051
and still not get through them
in their lifetime.


559
00:36:06.135 --> 00:36:08.929
Now, where's the justice
in that, huh?


560
00:36:09.013 --> 00:36:10.389
Don't matter how rich you are.

561
00:36:10.472 --> 00:36:12.808
You only got one asshole,
one pair of feet,


562
00:36:12.892 --> 00:36:16.103
and we all end up in the same
sized fucking hole, right?


563
00:36:16.979 --> 00:36:18.397
Dave?

564
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.983
Any news on when Bob might be
here with our money, huh?


565
00:36:21.066 --> 00:36:22.818
Oh mate, two and a half grand
in my pocket?


566
00:36:22.902 --> 00:36:24.195
I'm getting the lot, man.

567
00:36:24.278 --> 00:36:26.864
I'm getting a hotel,
get the shots in.


568
00:36:26.947 --> 00:36:29.992
Get a nice little brass,
yeah the works!


569
00:36:33.287 --> 00:36:36.540
Hey, David,
alright, old man river?


570
00:36:37.917 --> 00:36:39.668
I don't suppose any of your pals
in the old people's home


571
00:36:39.752 --> 00:36:42.087
can get their hands on any
funky meds, can they?


572
00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:43.214
See that?

573
00:36:43.297 --> 00:36:44.924
Okay, change of plan.

574
00:36:45.007 --> 00:36:48.177
Rain's coming in so let's shift
to lining the barn, yeah?


575
00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.013
Steve said you had been
to the bank?


576
00:36:51.096 --> 00:36:53.724
Yeah. Yeah,
to pay the suppliers off.


577
00:36:53.807 --> 00:36:55.809
I'm seeing the Hegarty later on,
okay.


578
00:36:55.893 --> 00:36:56.810
You're going to get
your money tonight,


579
00:36:56.894 --> 00:36:58.479
so happy days, yeah?

580
00:36:58.562 --> 00:37:00.189
Can I have a word, Vik?

581
00:37:03.025 --> 00:37:04.401
What?

582
00:37:04.485 --> 00:37:05.694
You knew about Jim?

583
00:37:06.737 --> 00:37:08.405
I don't trust him, okay?

584
00:37:08.489 --> 00:37:10.783
I'm gonna need you later on.
I'm gonna pay him off


585
00:37:10.866 --> 00:37:13.410
and I want you to help me
get him off site, alright?


586
00:37:13.494 --> 00:37:14.662
Help you?

587
00:37:14.745 --> 00:37:17.790
I hear Steve has been
working half as hard.


588
00:37:17.873 --> 00:37:19.250
Getting paid twice
as much as me.


589
00:37:19.333 --> 00:37:20.334
Why should I help?

590
00:37:20.417 --> 00:37:22.586
Look, I'm sorry about this,
yeah.


591
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.629
You're a good grafter.

592
00:37:23.712 --> 00:37:24.964
I'd give you more money
if I could,


593
00:37:25.047 --> 00:37:27.591
but I'm up to my neck
in debt.


594
00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:30.594
Look, I am being screwed
into the ground.


595
00:37:30.678 --> 00:37:32.930
Come on.
You took the job, yeah?


596
00:37:33.013 --> 00:37:34.348
You know if you didn't want it,

597
00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:36.141
I could have got
any one of your guys


598
00:37:36.225 --> 00:37:38.102
for the same money,
you know that, okay?


599
00:37:38.185 --> 00:37:41.355
I am sorry,
but that's just the way it is.


600
00:37:41.438 --> 00:37:43.023
I'm sorry, okay?

601
00:37:44.984 --> 00:37:46.110
Oh!

602
00:37:46.193 --> 00:37:47.695
Oh, Jesus!

603
00:37:47.778 --> 00:37:51.073
- What now?
- Oh, your idiot fucking nephew


604
00:37:51.156 --> 00:37:53.868
just dropped a fucking
sledgehammer on me, ah!


605
00:37:55.035 --> 00:37:57.580
- The fuck are you up to?
- Oh, my bastard shoulder!


606
00:37:57.663 --> 00:37:59.206
Get a grip, boy!

607
00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:04.795
Keep your hair on.
I didn't mean it. I was...


608
00:38:04.879 --> 00:38:06.547
Fuck's sake, Steve!

609
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.133
Get him out.
I'm gonna get an ambulance.


610
00:38:12.803 --> 00:38:14.054
<i>Hello?</i>

611
00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:18.017
Mr. Hegarty?

612
00:38:18.684 --> 00:38:20.477
Simon?
It's Bob.


613
00:38:21.645 --> 00:38:24.148
Line's down in the porch,
we're got an emergency here.


614
00:38:25.482 --> 00:38:26.901
Hello?

615
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:32.323
The hell are you
doing in here?


616
00:38:33.115 --> 00:38:34.617
Money.

617
00:38:35.326 --> 00:38:36.911
Not now, please.

618
00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:40.873
Don't touch anything.

619
00:38:43.334 --> 00:38:44.793
Hello?

620
00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.504
Mr. Hegarty?
It's Bob.


621
00:38:49.715 --> 00:38:51.300
Hello?

622
00:38:58.224 --> 00:39:02.728
<i>Look, I hate to ask but seeing
as all this was your idea,</i>


623
00:39:04.647 --> 00:39:06.774
<i>I don't trust them an inch.</i>

624
00:39:10.694 --> 00:39:12.363
His and hers.

625
00:39:14.865 --> 00:39:16.075
Nice touch.

626
00:39:16.158 --> 00:39:17.826
<i>Richard, I did that!</i>

627
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:19.411
<i>I hit them hard on snagging.</i>

628
00:39:19.495 --> 00:39:22.081
<i>I tried to trigger penalties
to buy us time but no!</i>

630

<i>You need to help me
string them along,</i>


631
00:39:27.253 --> 00:39:29.838
<i>just for a couple of months,
until the money is clean.</i>


632
00:39:31.006 --> 00:39:32.174
<i>Are you serious?</i>

633
00:39:32.258 --> 00:39:34.176
<i>Do you know the rate
on a bridging loan?</i>


634
00:39:36.095 --> 00:39:37.555
<i>Yeah well,
it's like you said,</i>


635
00:39:37.638 --> 00:39:40.140
Pearson's firm is on
a knife-edge so,


636
00:39:40.224 --> 00:39:41.600
we drag out arbitration

637
00:39:41.684 --> 00:39:44.353
and there's a decent chance
they go bust anyway.


638
00:39:50.234 --> 00:39:51.861
Mr. Hegarty?

639
00:39:55.155 --> 00:39:57.992
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of a private conversation.


640
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.620
What the hell do you think
you're doing?


641
00:40:01.704 --> 00:40:03.414
Get out of my house!

642
00:40:03.706 --> 00:40:06.000
You planning a holiday, eh?

643
00:40:06.083 --> 00:40:07.668
Or are you doing a bunk?

644
00:40:08.544 --> 00:40:12.131
Listen, we're not leaving
this room


645
00:40:12.214 --> 00:40:13.299
until I get that money.

646
00:40:13.382 --> 00:40:15.926
And I want that money,
I want it now.


647
00:40:16.218 --> 00:40:18.971
No, if you think you can
stroll in to a man's house


648
00:40:19.054 --> 00:40:22.766
uninvited demanding money,
then you are very much mistaken.


649
00:40:25.227 --> 00:40:27.438
That may be how things are done
from whatever hole it is


650
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:29.356
that you come from,
but not here!


651
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.524
Not here!
You!


652
00:40:30.608 --> 00:40:32.651
Okay.
Okay, so here.


653
00:40:32.735 --> 00:40:35.029
- Jesus, oh...
- Okay.


654
00:40:35.112 --> 00:40:36.697
- Need the length.
- Aye, aye, aye...


655
00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.449
Shit, Dave.

656
00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:41.911
Well that's game over, innit.

657
00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:45.789
Steve!

658
00:40:45.873 --> 00:40:47.791
Well how's he gonna graft,
he's got a broken collarbone?


659
00:40:48.459 --> 00:40:50.586
Old man can't even
pull on his boots!


660
00:40:51.837 --> 00:40:53.214
What you gonna do?

661
00:40:54.215 --> 00:40:56.842
You little fucker.

662
00:40:59.803 --> 00:41:01.096
- Take it easy!
- Get off me!


663
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.473
Easy!

664
00:41:02.556 --> 00:41:03.724
What the fuck?

665
00:41:03.807 --> 00:41:06.727
Take it easy! Take it easy!
Calm down!


666
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:07.978
Calm down and we'll let you go,
okay?


667
00:41:08.062 --> 00:41:09.605
Just calm down.

668
00:41:09.688 --> 00:41:12.274
Mr. Hegarty just calm down,
and I'll let you go, okay?


669
00:41:12.358 --> 00:41:15.819
Stay still and I can let you go,
in 3... 2... 1...


670
00:41:15.903 --> 00:41:17.655
Okay. Okay...

671
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.747
Why don't you tell the guys
how you planned to rip us off?


672
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.458
We heard him on the phone.

673
00:41:29.542 --> 00:41:31.961
Two tours Afghanistan,
One Iraq.


674
00:41:32.044 --> 00:41:34.004
Do you think I'm intimidated
by you?


675
00:41:34.088 --> 00:41:35.256
Give me my money!

676
00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:36.840
You give me what's owed
to me today, right!


677
00:41:36.924 --> 00:41:38.342
No pissing about now!

678
00:41:38.425 --> 00:41:39.802
That's just not possible.

679
00:41:39.885 --> 00:41:42.638
Bigger issues at play here.
You wouldn't understand.


680
00:41:42.721 --> 00:41:43.722
Try us.

681
00:41:45.057 --> 00:41:47.768
The only thing I'm giving you
is a cheer


682
00:41:47.851 --> 00:41:49.853
when the judge sends you back
down where you belong.


683
00:41:49.937 --> 00:41:51.814
Fuck you!
Fuck you, prick!


684
00:41:51.897 --> 00:41:53.524
Bob! Bob!
Bob, the car!


685
00:41:53.607 --> 00:41:55.317
The car must be worth what?
Sixty-seventy grand?


686
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:56.861
We'll fucking take that,
fuck him!


687
00:41:56.944 --> 00:41:58.445
She's a lease.

688
00:41:59.238 --> 00:42:02.074
- Check the glove, boys.
- Last chance, dickhead.


689
00:42:02.157 --> 00:42:03.409
Money!

690
00:42:04.535 --> 00:42:07.288
It's not possible.

691
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:09.832
What part of that do you not
fucking comprehend?


692
00:42:16.672 --> 00:42:18.257
Stop it!
Stop it!


693
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.100
Stop it, boy!
Stop it!


694
00:42:28.183 --> 00:42:30.144
Stop! Stop!

695
00:42:51.498 --> 00:42:52.917
You fucking killed him.

696
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:55.794
We all did.

697
00:42:55.878 --> 00:42:57.630
Okay, he fucking,
he tried to rip us off,


698
00:42:57.713 --> 00:42:59.965
then he attacked me, look!

699
00:43:00.049 --> 00:43:04.011
You dare fucking try to step
away from this, any of ya!


700
00:43:05.804 --> 00:43:07.223
Is the cunt dead then?

701
00:43:07.306 --> 00:43:10.226
Well he ain't doing the
fucking Macarena is he, boys?


702
00:43:28.452 --> 00:43:31.247
So what now?

703
00:43:33.249 --> 00:43:36.001
Firstly,
it was self defense.


704
00:43:36.085 --> 00:43:38.170
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Look at my eye.


705
00:43:38.254 --> 00:43:39.630
Self defense?

706
00:43:39.713 --> 00:43:41.215
- What the fuck you talking about?
- He hit me first!


707
00:43:41.298 --> 00:43:43.133
That's the reason you beat him
to death with a hammer?


708
00:43:43.217 --> 00:43:44.677
You trod on him!

709
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.595
Yeah, that's probably what
killed him, you fucking Cossack.


710
00:43:46.679 --> 00:43:48.847
- Shut the fuck up.
- Don't tell me to shut the fuck up.


711
00:43:48.931 --> 00:43:50.683
He was on the floor
and you went mad


712
00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:53.018
and that's why we are in
the situation we're in now


713
00:43:53.102 --> 00:43:54.895
because you lost control.

714
00:43:54.979 --> 00:43:56.230
Sit down.

715
00:43:56.313 --> 00:43:57.815
Sit down!

716
00:43:57.898 --> 00:43:59.650
Sit down, everybody!

717
00:43:59.733 --> 00:44:01.610
Bob. Sit.

718
00:44:06.073 --> 00:44:07.241
Dave.

719
00:44:07.324 --> 00:44:09.660
Self defense my fucking ass.

720
00:44:14.206 --> 00:44:15.457
What?

721
00:44:15.541 --> 00:44:16.917
Please.

722
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.712
I am fucking sitting.
Haven't you noticed?


723
00:44:19.795 --> 00:44:20.921
I'm fucking sitting here,
alright.


724
00:44:21.005 --> 00:44:23.257
Steve, just sit!
Sit!


725
00:44:27.887 --> 00:44:29.597
Okay, Bob.

726
00:44:30.681 --> 00:44:32.933
Okay. Since you're so fucking
polite about it.


727
00:44:33.017 --> 00:44:34.852
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, Vik.


728
00:44:37.187 --> 00:44:38.814
Fucking hell.

729
00:44:43.444 --> 00:44:44.987
So?

730
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.616
The captain was handed life
on a big silver plate.


731
00:44:48.699 --> 00:44:51.869
And he treated us like shit.

732
00:44:51.952 --> 00:44:54.205
Because that's precisely
what we were to him.


733
00:44:58.834 --> 00:45:01.253
Why ruin five lives
on account of him?


734
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.300
One hand.

735
00:45:08.469 --> 00:45:10.095
The loser takes the blame.

736
00:45:10.179 --> 00:45:12.097
Accidental manslaughter.

737
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:13.807
The rest get out of here,
fill their boots.


738
00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:15.351
The loser takes the blame?

739
00:45:15.434 --> 00:45:17.895
- And we don't look back.
- Fuck off!


740
00:45:17.978 --> 00:45:19.396
- Oh, Christ!
- No.


741
00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.940
I tried to stop you.
We...


742
00:45:21.023 --> 00:45:22.983
We tried to stop you.

743
00:45:23.067 --> 00:45:24.276
We?

744
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:28.656
We are all in this together.

745
00:45:32.451 --> 00:45:35.955
This way we each have a 4/5
chance of getting out,


746
00:45:36.038 --> 00:45:40.459
but the loser
puts his hand up,


747
00:45:40.543 --> 00:45:42.086
takes the medicine,

748
00:45:43.837 --> 00:45:45.548
no backing out.

749
00:45:50.844 --> 00:45:54.014
Yeah, alright.
I mean, 4 out of 5.


750
00:45:54.682 --> 00:45:55.933
Yeah, I'll take them odds.

751
00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:59.645
So, now you want
to deal me in, huh?


752
00:45:59.728 --> 00:46:02.731
No, I couldn't handle
prison again, boys.


753
00:46:02.815 --> 00:46:04.066
Not at my age.

754
00:46:04.149 --> 00:46:06.902
I did 4 months once for GBH
so fuck it, thanks.


755
00:46:06.986 --> 00:46:09.238
Well there's always the bed
sheets ain't there, granddad?


756
00:46:10.865 --> 00:46:12.992
It has to be all of us, Dave.

757
00:46:21.542 --> 00:46:24.086
Oh, fucking hell.
What fucking choice have I got?


758
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.214
Time for some leadership,
Bobby-boy.


759
00:46:38.642 --> 00:46:40.644
All eyes on you now,
Russian.


760
00:46:40.728 --> 00:46:43.063
You call me Russian
one more fucking time!


761
00:46:44.315 --> 00:46:46.859
My Uncle's fighting
fucking Russian in Donetsk...


762
00:46:51.447 --> 00:46:55.576
Look guys, it was self defense,
you already said it.


763
00:46:55.659 --> 00:46:57.411
I'm gonna make a call.

764
00:46:57.494 --> 00:46:58.787
What you doing?
Calling the police, are ya?


765
00:46:58.871 --> 00:47:00.956
Who's gonna believe
one person did all of that?


766
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.791
Give me the fucking phone.

767
00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:04.752
Give me the phone.

768
00:47:05.794 --> 00:47:08.505
- Grass.
- Sit.


769
00:47:12.676 --> 00:47:14.303
So, what, if you lose,
you're gonna take the blame


770
00:47:14.386 --> 00:47:15.387
for all of us?

771
00:47:15.471 --> 00:47:17.765
That's the deal, innit?
You grass.


772
00:47:17.848 --> 00:47:19.141
You won't last three minutes.

773
00:47:19.225 --> 00:47:20.601
Yeah, is that right?

774
00:47:22.394 --> 00:47:26.232
Okay, lets see what the lady's
brought us this time, shall we?


775
00:47:26.774 --> 00:47:29.109
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

776
00:47:30.945 --> 00:47:31.946
Ow!

777
00:47:32.821 --> 00:47:34.532
Pair of Kings.

778
00:47:35.449 --> 00:47:37.159
Bobby's looking at ace high.

779
00:47:37.243 --> 00:47:39.036
Looks like he's in the clear,
too.


780
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.123
Did you hear that?

781
00:47:43.207 --> 00:47:45.960
- What?
- I thought I heard something.


782
00:47:51.423 --> 00:47:53.050
Time for the Turn,
gentlemen.


783
00:47:57.054 --> 00:47:59.932
Bob's on a pair of fives,
probably home and dry.


784
00:48:03.227 --> 00:48:06.981
Steve and Viktor
are on shit and shit


785
00:48:07.064 --> 00:48:09.358
but as it stands.

786
00:48:09.441 --> 00:48:11.819
It looks Dave here
is the guilty party.


787
00:48:11.902 --> 00:48:16.365
Just take me to the river
and shut the fuck up, okay?


788
00:48:17.825 --> 00:48:20.327
Yes! Ow!

789
00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:23.664
Lady luck loves a valley boy!
Ow! Ow!


790
00:48:23.747 --> 00:48:25.124
It was down to the kicker,

791
00:48:25.207 --> 00:48:28.127
the immigrant with the hots
for the deceased's fiancĂ©.


792
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.421
I've see tougher sells.

793
00:48:31.046 --> 00:48:32.423
You rigged it.

794
00:48:33.173 --> 00:48:35.009
Fuck the immigrant, yeah?

795
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.095
What was that?

796
00:48:49.523 --> 00:48:50.858
He's alive, men!

797
00:48:51.942 --> 00:48:53.611
Ah fuck.

798
00:48:54.862 --> 00:48:56.989
He's alive!
Christ! Christ, he's alive!


799
00:48:57.072 --> 00:48:59.116
He's alive!
He's alive! He's alive!


800
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.451
We've gotta get him
to the hospital now.


801
00:49:00.534 --> 00:49:02.620
Nah. Nah.
I can't let you do that, Bob.


802
00:49:07.833 --> 00:49:08.792
What?

803
00:49:08.876 --> 00:49:11.128
You can't leave him like this,
Jim!


804
00:49:11.212 --> 00:49:13.964
You're right.
We'll do the decent thing.


805
00:49:14.048 --> 00:49:15.007
What do you mean?

806
00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:16.508
We finish the job we started.

807
00:49:18.219 --> 00:49:21.180
No.
Look, no.


808
00:49:21.263 --> 00:49:22.264
No!

809
00:49:22.973 --> 00:49:23.974
Together.

810
00:49:24.725 --> 00:49:26.393
Oh, fuck off!

811
00:49:26.477 --> 00:49:28.062
Don't forget what we did.

812
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:30.481
Because he won't!

813
00:49:30.564 --> 00:49:32.024
Hey?
He's got lawyers,


814
00:49:32.107 --> 00:49:34.235
reputation and the system
on his side!


815
00:49:34.318 --> 00:49:38.239
We'll get some 2-bit fucking
graduate on two hours kip!


816
00:49:38.322 --> 00:49:40.824
With fucking legal aid,
if we're lucky.


817
00:49:40.908 --> 00:49:42.243
We'll get crucified!

818
00:49:42.326 --> 00:49:44.119
We may as well have
fucking killed him!


819
00:49:44.954 --> 00:49:46.288
No. Hang on a minute,
hang on!


820
00:49:46.372 --> 00:49:51.043
Listen Captain,
I know rich blokes.


821
00:49:51.126 --> 00:49:53.587
They've always got a nest egg
stashed away somewhere.


822
00:49:53.671 --> 00:49:55.923
You know, maybe if you paid us
what we're owed,


823
00:49:56.006 --> 00:49:58.884
we would be more disposed
to us getting you to a hospital.


824
00:49:58.968 --> 00:50:00.427
Let's get this over with,
Dave.


825
00:50:00.511 --> 00:50:02.054
Is there money in the house?

826
00:50:02.137 --> 00:50:05.182
Fucking tell me,
is there money in the house?


827
00:50:05.266 --> 00:50:06.267
What is it?

828
00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.601
He's nodding!
He's fucking nodding!


829
00:50:07.685 --> 00:50:09.478
Did you see him,
he's fucking nodding!


830
00:50:09.562 --> 00:50:12.273
We get the money
and take him to the hospital.


831
00:50:12.356 --> 00:50:14.024
Right now!

832
00:50:14.567 --> 00:50:16.819
Yeah? Please.

833
00:50:23.993 --> 00:50:25.119
Well that's the last of that.

834
00:50:25.202 --> 00:50:27.121
Okay. Right.

835
00:50:27.204 --> 00:50:29.665
It splits it's just over two
and a half grand each.


836
00:50:29.748 --> 00:50:31.792
No.
No, it doesn't work like that.


837
00:50:31.876 --> 00:50:33.210
I'm in a hole, alright?

838
00:50:33.294 --> 00:50:34.837
- There's materials...
- Here she is.


839
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:41.343
What are you doing?

840
00:50:41.427 --> 00:50:43.137
Fuck's sake, Jim!

841
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.806
Dave, it's out money!
We're owed it!


842
00:50:46.932 --> 00:50:48.559
Two, seven, one, zero.

843
00:50:54.023 --> 00:50:55.774
Ah, Jesus Christ.

844
00:50:56.358 --> 00:50:57.943
Oh, Jesus.

845
00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.362
I've been mugged.

846
00:51:06.202 --> 00:51:07.411
Look.

847
00:51:11.582 --> 00:51:13.209
It's an offshore account.

848
00:51:14.501 --> 00:51:16.837
Lads!
It's an offshore account!


849
00:51:18.172 --> 00:51:19.965
You need more than change
for one of these.


850
00:51:22.134 --> 00:51:24.220
- Hey, what about the password?
- He's got it!


851
00:51:33.812 --> 00:51:35.105
Simon...

852
00:51:36.857 --> 00:51:38.275
Simon, listen to me.

853
00:51:39.485 --> 00:51:42.571
Just give us what we're owed
and I will get you to A&E.


854
00:51:42.655 --> 00:51:44.865
I promise you that,
we'll go our separate ways.


855
00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:47.117
You have my word.

856
00:51:49.828 --> 00:51:51.205
Caymans.

857
00:51:51.539 --> 00:51:52.748
Must be nice.

858
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:56.252
Log in.

859
00:51:57.836 --> 00:51:59.505
This is an offshore account

860
00:51:59.588 --> 00:52:02.216
not some fucking
High Street branch.


861
00:52:02.299 --> 00:52:08.180
It's passports, fingerprints,
signatures, the lot.


862
00:52:08.264 --> 00:52:10.057
So, what is there
a transfer option then?


863
00:52:11.308 --> 00:52:12.142
Eh?

864
00:52:12.226 --> 00:52:14.937
You're gonna kill me anyway.

865
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.481
Why the fuck
would I help you?


866
00:52:19.942 --> 00:52:21.735
Just type it in, Simon.

867
00:52:27.908 --> 00:52:30.411
Password. Now.

868
00:52:31.871 --> 00:52:33.497
- Last chance.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


869
00:52:33.581 --> 00:52:35.958
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, hey, hey.


870
00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:38.294
- I'll go bankrupt.
- All this has gone too far.


871
00:52:38.377 --> 00:52:39.879
- It's gotta stop!
- Last chance.


872
00:52:39.962 --> 00:52:41.964
Don't!
Don't do it!


873
00:52:42.047 --> 00:52:43.632
- This has gone too far!
- What the fuck are we doing?


874
00:52:43.716 --> 00:52:45.050
It's gotta stop!

875
00:52:46.468 --> 00:52:47.720
Last chance, Captain.

876
00:52:50.514 --> 00:52:52.349
Password, you fucking...!

877
00:52:54.268 --> 00:52:55.728
Password!

878
00:52:56.395 --> 00:52:58.731
Oh my God!

879
00:52:58.814 --> 00:53:02.109
Patrol 414...
Patrol 414.


880
00:53:02.192 --> 00:53:04.153
You fucking animal!

881
00:53:04.236 --> 00:53:05.696
Jesus!

882
00:53:08.157 --> 00:53:09.950
It says 2.4 million.

883
00:53:13.078 --> 00:53:14.330
Look, it says it!

884
00:53:15.456 --> 00:53:17.333
There's 2.4 million.

885
00:53:19.043 --> 00:53:21.045
Well we should take only
what we are due.


886
00:53:21.128 --> 00:53:23.505
No, we take the lot.

887
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:25.966
A little slither of this worth
a fucking mansion


888
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:27.635
in your mud hole.

889
00:53:27.718 --> 00:53:29.345
We're not thieves.

890
00:53:29.428 --> 00:53:30.930
You don't want your money?

891
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:33.224
Fucking more
for the rest of us.


892
00:53:36.727 --> 00:53:38.312
There'll be a threshold.

893
00:53:39.688 --> 00:53:41.273
Keep it under mil.

894
00:53:48.239 --> 00:53:50.074
Ah, fucking hell!

895
00:53:51.867 --> 00:53:54.078
You bastard.

896
00:53:54.161 --> 00:53:56.705
Well we can't take him to
fucking hospital now, can we?


897
00:54:01.669 --> 00:54:02.545
Phones.

898
00:54:03.462 --> 00:54:05.798
Everyone, put your phones
in the bucket.


899
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:07.925
Put your phones
in the fucking bucket now.


900
00:54:09.969 --> 00:54:11.720
No backstabbing,
no backroom deals.


901
00:54:11.804 --> 00:54:14.139
We're all in this together.
Phones in the bucket now.


902
00:54:19.979 --> 00:54:21.772
We finish this the way
we started.


903
00:54:21.855 --> 00:54:23.232
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

904
00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.321
Together.

905
00:55:03.606 --> 00:55:06.066
I did basic training once,
Captain, when I was a kid.


906
00:55:06.859 --> 00:55:08.277
Just out of my teens.

907
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.196
Judge thought it might
straighten me out.


908
00:55:11.405 --> 00:55:12.865
It was that or jail.

909
00:55:14.867 --> 00:55:16.744
We might have ended up
in the same regiment,


910
00:55:17.912 --> 00:55:19.371
fancy that.

911
00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:23.584
It didn't though,

912
00:55:25.377 --> 00:55:27.129
straighten me out.

913
00:55:31.258 --> 00:55:32.551
Turns out
I've got a low tolerance


914
00:55:32.635 --> 00:55:34.303
for being treated like shit

915
00:55:34.386 --> 00:55:36.639
- by people like you.
- Just get on with it then.


916
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:51.028
Take it.

917
00:56:08.921 --> 00:56:10.339
Dig!

918
00:56:10.422 --> 00:56:12.591
Use the fucking barrow
for Christ's sake,


919
00:56:12.675 --> 00:56:14.593
I can't dig.

920
00:56:15.261 --> 00:56:17.263
We do this together!

921
00:56:17.346 --> 00:56:19.515
Dig! Dig!

922
00:57:42.556 --> 00:57:44.016
Jim's on the run.

923
00:57:45.226 --> 00:57:46.977
He's already killed a guard
in a robbery.


924
00:57:47.895 --> 00:57:49.355
And I knew.

925
00:57:51.106 --> 00:57:52.233
Makes you wonder
what he had planned


926
00:57:52.316 --> 00:57:54.902
if we'd got out money,
don't it?


927
00:58:14.922 --> 00:58:17.049
<i>Simon, darling, are you ready?
We're gonna be late.</i>


928
00:58:18.467 --> 00:58:19.301
Simon?

929
00:58:29.853 --> 00:58:31.188
Simon?

930
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:36.110
Simon?

931
00:58:36.193 --> 00:58:38.112
Shh!
Calm down! Calm down!


932
00:58:38.195 --> 00:58:39.905
It's me, it's me.
It's Viktor.


933
00:58:39.989 --> 00:58:41.782
Calm down.
Calm down, please.


934
00:58:41.866 --> 00:58:44.660
Listen, I'm going
to remove my hand,


935
00:58:44.743 --> 00:58:46.704
but you have to promise
to be silent.


936
00:58:47.746 --> 00:58:50.124
Look, bad things
have happened here.


937
00:58:50.207 --> 00:58:51.750
We have to run away
immediately.


938
00:58:51.834 --> 00:58:55.170
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

939
00:58:57.089 --> 00:58:58.757
Where's Simon?

940
00:58:58.841 --> 00:58:59.842
He's...

941
00:59:00.676 --> 00:59:02.761
Stop!
We must escape now!


942
00:59:16.025 --> 00:59:17.318
Where's Simon?

943
00:59:20.654 --> 00:59:22.364
Where is he, please?

944
00:59:25.492 --> 00:59:27.995
Alright, you see,
it's like this.


945
00:59:28.913 --> 00:59:34.668
I don't know how much he shared
with you about his er,


946
00:59:34.752 --> 00:59:37.087
financial situation...

947
00:59:41.425 --> 00:59:43.886
Financial situation?
Not much.


948
00:59:43.969 --> 00:59:48.140
Okay, because maybe you knew
he was having some problems.


949
00:59:50.851 --> 00:59:56.523
It seems the good captain was
all fur coat and no knickers.


950
00:59:58.692 --> 01:00:00.694
If you'll pardon
the expression.


951
01:00:05.115 --> 01:00:07.618
Obviously, we wish
we'd known sooner but...


952
01:00:07.701 --> 01:00:12.122
it seems that his financial
situation has come to a head


953
01:00:12.206 --> 01:00:15.918
and he has done a bunk.

954
01:00:18.587 --> 01:00:20.422
He's done a bunk?

955
01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:24.635
A bunk, yeah.

956
01:00:27.888 --> 01:00:29.515
Stuck two fingers up
to the tax man


957
01:00:29.598 --> 01:00:32.893
and the bank
and off he has fucked.


958
01:00:33.769 --> 01:00:35.187
Happens more often
than you think,


959
01:00:35.271 --> 01:00:42.653
but it has left us
significantly out of pocket.


960
01:00:46.699 --> 01:00:48.701
I'm sorry to hear that.

961
01:00:50.619 --> 01:00:53.330
Well I'm sorry to break it
to you like this.


962
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.962
Maybe, maybe he thought
he could do the place up,


963
01:01:00.045 --> 01:01:01.881
sell it on,
make a quick profit.


964
01:01:01.964 --> 01:01:03.632
Bail himself out?

965
01:01:04.633 --> 01:01:05.801
Bob?

966
01:01:09.972 --> 01:01:12.224
Explains the tight deadline.

967
01:01:20.107 --> 01:01:21.692
There you go.

968
01:01:24.486 --> 01:01:26.071
Thank you.

969
01:01:47.259 --> 01:01:49.553
Well that's terrible.

970
01:01:50.804 --> 01:01:55.768
Terrible, I mean, after all the
work you've done for him.


971
01:01:58.395 --> 01:02:01.065
Yeah, you can imagine
how we feel.


972
01:02:01.148 --> 01:02:02.483
Hmm.

973
01:02:05.277 --> 01:02:07.029
And you have no idea
where he's gone?


974
01:02:07.112 --> 01:02:08.405
No.

975
01:02:10.783 --> 01:02:11.951
Do you?

976
01:02:12.034 --> 01:02:14.078
No, I have no idea.

977
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:24.046
- There's a joint account.
- A joint account?


978
01:02:24.129 --> 01:02:26.632
Yep. We have one together,
we're engaged.


979
01:02:26.715 --> 01:02:28.050
I could go in to Cardiff
tomorrow morning


980
01:02:28.133 --> 01:02:30.219
and draw the money out.

981
01:02:30.302 --> 01:02:31.637
As Simon's left you
in the lurch


982
01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.181
after all the work you've done,
it only seems fair.


983
01:02:36.767 --> 01:02:38.852
How much is in
the joint account?


984
01:02:40.187 --> 01:02:42.690
Not much,

985
01:02:42.773 --> 01:02:44.692
Something like that.

986
01:02:46.026 --> 01:02:47.236
Probably a fraction of what
you're owed but you know,


987
01:02:47.319 --> 01:02:48.904
if it would help?

988
01:02:56.745 --> 01:02:58.038
I'm sorry I have
to break the news


989
01:02:58.122 --> 01:03:00.249
about your fiancĂ© like this.

990
01:03:04.628 --> 01:03:07.756
You know, I'd been starting to
have second thoughts anyway.


991
01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.091
Guess this seals it.

992
01:03:09.174 --> 01:03:10.634
I guess.

993
01:03:13.429 --> 01:03:14.930
I'm sorry.

994
01:03:19.435 --> 01:03:22.229
Given that the captain
has already run out on us,


995
01:03:22.313 --> 01:03:27.318
I'm sure you will understand
that we are a bit wary


996
01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:30.154
of lightning striking twice.

997
01:03:33.866 --> 01:03:36.076
So, you'll be staying
here tonight.


998
01:03:37.536 --> 01:03:39.663
- But all my things are in the house.
- I know.


999
01:03:39.747 --> 01:03:44.001
But, it's not up
for discussion.


1000
01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:58.599
But Viktor,
you'll be coming with us.


1001
01:04:00.392 --> 01:04:02.895
Where you off to then,
lover boy?


1002
01:04:02.978 --> 01:04:04.563
Riding off into the sunset?

1003
01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:08.067
I just wanted her to be safe.
I didn't have any plan.


1004
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:10.194
Bless! Is she your
girlfriend then, is she?


1005
01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:14.615
- In you get!
- No!


1006
01:04:14.698 --> 01:04:16.408
In you fucking go.

1007
01:04:17.368 --> 01:04:20.037
<i>Guys, it's not funny,
it stinks!</i>


1008
01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.498
<i>Let me out.
Let me out!</i>


1009
01:04:24.124 --> 01:04:25.918
<i>Guys!
Let me out!</i>


1010
01:04:26.001 --> 01:04:27.002
<i>Please!</i>

1011
01:04:27.086 --> 01:04:28.921
<i>Please!</i>

1012
01:04:32.675 --> 01:04:34.134
<i>Guys!</i>

1013
01:04:37.221 --> 01:04:38.597
Bob?

1014
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:43.352
Bob?

1015
01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.398
<i>Bob?</i>

1016
01:04:49.316 --> 01:04:51.026
<i>Bob, I know you're out there.</i>

1017
01:04:52.862 --> 01:04:54.572
Bob, I know you can hear me.

1018
01:05:02.162 --> 01:05:04.331
Bob, I really,

1019
01:05:04.415 --> 01:05:07.209
I really need you to open
this door now, okay?


1020
01:05:12.006 --> 01:05:14.174
You are just a builder though,
right?


1021
01:05:17.761 --> 01:05:20.055
I know you got roped into this.

1022
01:05:25.019 --> 01:05:28.439
You...
you've got a family, Bob.


1023
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:30.941
<i>We talked about them,
remember?</i>


1024
01:05:33.777 --> 01:05:35.905
I can see them
up on this wall, they...


1025
01:05:38.532 --> 01:05:40.034
they look really lovely.

1026
01:05:40.117 --> 01:05:42.953
Your wife, your daughter.

1027
01:05:50.211 --> 01:05:52.671
<i>Imagine if it was her
in here. Huh?</i>


1028
01:06:07.645 --> 01:06:10.147
Bob, I really need you
to let me out, okay?


1029
01:06:30.376 --> 01:06:31.585
Right.

1030
01:06:32.503 --> 01:06:33.837
The money and the bag...

1031
01:06:33.921 --> 01:06:36.131
That puts us close
to what each man's owed.


1032
01:06:37.758 --> 01:06:40.052
It's fill your boots
and split time, Dave.


1033
01:06:40.135 --> 01:06:41.845
Well that split as well,
what do you want to do?


1034
01:06:41.929 --> 01:06:42.846
Four ways or five?

1035
01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:44.014
Four.
Fuck him.


1036
01:06:44.098 --> 01:06:46.767
No, he grafted,
he earned his cash.


1037
01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:48.269
Fuck him!

1038
01:06:49.103 --> 01:06:51.188
He worked twice
as hard as you.


1039
01:06:52.731 --> 01:06:54.358
He gets his cut.

1040
01:06:55.526 --> 01:06:57.236
And we need to get this place
cleaned up.


1041
01:06:58.904 --> 01:07:00.489
Steve...

1042
01:07:00.573 --> 01:07:02.741
Before we go to Cardiff
in the morning...


1043
01:07:02.825 --> 01:07:04.243
Everything.

1044
01:07:05.035 --> 01:07:06.370
Clean.

1045
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.753
What about the girl?

1046
01:07:17.798 --> 01:07:20.801
I think we both know what
has to happen there, Dave.


1047
01:07:22.636 --> 01:07:25.723
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No way.


1048
01:07:25.806 --> 01:07:27.349
She's already seen the blood.

1049
01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.562
She's already hatching plans.

1050
01:07:32.688 --> 01:07:34.523
If she gets to the police,

1051
01:07:35.774 --> 01:07:37.026
we're fucked.

1052
01:07:38.027 --> 01:07:39.403
Yeah, well who?

1053
01:07:39.486 --> 01:07:40.905
Who's gonna do that?

1054
01:07:45.618 --> 01:07:47.203
We play for it.

1055
01:07:56.045 --> 01:07:57.546
Dave.

1056
01:08:20.486 --> 01:08:21.779
<i>Whoa, whoa, what, what?</i>

1057
01:08:21.862 --> 01:08:24.198
<i>What are you doing?
Stop! Fuck.</i>


1058
01:08:50.641 --> 01:08:52.351
You crying?

1059
01:08:56.021 --> 01:08:58.273
You Wendy.

1060
01:08:58.357 --> 01:08:59.984
What's wrong with ya?

1061
01:09:02.987 --> 01:09:08.075
Do you know how many favors
I had to call in


1062
01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:11.579
to keep you out of prison

1063
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:13.914
when you cut that kid up?

1064
01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:23.173
I want you to show me
some respect.


1065
01:09:27.219 --> 01:09:29.763
What, like my dad shows you
some fucking respect?


1066
01:09:30.889 --> 01:09:32.850
He thinks you're a mug,
Uncle Bob.


1067
01:09:34.893 --> 01:09:36.853
He's so right!

1068
01:09:38.063 --> 01:09:39.397
Look at ya.

1069
01:09:39.481 --> 01:09:40.900
Look at ya!

1070
01:09:42.484 --> 01:09:43.902
Do you know he used
to deny that you two


1071
01:09:43.986 --> 01:09:45.321
were related at school?

1072
01:09:48.281 --> 01:09:49.909
Yeah, do you know
what he called ya?


1073
01:09:53.495 --> 01:09:55.371
He calls ya The Provider.

1074
01:09:57.249 --> 01:10:01.920
Yeah, need to borrow the van,
get some money in, hey?


1075
01:10:02.004 --> 01:10:04.255
Get a big round in
for the boys.


1076
01:10:04.339 --> 01:10:07.176
Who you gonna call?
The Provider.


1077
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:13.140
He and my mum always
used to laugh about that.


1078
01:10:14.266 --> 01:10:15.809
What happened to you, Steve?

1079
01:10:17.311 --> 01:10:19.396
Where'd you go?

1080
01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.775
That little kid I used to take
to the footie, hey?


1081
01:10:22.858 --> 01:10:25.444
Jesus fuck.
Jesus Christ.


1082
01:10:25.528 --> 01:10:27.029
You're soft as a bit of shit,
Bob!


1083
01:10:27.112 --> 01:10:30.407
I grew up!
I grew up, Uncle Bob.


1084
01:10:30.491 --> 01:10:32.159
I don't wanna come watch
your shitty football team


1085
01:10:32.243 --> 01:10:34.203
getting dragged about
like an idiot.


1086
01:10:37.998 --> 01:10:39.959
Come on. Jim said
scrub the place up now.


1087
01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:41.001
Come on.

1088
01:10:41.085 --> 01:10:43.462
Hey, Bob,
don't forget your apron!


1089
01:10:45.381 --> 01:10:47.758
You're a disappointment,
Steve.


1090
01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:07.319
What you been doing?

1091
01:11:09.572 --> 01:11:11.198
What do you want?

1092
01:11:11.574 --> 01:11:13.033
Just wanna come
have a little chat.


1093
01:11:18.289 --> 01:11:20.165
Where you going, huh?
Huh?


1094
01:11:54.867 --> 01:11:56.243
He attacked her.

1095
01:12:20.142 --> 01:12:21.644
Help, Bob!

1096
01:12:30.986 --> 01:12:32.238
Shoot him, Uncle Bob!

1097
01:12:34.865 --> 01:12:36.283
He's gonna kill us both,
you know it!


1098
01:12:36.367 --> 01:12:39.078
Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim!

1099
01:12:42.915 --> 01:12:43.791
Jim!

1100
01:12:57.596 --> 01:12:58.889
Come on.

1101
01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:16.824
<i>Where have you been?
Eh?</i>


1102
01:13:16.907 --> 01:13:18.284
<i>That's all I'm asking you
Where have you been?</i>


1103
01:13:18.367 --> 01:13:19.618
<i>None of your fucking business.</i>

1104
01:13:19.702 --> 01:13:21.036
<i>I've been looking
everywhere for you.</i>


1105
01:13:22.413 --> 01:13:24.123
<i>Don't go fucking
disappearing again, Dave.</i>


1106
01:13:24.206 --> 01:13:25.207
<i>I'm 72,
I can look after myself.</i>


1107
01:13:25.291 --> 01:13:27.126
<i>Let me handle this.</i>

1108
01:13:36.176 --> 01:13:37.136
What happened?

1109
01:13:37.219 --> 01:13:38.804
Where is she?

1110
01:13:38.888 --> 01:13:39.722
Bob?

1111
01:13:39.805 --> 01:13:41.265
He attacked her.

1112
01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:44.810
I know he's hardly the biggest
loss to man kind's gene pool,


1113
01:13:44.894 --> 01:13:47.396
but Bob, for fuck's sake,
you skewered your own nephew!


1114
01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:50.190
No.

1115
01:13:50.274 --> 01:13:51.817
Not me.

1116
01:13:51.901 --> 01:13:53.235
The Russian?

1117
01:13:56.197 --> 01:13:58.866
You check the woods,
take his car, bigger beams.


1118
01:13:58.949 --> 01:14:01.535
Bob, wake up
for fuck's sake, he's dead!


1119
01:14:01.619 --> 01:14:02.661
Okay?

1120
01:14:03.621 --> 01:14:05.206
Check the fields.

1121
01:14:05.289 --> 01:14:06.957
I'll check the perimeter.

1122
01:14:07.041 --> 01:14:08.667
Then we'll take the van.

1123
01:14:08.751 --> 01:14:10.252
Beams and horns
if we find him, okay?


1124
01:14:10.336 --> 01:14:13.005
If we don't have him in 2 hours,
we meet back here.


1125
01:14:13.088 --> 01:14:15.799
We divvy up, we split.
Okay? Agreed?


1126
01:14:16.383 --> 01:14:18.260
How do we know
that you are not going to


1127
01:14:18.344 --> 01:14:20.012
fuck off with that bag?

1128
01:14:21.096 --> 01:14:23.432
Dave, fucking...

1129
01:14:23.515 --> 01:14:26.435
If they get to a phone,
we're all fucked.


1130
01:14:27.186 --> 01:14:28.896
This isn't a fucking game,
Dave!


1131
01:14:30.272 --> 01:14:31.649
Move!

1132
01:17:08.097 --> 01:17:09.640
Okay.

1133
01:17:16.939 --> 01:17:18.732
I didn't need saving.

1134
01:17:24.113 --> 01:17:25.823
I couldn't leave you.

1135
01:17:31.996 --> 01:17:34.039
Here, open it.

1136
01:17:39.044 --> 01:17:41.839
I save some,
I send some.


1137
01:17:43.382 --> 01:17:45.551
I just want a better
life for us.


1138
01:17:47.094 --> 01:17:49.305
That's Sofiya, my daughter.

1139
01:17:51.348 --> 01:17:52.808
She's smart like you.

1140
01:17:54.393 --> 01:17:56.020
You would like her.

1141
01:18:05.571 --> 01:18:07.364
You never loved Simon?

1142
01:18:10.743 --> 01:18:14.121
So who are you?
What do you want?


1143
01:18:23.839 --> 01:18:25.799
I'm the same as you.

1144
01:18:34.266 --> 01:18:35.851
What happened to Simon?

1145
01:18:38.896 --> 01:18:40.689
Please, tell me.

1146
01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:49.698
He treated them, us,
like shit.


1147
01:18:52.368 --> 01:18:55.412
Shake a bottle long enough,
it explodes.


1148
01:18:57.498 --> 01:19:01.585
Viktor, is he dead?

1149
01:19:08.634 --> 01:19:09.843
Where is he?

1150
01:19:09.927 --> 01:19:11.845
It doesn't matter.
He is dead.


1151
01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:15.349
Where is he?
Tell me!


1152
01:19:15.432 --> 01:19:17.184
Under the concrete.
The cesspit.


1153
01:19:19.019 --> 01:19:20.896
Keep him talking.

1154
01:19:28.737 --> 01:19:30.739
I see she dropped
the dead weight.


1155
01:19:37.246 --> 01:19:39.039
You been saving your pennies?

1156
01:19:42.501 --> 01:19:45.212
<i>Just as well seeing how
this played out.</i>


1157
01:19:45.296 --> 01:19:46.255
Hello.

1158
01:19:46.338 --> 01:19:47.840
<i>Come on,</i>

1159
01:19:50.175 --> 01:19:51.677
in the bag.

1160
01:19:52.428 --> 01:19:53.429
No.

1161
01:19:54.513 --> 01:19:56.056
Give me the money.

1162
01:19:57.016 --> 01:20:00.436
I can kill you and take it,
or I can just take it.


1163
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:02.771
It's your call.

1164
01:20:03.647 --> 01:20:05.441
It's for my daughter.

1165
01:20:06.692 --> 01:20:08.152
She won't miss it.

1166
01:20:08.986 --> 01:20:09.945
Trust me,

1167
01:20:11.906 --> 01:20:14.450
best she learns that
you can't rely on family.


1168
01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.746
Then she can stand
on her own two feet.


1169
01:20:21.415 --> 01:20:24.376
You were never gonna get it
to her anyway, Viktor.


1170
01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.878
Look at you.

1171
01:20:26.545 --> 01:20:27.421
You're fucked!

1172
01:21:44.206 --> 01:21:46.083
Police please.

1173
01:21:49.503 --> 01:21:51.672
My name is Bob Pearson.

1174
01:23:14.922 --> 01:23:16.882
Sorry about this, old boy!

1175
01:24:03.262 --> 01:24:05.431
I can't feel my legs.

1176
01:24:10.895 --> 01:24:13.063
You're losing too much blood.

1177
01:24:17.067 --> 01:24:21.697
I'm sorry for Simon.

1178
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:27.620
I know.

1179
01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.837
But you've fucked it all up.

1180
01:24:45.804 --> 01:24:47.640
Ugh. Jesus!

1181
01:24:58.150 --> 01:24:59.985
Let's keep it professional.

1182
01:25:00.069 --> 01:25:01.987
Well we're on Plan B.

1183
01:25:02.071 --> 01:25:04.615
We've got finger prints,
passport,


1184
01:25:04.698 --> 01:25:06.450
bank manager's never met him.

1185
01:25:07.117 --> 01:25:08.202
Yeah, great.

1186
01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.580
Eighteen months
reeling him in.


1187
01:25:11.664 --> 01:25:13.374
Bloody cavemen!

1188
01:25:20.965 --> 01:25:23.467
- He saved me.
- He looks fucked.


1189
01:25:24.593 --> 01:25:26.971
You know, Simon thought
you had a thing for him.


1190
01:25:34.979 --> 01:25:36.605
Petty cash!

1191
01:25:36.689 --> 01:25:38.190
Jesus!

1192
01:27:01.565 --> 01:27:03.400
Go and get the bag.

1193
01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:06.111
Did you think about it
when he popped the question?


1194
01:27:06.195 --> 01:27:07.780
<i>Marrying into it?</i>

1195
01:27:07.863 --> 01:27:10.950
<i>Coffee mornings,
bringing up little captains?</i>


1196
01:27:11.033 --> 01:27:12.826
<i>So the finger arrives
by medical courier</i>


1197
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:14.828
<i>45 minutes after we do.</i>

1198
01:27:14.912 --> 01:27:17.498
<i>Let's hope Plan B works
or we're screwed.</i>


1199
01:27:17.581 --> 01:27:19.917
<i>Petty cash and a few quid
in the bag for 18 months</i>


1200
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:20.918
<i>playing the mark...</i>

1201
01:27:21.001 --> 01:27:23.629
I'll get this to her,
I promise.


1202
01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:32.763
A life away from all this.

1203
01:27:39.728 --> 01:27:40.938
Amy?

1204
01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:45.734
Amy?

1205
01:29:15.974 --> 01:29:20.974
