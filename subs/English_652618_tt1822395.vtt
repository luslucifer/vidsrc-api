1
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.132
- How did I not see that?

2
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:42.840
- Hey, I'm not here to protect
your drink.


3
00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:45.631
While you were gone, this guy
drank it.


4
00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:50.007
- Gimme another.

5
00:02:56.965 --> 00:03:00.881
- I'm sorry, mister, I
thought it was free drink.


6
00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:03.173
- Nothing's free anymore.

7
00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:05.048
- I will pay.

8
00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.173
I have no money.

9
00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:17.048
- Forget it.

10
00:03:17.132 --> 00:03:19.756
- But I would like to buy you
drink.


11
00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:21.840
- I'll buy you one.

12
00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:22.840
What are you having?

13
00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:26.965
- Tequila.

14
00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:29.299
- We get a shot of Titanium
please?


15
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.507
Thank you, mister uh--

16
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.465
- Monroe.

17
00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:51.215
-  Monroe.

18
00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:03.673
Would you
like to see my friends?


19
00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:06.549
- No time, gotta meet someone.

20
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:08.257
- I will make fast.

21
00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.465
- How long you had those guys?

22
00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:24.132
- This one is not guy.

23
00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:27.382
This one is girl.

24
00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:29.007
His girl.

25
00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:34.424
Usually, Putin waits

26
00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:37.715
until Gorbachev is eating.

27
00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:42.424
And then when his back is
turned,


28
00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:44.715
he has his way with Ana.

29
00:04:47.382 --> 00:04:50.215
Maybe you can see when you have
more time.


30
00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:57.549
Would you like to kiss Ana?

31
00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.631
- No thanks.

32
00:04:58.715 --> 00:04:59.382
- Make sure you take your
friends with you


33
00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.673
when you leave.

34
00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:03.549
- Da, Yelena.

35
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.382
I like you, Mr.
Monroe.


36
00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:22.756
One more before you go.

37
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.881
- Think I need to take a leak.

38
00:05:34.756 --> 00:05:36.965
- Think I'll take it outside.

39
00:05:37.048 --> 00:05:39.007
-  Citizens
throughout the Western Territory


40
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.173
gathered today to remember
the loss of human lives


41
00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.507
resulting from the virus.

42
00:06:01.507 --> 00:06:04.840
Thought that you said bye to me.

43
00:06:32.132 --> 00:06:32.631
-  Speaking
in Chinese.


44
00:06:40.465 --> 00:06:44.215
Next train arriving at Midtown
Station in four minutes.


45
00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:52.756
-  4112 standby.

46
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:58.340
Good evening, Harry.

47
00:06:58.424 --> 00:07:03.132
You have six priority messages
from Chief Inspector Carter.


48
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.507
- Call Carter.

49
00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:17.881
-  Harrison?

50
00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:19.257
-  Yeah.

51
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.173
-  Where have you been?

52
00:07:22.007 --> 00:07:23.299
-  Off the grid.

53
00:07:23.382 --> 00:07:24.798
Call it a vacation.

54
00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:25.923
-  Next time you go on
vacation,


55
00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:28.340
do me a favor and let me know.

56
00:07:28.424 --> 00:07:30.007
-  Not my job to anymore.

57
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.715
Besides--

58
00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:32.007
-  Monroe was hit.

59
00:07:35.382 --> 00:07:36.132
-  How bad?

60
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.715
Carter?

61
00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:43.965
-  He didn't make it.

62
00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:48.132
Taft wants to meet.

63
00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:49.090
- When?

64
00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:54.215
-  I'll forward
you the location and time.


65
00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:13.840
-  Monroe's data scan came
back


66
00:08:13.923 --> 00:08:16.340
with traces of Dropa DNA.

67
00:08:16.424 --> 00:08:17.715
-  So what brought it
out?


68
00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.798
-  Oh what the hell
are you asking me for?


69
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:21.215
I mean survival instincts I
guess.


70
00:08:23.132 --> 00:08:25.215
They're damn flesh pods, Harry.

71
00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:28.257
Who the hell knows why
they do what they do?


72
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.715
-  You got a tracker on
this Dropa?


73
00:08:29.798 --> 00:08:32.715
- Not yet.

74
00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:36.340
-  So what do you need
from me?


75
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:41.382
- Well, Monroe had this on him.

76
00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:46.340
It's a cell number, untraceable.

77
00:08:46.424 --> 00:08:50.673
So I want you to go back to the
Dry Dock.


78
00:08:50.756 --> 00:08:52.424
Bartender may know something.

79
00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:56.173
Poke around, ask some questions,
dig.


80
00:08:56.257 --> 00:08:57.424
It's what you're good at.

81
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.549
That's your gift.

82
00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:05.465
- So I'm your tracker?

83
00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:08.673
I'm not even sure I
have that gift anymore.


84
00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:10.840
- If that thing can find
Monroe, it can sure as hell


85
00:09:10.923 --> 00:09:12.881
find any one of us and you
better pray


86
00:09:12.965 --> 00:09:14.881
it's working alone otherwise we
are all


87
00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:16.424
in for a world of hurt.

88
00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:21.132
Now, there is one more thing.

89
00:09:22.631 --> 00:09:26.424
I want you to go see Dr. Glenka
at the Leeland Institute.


90
00:09:28.048 --> 00:09:28.881
- A psych test.

91
00:09:28.965 --> 00:09:29.840
- Yeah.

92
00:09:30.798 --> 00:09:32.048
Well I gotta know if
my dog can still hunt.


93
00:09:32.132 --> 00:09:34.756
You're no good to me otherwise.

94
00:09:49.424 --> 00:09:50.465
-  Let us move past
the war.


95
00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:00.923
We are going to need to
start the sequence again


96
00:10:01.007 --> 00:10:04.090
if you don't focus.

97
00:10:04.173 --> 00:10:05.340
Please concentrate.

98
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.673
-  Give me a second.

99
00:10:13.507 --> 00:10:14.756
-  Your childhood
again?


100
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.507
-  Yeah.

101
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.756
-  Was this a good
day?


102
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.340
-  It was a day.

103
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.465
-  How are you
feeling in that moment?


104
00:10:26.382 --> 00:10:28.090
-  Safe, maybe.

105
00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:31.173
Protected.

106
00:10:33.715 --> 00:10:37.673
-  Come on,
stay with the machine.


107
00:10:45.881 --> 00:10:49.382
You were born into a military
family, no?


108
00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:51.215
-  You already know this.

109
00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.215
-  Why are
you going back to her?


110
00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:57.299
Focus.

111
00:10:58.215 --> 00:10:59.132
-  I'm tired of this.

112
00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:02.299
We are almost done.

113
00:11:02.382 --> 00:11:03.132
-  We're done.

114
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.631
Well?

115
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.048
- Solid nerves.

116
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.465
- No rust?

117
00:11:21.007 --> 00:11:23.299
- Not exactly.

118
00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:24.007
- Your motivation rate is lower

119
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.340
than in your previous tests.

120
00:11:25.424 --> 00:11:28.840
- Well, it has been
eight years


121
00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.007
since my last test.

122
00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:37.881
So what does that mean?

123
00:11:39.424 --> 00:11:42.382
- Your mind kept wandering
and that bothers me.


124
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.507
- Uh huh.

125
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.132
- Considering the nature of your
visit


126
00:11:47.215 --> 00:11:48.549
it could be....

127
00:11:50.549 --> 00:11:50.590
- What?

128
00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:54.173
- Unhealthy.

129
00:11:57.631 --> 00:11:59.132
Today is your birthday.

130
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.132
You haven't put in to leave?

131
00:12:04.215 --> 00:12:05.090
- Nope.

132
00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:08.299
- You're going to be over the
age limit.


133
00:12:09.673 --> 00:12:13.257
- Look, I could
make an infinite list


134
00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.673
of complaints about living in
this city,


135
00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:20.715
on this planet too but I'd
still much rather be here


136
00:12:20.798 --> 00:12:21.590
than up there.

137
00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:25.881
- Are you so sure about that?

138
00:12:46.923 --> 00:12:47.798
- Why didn't you go?

139
00:12:49.465 --> 00:12:51.798
- My husband was too weak for
the trip.


140
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:52.507
He's a virus survivor.

141
00:12:55.048 --> 00:12:55.507
- But if you could?

142
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.965
- The Moon Colony, no.

143
00:13:04.048 --> 00:13:06.132
My job is down here.

144
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.923
Mr. Harrison, when this is done,

145
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.631
whatever it is,

146
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.715
my advice is for you to leave
the city.


147
00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:39.132
- I need employment profile
verification


148
00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:41.631
for bartenders at the Dry Dock
Bar.


149
00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:48.424
Employer ID registration, 198643
bravo.


150
00:13:49.048 --> 00:13:50.549
-  One owner, ten
employees.


151
00:13:50.631 --> 00:13:54.215
Three are bartenders,
no illegals reported.


152
00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:55.215
- How many female bartenders?

153
00:13:55.299 --> 00:13:57.090
-  Two.

154
00:13:57.173 --> 00:13:58.257
- Process.

155
00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.299
-  Based
on the crime scene report


156
00:13:59.382 --> 00:14:01.173
we are looking for Helen Adamov,

157
00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.340
age 28, Soviet immigrant.

158
00:14:03.424 --> 00:14:07.090
Address 1307 Baton Street.

159
00:14:07.173 --> 00:14:09.132
Employed nine months and four
days.


160
00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.173
- I need her education

161
00:14:11.257 --> 00:14:13.507
her cell records for the last 48
hours,


162
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.631
and RFID log.

163
00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:18.673
Well?

164
00:14:18.756 --> 00:14:19.881
-  Interesting.

165
00:14:19.965 --> 00:14:21.299
- What?

166
00:14:21.382 --> 00:14:23.173
-  Classified
clearance level A12 required.


167
00:14:23.257 --> 00:14:26.340
No additional data available.

168
00:14:26.424 --> 00:14:27.840
Attempting to access.

169
00:14:47.007 --> 00:14:48.132
- Hold up, bro.

170
00:14:48.215 --> 00:14:54.090
Yeah, you're good.

171
00:15:22.132 --> 00:15:23.424
- I'm looking for the bartender
who worked last night.


172
00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.715
- Yelena?

173
00:15:26.798 --> 00:15:27.798
- Helen Adamov.

174
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.173
-  What?

175
00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:37.424
- Helen, Yelena.

176
00:15:40.798 --> 00:15:40.840
- Where is she?

177
00:15:42.424 --> 00:15:44.173
- Is she in some kind of
trouble?


178
00:15:51.257 --> 00:15:53.507
In dressing room four.

179
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.798
- I'd like to have a word with
you.


180
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:22.048
- That's more than a word,
genius.


181
00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.507
- I'm looking for someone.

182
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.881
He knows a friend of mine.

183
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:28.923
- Go on.

184
00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:32.048
- He was here last night.

185
00:16:35.048 --> 00:16:36.007
Big Russian guy.

186
00:16:37.756 --> 00:16:42.090
- Hmm, I know a lot of big
Russian guys.


187
00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:46.881
- Well, how many were here last
night?


188
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.299
- None that I remember.

189
00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:05.549
I think it's time for you to go.

190
00:17:06.756 --> 00:17:11.257
Unless you can think of
another reason to stick around.


191
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.965
Hmm, pretty.

192
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.840
Goodbye, mister--

193
00:17:22.923 --> 00:17:22.965
- Harrison.

194
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:30.965
- Your name's Helen Adamov.

195
00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:35.715
Born to Russian immigrant
parents Yuri and Kira Kosov.


196
00:17:35.798 --> 00:17:39.007
Both killed in a train
wreck outside Boston.


197
00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.424
Your father's sister,
Dasha Adamov, raised you.


198
00:17:42.507 --> 00:17:44.382
She was Assistant to the
Minister


199
00:17:44.465 --> 00:17:46.465
of Socialist American Affairs.

200
00:17:47.173 --> 00:17:49.132
At age fifteen you were enrolled

201
00:17:49.215 --> 00:17:50.299
in the Military Intelligence
Academy,


202
00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:52.673
and excelled academically.

203
00:17:53.424 --> 00:17:54.923
Eight years later, you were part

204
00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.590
of the Moon Colony's Project
Horizon Two.


205
00:17:58.631 --> 00:18:02.382
Then, nine months ago,
you became a bartender


206
00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:05.590
in a dive in the East Sector.

207
00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:08.756
Should I keep going?

208
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.090
- If you know me the way you
claim,


209
00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:13.715
then you know it's best to leave
me alone.


210
00:18:15.507 --> 00:18:17.257
- October 7th, you left the city

211
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.299
for two weeks, just disappeared.

212
00:18:20.173 --> 00:18:22.382
There's no record of your
transport pass


213
00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:23.923
or RFID being scanned anywhere.

214
00:18:26.132 --> 00:18:26.923
How is that possible?

215
00:18:30.132 --> 00:18:33.299
You know what happened here
last night so one more time,


216
00:18:33.382 --> 00:18:35.090
where is this man?

217
00:18:35.756 --> 00:18:37.923
I need to find him.

218
00:18:38.007 --> 00:18:39.257
- Who are you?

219
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.590
- I'm the guy that's gonna
find the Dropa flesh bag


220
00:18:41.673 --> 00:18:42.549
that killed my friend.

221
00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:45.215
- The Dropas are dead

222
00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:47.798
just like your friend.

223
00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:50.923
- It's a simple question.

224
00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:53.631
- Things aren't
always what they seem.


225
00:18:55.881 --> 00:18:57.132
I need to find him.

226
00:18:57.215 --> 00:18:58.798
Who are you?

227
00:18:58.881 --> 00:19:00.090
-  I'm
the guy


228
00:19:00.173 --> 00:19:01.465
that's gonna find the Dropa
flesh bag


229
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:02.756
that killed my friend.

230
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.507
The Dropas are dead

231
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.631
just like your friend.

232
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.965
It's a simple question.

233
00:19:11.048 --> 00:19:11.465
Things aren't always

234
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:13.340
what they seem.

235
00:19:23.215 --> 00:19:26.923
Did your research happen to
mention that I've had four years


236
00:19:27.007 --> 00:19:28.299
of combat training?

237
00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:32.048
- Eleven years of real combat.

238
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.424
I've killed for a lot less
reason.


239
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.132
- This is bigger than us, Mr.
Harrison.


240
00:19:57.007 --> 00:19:58.673
Your friend was
a part of The Legion


241
00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:01.090
and my guess is, you were too.

242
00:20:02.923 --> 00:20:04.798
Murders stack up down here
and no one investigates


243
00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:07.673
unless it was someone that
mattered.


244
00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:09.673
How could any of you expect to
walk away


245
00:20:09.756 --> 00:20:10.631
from what you did?

246
00:20:10.715 --> 00:20:12.715
- Their cocoons carried the
virus spores


247
00:20:12.798 --> 00:20:13.798
that nearly wiped us out.

248
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:17.048
The only thing that stopped
them was The Legion.


249
00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.465
- Mr. Harrison, do you know what
it's like


250
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:21.549
to lose everything, your
home, the people you love?


251
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:25.173
- I don't care about your moral
cause.


252
00:20:26.756 --> 00:20:28.048
Where is it?

253
00:20:28.132 --> 00:20:28.756
- I don't know.

254
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.631
- This is not a negotiation.

255
00:20:31.715 --> 00:20:33.507
If you can't help me,
I have other options.


256
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.465
You don't.

257
00:20:38.215 --> 00:20:41.173
- He has a room at the Grand
Hotel in the Lower Quarter.


258
00:20:41.257 --> 00:20:42.631
- I know the place.

259
00:20:42.715 --> 00:20:47.673
- Room 832, name's Mikhail,
no last name, just Mikhail.


260
00:20:48.673 --> 00:20:49.007
- Why did you go there?

261
00:20:50.881 --> 00:20:52.590
- He asked me to contact Mr.
Monroe


262
00:20:52.673 --> 00:20:53.965
to leave him a message.

263
00:20:54.048 --> 00:20:54.090
- What message?

264
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.549
- A note with a number.

265
00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:58.090
I left it at his apartment.

266
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.382
-  What did the note say?

267
00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:03.382
- There's a traitor in The
Legion.


268
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.257
- A traitor?

269
00:21:06.424 --> 00:21:08.090
More!

270
00:21:08.173 --> 00:21:09.881
- That's it I swear.

271
00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.631
My father fought for the Dropa's
rights


272
00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:24.549
when they came here.

273
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:26.923
Then The Party killed him for
it.


274
00:21:27.007 --> 00:21:27.048
My mother too.

275
00:21:30.132 --> 00:21:31.756
He would tell me that
people were so afraid


276
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840
that the world was going to end

277
00:21:32.923 --> 00:21:35.215
that they were actually
hoping that it would.


278
00:21:36.048 --> 00:21:40.631
You know, it's easier to
give up, to live in fear.


279
00:21:40.715 --> 00:21:41.756
That's what those in control
want you


280
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.965
to feel, powerless,
insignificant.


281
00:21:48.215 --> 00:21:52.173
But the Dropas came here
and they made us realize


282
00:21:52.257 --> 00:21:55.007
that there's more out
there in the universe.


283
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.340
They gave us hope.

284
00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:05.215
What do you believe in?

285
00:22:07.215 --> 00:22:10.132
- If the hotel doesn't
check out I'm coming back.


286
00:22:10.215 --> 00:22:13.923
And trust me, you don't
want me to come back.


287
00:22:14.007 --> 00:22:15.590
- You won't be back.

288
00:22:15.673 --> 00:22:19.132
Mikhail just may find you
first if he hasn't already.


289
00:22:19.215 --> 00:22:21.007
-  That would
make my job easier.


290
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.382
- Was it easy before?

291
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.048
-  Welcome home,
Harry.


292
00:24:02.881 --> 00:24:06.424
Daily status, one missed VidFon
call,


293
00:24:06.507 --> 00:24:09.132
eleven unread email
transmissions.


294
00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:11.965
Fusion energy bill, 19 days past
due.


295
00:24:13.007 --> 00:24:15.590
-  Enough already,
C.O.N.T.A.G.


296
00:24:15.673 --> 00:24:17.215
Can I just have a few minutes?

297
00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:19.299
Alone?

298
00:24:22.631 --> 00:24:25.215
-  Harry, I
have something else to say.


299
00:24:26.881 --> 00:24:27.756
- What?

300
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:31.382

323

-  DNA sweep?

324
00:26:28.007 --> 00:26:29.299
- Clean.

325
00:26:29.382 --> 00:26:30.631
-  Clean?

326
00:26:30.715 --> 00:26:33.715
- Nothing, only established
samples.


327
00:26:33.798 --> 00:26:35.590
We're scanning the staff and
patrons again


328
00:26:35.673 --> 00:26:37.756
to make sure we didn't overlook
anything.


329
00:26:40.715 --> 00:26:41.840
- Professional.

330
00:26:43.424 --> 00:26:45.798
-  Does this
remind you of something?


331
00:27:03.257 --> 00:27:04.507
- Inspector Carter.

332
00:29:29.923 --> 00:29:32.507
trolley whirring

333
00:29:46.965 --> 00:29:49.173
- You wanna tell me what
happened last night?


334
00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.507
The woman you questioned
last night is dead.


335
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:58.631
Her eye sockets were crushed in.

336
00:30:00.756 --> 00:30:03.840
I've seen a few Dropas you
finished off look the same way.


337
00:30:05.215 --> 00:30:06.881
- She was breathing when I left.

338
00:30:10.215 --> 00:30:13.048
- Can you explain this?

339
00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:25.173
Well?

340
00:30:28.881 --> 00:30:30.840
- She must have removed it
when I was questioning her.


341
00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:32.549
- And?

342
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:38.590
- She was trying to
manipulate the situation.


343
00:30:38.673 --> 00:30:42.090
She was very, persuasive.

344
00:30:44.257 --> 00:30:46.173
- I've got eyewitnesses
that put you at the Dry Dock


345
00:30:46.257 --> 00:30:49.048
at the same time as the murder.

346
00:30:54.715 --> 00:30:55.507
- What are you implying?

347
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.507
- Implying?

348
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.549
Nothing, except that I
just covered your ass.


349
00:31:03.382 --> 00:31:04.798
Taft can't end up with a trail
of bodies


350
00:31:04.881 --> 00:31:06.299
leading back to this Dropa.

351
00:31:06.382 --> 00:31:07.756
- Yeah, that wouldn't
look good, now would it?


352
00:31:09.965 --> 00:31:11.173
- We're on our own out here.

353
00:31:11.257 --> 00:31:14.590
It's about survival now, ours!

354
00:31:15.923 --> 00:31:16.590
We let these Dropas walk away.

355
00:31:16.673 --> 00:31:19.173
Now they're back to finish us.

356
00:31:19.257 --> 00:31:20.465
- Can you blame 'em?

357
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.840
- I've done some pretty
bad things, Harrison,


358
00:31:30.798 --> 00:31:32.549
things that I can't take back.

359
00:31:32.631 --> 00:31:36.090
- You did them to protect the
cause


360
00:31:36.173 --> 00:31:37.507
like all of us.

361
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.090
- That's The Party's line.

362
00:31:39.173 --> 00:31:41.382
We did it because we had no
other choice.


363
00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:43.881
You do what you're ordered to do

364
00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:45.507
and don't ask questions.

365
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.631
- You chose the lesser of two
evils.


366
00:31:49.382 --> 00:31:51.090
Just learn to live with it.

367
00:31:51.173 --> 00:31:52.048
I did.

368
00:31:54.007 --> 00:31:54.798
- You're no saint in all of
this.


369
00:31:57.048 --> 00:32:00.257
- I know.

370
00:32:31.507 --> 00:32:33.090
-  Warning, two
rounds


371
00:32:33.173 --> 00:32:35.173
of plasma ammunition loaded.

372
00:32:35.257 --> 00:32:38.840
Restricted use due to potential
thermal burns to civilians.


373
00:33:02.424 --> 00:33:07.465
Coming, I'm coming.

374
00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.549
What do you want?

375
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:16.840
Come on, Jin, play nice.

376
00:33:16.923 --> 00:33:18.590
- I'm play nice up your fucking
asshole!


377
00:33:18.673 --> 00:33:19.382
You wrecked my place pretty bad
last time.


378
00:33:19.465 --> 00:33:21.299
- It was a long time ago.

379
00:33:21.382 --> 00:33:22.673
- Come on, get out!

380
00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.007
right to barge in huh?

381
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.257
Just like that?

382
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.923
Geez.

383
00:33:36.007 --> 00:33:39.007
You have no respect for
other people's property.


384
00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.007
- You're my eyes down here, Jin.

385
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:41.923
You always have been.

386
00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:48.549
The Legion needs your help.

387
00:33:48.631 --> 00:33:49.798
- The Legion no more.

388
00:33:50.881 --> 00:33:52.048
Those days are gone.

389
00:33:52.132 --> 00:33:57.090
Uh, I don't owe Legion
for nothing, no more.


390
00:33:57.881 --> 00:33:59.673
- Well, consider it a favor
then.


391
00:33:59.756 --> 00:34:02.840
- No, your kind of favor,
bad news, bad news.


392
00:34:02.923 --> 00:34:05.299
- I'm looking for the tenant in
room 832.


393
00:34:05.382 --> 00:34:06.590
- Don't know nothing.

394
00:34:07.507 --> 00:34:08.840
What number?

395
00:34:08.923 --> 00:34:09.631
-  832.

396
00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:12.257
- Ah, nobody lives there.

397
00:34:25.465 --> 00:34:27.465
- Catch your breath.

398
00:34:27.549 --> 00:34:28.840
I just need a minute of your
time.


399
00:34:28.923 --> 00:34:31.840
- No, no minute for you.

400
00:34:45.673 --> 00:34:46.590
- Make time.

401
00:35:02.507 --> 00:35:05.673
- Ah, now I remember.

402
00:35:05.756 --> 00:35:11.673
A big man, a big man, name
Mikhail.


403
00:35:14.173 --> 00:35:15.507
What do you want with him?

404
00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.007
- It's personal.

405
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:17.132
Gimme the key.

406
00:35:19.007 --> 00:35:21.215
- Huh, personal, everything's
personal with you,


407
00:35:21.299 --> 00:35:22.340
means big trouble.

408
00:35:22.424 --> 00:35:24.340
- The key Jin.

409
00:35:25.465 --> 00:35:29.507
- Are you gonna bust
up my place again, huh?


410
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.965
Listen, he's a good tenant,
model tenant.


411
00:35:34.048 --> 00:35:35.173
Always pays the rent.

412
00:35:35.257 --> 00:35:37.590
- Your model tenant is a Dropa.

413
00:35:37.673 --> 00:35:39.507
- What?

414
00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.048
- And I'm taking him out of
here with or without the key.


415
00:35:42.132 --> 00:35:43.299
You understand?

416
00:38:55.507 --> 00:38:59.507
- I believe you have something
that does not belong to you.


417
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.007
- Come and get it.

418
00:40:58.465 --> 00:41:02.215
known fact can become a

419
00:41:02.299 --> 00:41:05.299
well known fact and part of
our job, Harry, is to make sure


420
00:41:05.382 --> 00:41:06.881
that don't happen.

421
00:41:07.881 --> 00:41:12.756
Now, how in the hell are we
gonna do that


422
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.215
if you start trying to blow away
Dropas


423
00:41:15.299 --> 00:41:18.048
in front of a damn audience
in the Lower Quarter?


424
00:41:18.965 --> 00:41:19.840
Well?

425
00:41:35.798 --> 00:41:37.923
- Got something for ya.

426
00:41:39.465 --> 00:41:41.257
Found that in the Russian's
room at the Grand Hotel.


427
00:41:45.424 --> 00:41:47.673
- Now, why in the hell are you
showing me


428
00:41:47.756 --> 00:41:49.465
half a damn cockroach?

429
00:41:51.923 --> 00:41:53.257
This is cybernetic.

430
00:41:54.923 --> 00:41:56.299
That's pretty advanced
technology for a Dropa.


431
00:41:59.257 --> 00:42:01.340
Kinda like them bug bots we
used to use back in the day.


432
00:42:01.424 --> 00:42:03.715
- Yeah, I thought it might
be a surveillance tool


433
00:42:03.798 --> 00:42:06.507
or a weapon but it's not.

434
00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.048
Took me a moment to figure it
out.


435
00:42:09.132 --> 00:42:10.340
-  Figure what out?

436
00:42:11.257 --> 00:42:12.215
- It's a decoy,

437
00:42:13.756 --> 00:42:16.007
an elaborate decoy, but decoy
nonetheless.


438
00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.715
- I'm not following this.

439
00:42:19.048 --> 00:42:21.340
- The Dropas have a
different magnetic makeup


440
00:42:21.424 --> 00:42:22.507
than anything else on this
planet.


441
00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:26.257
The magnetic field around
them throws the compass cells


442
00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.465
in roaches crazy.

443
00:42:27.549 --> 00:42:30.715
- All right, all right,
professor, please plain English.


444
00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:32.923
- They spin around, get lost.

445
00:42:33.007 --> 00:42:35.965
350 million years of
navigating gone haywire.


446
00:42:36.048 --> 00:42:38.424
Monroe knew this.

447
00:42:38.507 --> 00:42:39.382
He tracked with bugs.

448
00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:43.590
- Okay, so why cybernetic?

449
00:42:45.048 --> 00:42:47.549
- Somehow this Dropa figured
this out


450
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.257
and knew Monroe's methods.

451
00:42:50.424 --> 00:42:52.507
He found a way to throw
him off long enough


452
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.382
to let his guard down.

453
00:42:54.465 --> 00:42:58.715
- So, this Dropa is hunting us?

454
00:42:59.965 --> 00:43:01.382
- Monroe anyway.

455
00:43:01.965 --> 00:43:04.257
And maybe all of us.

456
00:43:06.507 --> 00:43:08.549
There's one other thing.

457
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:16.132
The Adamov girl said something
odd to me last night.


458
00:43:17.424 --> 00:43:20.881
She said the Russian had
a message for Monroe.


459
00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:21.840
- Yeah?

460
00:43:23.507 --> 00:43:25.756
- Said there was a
traitor among The Legion.


461
00:43:27.173 --> 00:43:29.048
Any idea what it's talking
about?


462
00:43:30.923 --> 00:43:31.923
- Look, why don't you go home,

463
00:43:32.007 --> 00:43:35.382
get some rest, take some
aspirin.


464
00:43:36.299 --> 00:43:38.173
Hell, take a whole lotta
aspirin.


465
00:43:38.923 --> 00:43:41.424
This Dropa knows we're onto it.

466
00:44:16.715 --> 00:44:19.756
-  Give up that easily?

467
00:44:20.756 --> 00:44:23.340
You've become... soft in your
retirement.


468
00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:35.590
- What are you doing here?

469
00:44:38.215 --> 00:44:39.881
It's been five years, Madison.

470
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.715
- I came back because someone
killed a member of our team.


471
00:44:45.798 --> 00:44:48.048
Judging by the looks
of you, I'm glad I did.


472
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:50.631
What happened?

473
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:53.465
- Retribution.

474
00:47:03.798 --> 00:47:04.507
- You look terrible.

475
00:47:20.673 --> 00:47:22.798
- I thought you might have left.

476
00:47:22.881 --> 00:47:24.923
-  Someone's
gotta keep an eye on you.


477
00:47:25.007 --> 00:47:27.424
- I'm fine.

478
00:47:30.424 --> 00:47:33.007
-  What's the next
move?


479
00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:37.881
- Heading out to
the country in the morning.


480
00:47:37.965 --> 00:47:39.215
-  What's out there?

481
00:47:39.299 --> 00:47:42.673
- Hopefully answers.

482
00:47:44.923 --> 00:47:45.798
Wanna come along?

483
00:47:46.424 --> 00:47:48.507
You could stay the night.

484
00:47:50.048 --> 00:47:51.756
No strings.

485
00:47:53.465 --> 00:47:54.881
- There never were with you.

486
00:47:59.048 --> 00:48:02.881
- So tell me what you've been
up to the last five years.


487
00:48:02.965 --> 00:48:03.715
- I'm gonna go.

488
00:48:03.798 --> 00:48:04.631
- Look, I...

489
00:48:06.965 --> 00:48:07.798
I just wanna talk.

490
00:48:09.673 --> 00:48:11.507
I could really use that right
now.


491
00:48:15.257 --> 00:48:18.132
- You better dry off first.

492
00:48:42.756 --> 00:48:42.798
- Eva?

493
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.840
I wonder where she could be?

494
00:49:00.798 --> 00:49:04.424
Oh, I must have spent too
long at the shipyards.


495
00:49:07.132 --> 00:49:09.840
My beautiful little
girl must have grown up


496
00:49:11.173 --> 00:49:11.631
and moved away.

497
00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.257
What am I going to do?

498
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:30.673
If only she had come to say
goodbye.


499
00:49:38.382 --> 00:49:40.299
I miss her so much.

500
00:49:48.215 --> 00:49:49.923
Oh!

501
00:49:51.257 --> 00:49:51.923
Muah!

502
00:49:52.007 --> 00:49:53.965
You are hiding the whole time.

503
00:49:54.048 --> 00:49:55.465
I knew it.

504
00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:32.798
- So what happened?

505
00:50:35.798 --> 00:50:40.798
- Well, after The Party

506
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:45.382
disbanded The Legion, what else
was there?


507
00:50:46.382 --> 00:50:48.881
You know we were nothing more
than an embarrassing secret


508
00:50:48.965 --> 00:50:51.048
that just needed to go away.

509
00:50:53.132 --> 00:50:57.965
Taft, Carter, Monroe
stayed.


510
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:02.549
I was out, moving on and you
were a wreck.


511
00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:07.673
Guess if I was living in
your skin at the same time


512
00:51:07.756 --> 00:51:09.090
I'd be the same way.

513
00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:21.340
Arthur took off to the colony.

514
00:51:22.631 --> 00:51:25.673
It was his time and he wanted
to leave everything behind.


515
00:51:29.673 --> 00:51:31.673
- So what happened to Jackson
out there?


516
00:51:34.173 --> 00:51:37.756
- I guess she just
couldn't handle it anymore.


517
00:51:42.007 --> 00:51:43.631
I don't know.

518
00:51:43.631 --> 00:51:46.132
She was on cleanup with me.

519
00:51:49.382 --> 00:51:53.465
It was either us or them
with the Dropa Resistance.


520
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:59.965
We understood that but the
families,


521
00:52:01.673 --> 00:52:02.840
that was different.

522
00:52:05.881 --> 00:52:08.007
A few months later
Monroe brought in Jackson


523
00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.756
to head up the final sweep
of the containment camps.


524
00:52:13.923 --> 00:52:17.923
The Party wanted it
finished fast and clean.


525
00:52:21.715 --> 00:52:26.257
They poisoned the Dropa water
supply with a DDT derivative.


526
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:33.590
It only killed the children.

527
00:53:28.923 --> 00:53:29.007
Two months later

528
00:53:31.923 --> 00:53:33.881
I found her dead in a motel room

529
00:53:33.965 --> 00:53:37.007
outside of Waco, gun still in
her mouth.


530
00:53:40.965 --> 00:53:43.340
- Jackson may have been the only
one of us


531
00:53:43.424 --> 00:53:44.631
with a conscience.

532
00:53:47.048 --> 00:53:47.090
- Yeah.

533
00:53:49.132 --> 00:53:50.840
And look where that got her.

534
00:53:58.631 --> 00:53:59.840
Still not over her?

535
00:54:02.465 --> 00:54:04.590
Out of all of us you had
the most reason to hate 'em


536
00:54:04.673 --> 00:54:06.881
after what she did.

537
00:54:06.965 --> 00:54:08.007
- That's enough.

538
00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:08.756
- She betrayed you.

539
00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.881
- I said that's enough.

540
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.631
Kate's in the past.

541
00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.507
- Do you really wanna
know what I've been doing


542
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:20.048
for the past five years?

543
00:54:23.798 --> 00:54:25.048
Trying to find reasons to stay
away.


544
00:54:26.798 --> 00:54:29.881
I never lost faith in you,
Harry.


545
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:34.715
- Faith is for the weak.

546
00:55:03.798 --> 00:55:05.590
-  Thank you,
mister--


547
00:55:05.673 --> 00:55:07.965
-  Monroe.

548
00:55:08.048 --> 00:55:09.715
-  Monroe.

549
00:56:22.673 --> 00:56:25.923
-  Come back to me.

550
00:56:44.382 --> 00:56:46.798
-  Over seven million
hits on the CityCam network.


551
00:56:46.881 --> 00:56:49.340
I thought you said it was
cleared.


552
00:56:49.424 --> 00:56:51.590
-  We cut the
feed as quick as we could.


553
00:56:51.673 --> 00:56:54.090
I told you not to get Harrison
involved.


554
00:56:54.173 --> 00:56:55.798
He's dangerous.

555
00:56:55.881 --> 00:56:58.465
- There's no one better for this
job.


556
00:56:58.549 --> 00:57:02.424
- Maybe, but he changed
since the accident.


557
00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.715
I'm not sure where his
loyalties lie anymore.


558
00:57:06.798 --> 00:57:08.382
-  Listen, Harry moves
fast.


559
00:57:08.465 --> 00:57:10.257
He'll find this Dropa.

560
00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:10.756
-  He's unpredictable.

561
00:58:08.382 --> 00:58:10.965
-  You're not alone.

562
00:58:11.048 --> 00:58:13.173
Death is not the end.

563
00:58:16.465 --> 00:58:17.965
Death is just another road,

564
00:58:18.631 --> 00:58:20.881
the road in life.

565
00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:26.257
And your soul is the guide.

566
00:58:50.965 --> 00:58:54.340
This is not over, Monroe.

567
00:59:54.965 --> 00:59:55.840
- Arthur?

568
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:33.215
- Want some?

569
01:02:17.215 --> 01:02:19.048
- What made you come back?

570
01:02:21.507 --> 01:02:25.840
- It's quieter here, less
distractions, you know.


571
01:02:28.673 --> 01:02:30.215
- I don't know about that
Arthur.


572
01:02:30.299 --> 01:02:32.340
You wanted outta here pretty bad

573
01:02:32.424 --> 01:02:34.007
after your time in The Legion.

574
01:02:35.132 --> 01:02:35.590
- That's what I thought, too.

575
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.507
But it's worse up there.

576
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:43.424
You know they're considering
complete isolationism.


577
01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:47.673
No, the Colony's no place
for someone like me.


578
01:02:53.215 --> 01:02:54.965
- Seems kinda isolated here.

579
01:02:56.923 --> 01:02:58.048
- It's simpler.

580
01:03:00.215 --> 01:03:02.715
- Yeah, I can see that.

581
01:03:08.507 --> 01:03:12.257
- So, I take it this isn't a
social visit.


582
01:03:14.215 --> 01:03:14.923
- No.

583
01:03:15.007 --> 01:03:17.715
-  Good.

584
01:03:17.798 --> 01:03:18.923
Let's keep it that way.

585
01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.090
Business then?

586
01:03:24.923 --> 01:03:26.132
- Dropa hunt.

587
01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:54.048
-  Who dragged you into
this?


588
01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:56.507
-  Taft.

589
01:03:58.257 --> 01:04:00.549
-  You just can't
say no to that sumbitch.


590
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:04.007
-  It could've
been any of us in that bar


591
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.340
couple of nights ago.

592
01:04:06.007 --> 01:04:07.673
- But it wasn't.

593
01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.257
-  Yeah, maybe so,
but that doesn't change things.


594
01:04:14.048 --> 01:04:16.798
- Your loyalty's gonna
put you in a body bag.


595
01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:25.756
- This Dropa is not like the
others.


596
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:31.923
They're usually runners not
killers.


597
01:04:33.923 --> 01:04:35.923
- We knew this was gonna come
back on us.


598
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:38.881
We should've finished 'em
off when we had the chance.


599
01:04:38.965 --> 01:04:41.507
-  There were other
options for dealing with them


600
01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:44.507
but The Party chose the easiest
way out.


601
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.673
-  There's a lot
you still don't know.


602
01:04:49.382 --> 01:04:51.631
- Maybe it's time you told me.

603
01:04:54.173 --> 01:04:56.132
- Let's go out back.

604
01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:29.756
- Why did it come after you?

605
01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.465
We really did it, didn't we
Monroe?


606
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:55.631
We took it all back from
those greedy bastards.


607
01:05:59.007 --> 01:06:01.840
Everybody thought we were heroes
then.


608
01:06:44.382 --> 01:06:47.090
- Back in 2004 we found a stone
disc


609
01:06:47.173 --> 01:06:51.756
washed ashore near Rockport
along with several cocoons.


610
01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:58.132
The discs told the story of
the Dropas in hieroglyphics.


611
01:06:58.215 --> 01:06:59.631
And then there was this one.

612
01:07:01.715 --> 01:07:03.382
You see any pattern in all that?

613
01:07:04.299 --> 01:07:05.965
- Not really.

614
01:07:07.756 --> 01:07:09.549
- There are recognizable forms.

615
01:07:10.465 --> 01:07:12.048
- Recognizable?

616
01:07:12.132 --> 01:07:13.048
- Symbolic.

617
01:07:14.756 --> 01:07:15.715
Very stylized.

618
01:07:18.715 --> 01:07:23.007
This first one, the oval, is a
cocoon.


619
01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:26.923
And this?

620
01:07:29.631 --> 01:07:34.631
- I suppose it's... first
phase Dropa metamorphosis?


621
01:07:34.881 --> 01:07:34.923
- Yes.

622
01:07:36.756 --> 01:07:38.507
And next a human form.

623
01:07:40.382 --> 01:07:42.382
And then this.

624
01:07:46.631 --> 01:07:48.048
- What's that?

625
01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:50.840
- It's what your hunting.

626
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.132
- Who else knew?

627
01:08:32.215 --> 01:08:34.382
- Other than the need-to-know
personnel in The Party


628
01:08:34.465 --> 01:08:36.631
only Taft, Carter, and me.

629
01:08:38.673 --> 01:08:41.173
I suspect Monroe would've
found out sometime later.


630
01:08:42.715 --> 01:08:43.965
It was tight-lipped.

631
01:08:44.048 --> 01:08:48.507
You have no idea how
much worldwide hysteria


632
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:49.673
it would've caused.

633
01:08:52.715 --> 01:08:54.881
Even more than the virus.

634
01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:59.007
- What do you mean even
more than the virus?


635
01:09:00.715 --> 01:09:02.173
- It was all a cover Harry.

636
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:10.756
The virus was spread
through the atmosphere


637
01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.590
in small, controlled amounts,

638
01:09:14.048 --> 01:09:16.507
in geographically specific
locations.


639
01:09:18.424 --> 01:09:20.715
The same pattern as the Dropa
migration.


640
01:09:22.048 --> 01:09:24.756
The virus was nothing
more than a mutated strain


641
01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.007
of a viral hemorrhagic fever.

642
01:09:28.549 --> 01:09:30.590
There was nothing alien about
it.


643
01:09:30.673 --> 01:09:32.340
We manufactured the bug to
create


644
01:09:32.424 --> 01:09:33.507
just enough fear to--

645
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.715
- Just enough fear?

646
01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:39.382
I knew people who died from that
virus.


647
01:09:39.465 --> 01:09:41.507
- We all did.

648
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:42.881
Calculated risk unfortunately.

649
01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:46.465
If one of those things got out--

650
01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:49.631
- It would've killed
over 20 million people


651
01:09:49.715 --> 01:09:50.965
like the virus?

652
01:09:51.048 --> 01:09:52.048
That's controllable, measurable?

653
01:09:54.257 --> 01:09:56.715
Who decides who lives and who
dies?


654
01:09:56.798 --> 01:09:57.881
- The Dropas were a potential
threat.


655
01:10:00.048 --> 01:10:02.173
We just had to disguise the
reason why


656
01:10:02.257 --> 01:10:06.090
and use it to create
unity, unity in The Party.


657
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:10.507
- We committed genocide.

658
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:11.465
- No.

659
01:10:12.631 --> 01:10:14.299
Genocide is for humans.

660
01:10:15.923 --> 01:10:19.048
I preferred... extinction.

661
01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:23.965
It was them or us.

662
01:10:24.048 --> 01:10:26.881
Now, I don't know about
you but I prefer to be


663
01:10:26.965 --> 01:10:28.715
on the us side of the equation.

664
01:10:28.798 --> 01:10:31.007
- I was referring to humans.

665
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.132
- We're just pawns.

666
01:10:35.549 --> 01:10:38.798
It's always been that way.

667
01:10:39.798 --> 01:10:40.965
You've been around long
enough to know that.


668
01:10:43.715 --> 01:10:45.299
- It's time things changed.

669
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:57.840
- It's not so easy when
the prey fights back,


670
01:10:57.923 --> 01:10:59.257
is it old man?

671
01:11:04.631 --> 01:11:05.048
- How's that for easy?

672
01:11:14.507 --> 01:11:15.923
- What are you doing?

673
01:11:16.007 --> 01:11:17.340
- Why did you come back?

674
01:11:25.673 --> 01:11:28.132
Or maybe you didn't.

675
01:12:32.132 --> 01:12:33.340
- Wakey, wakey.

676
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:37.507
- Oh no.

677
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:39.631
- Oh yes.

678
01:12:40.382 --> 01:12:43.090
- Well, this is embarrassing.

679
01:12:45.673 --> 01:12:46.840
- Where's Arthur?

680
01:12:46.923 --> 01:12:48.257
- It's still me, Harry.

681
01:12:49.257 --> 01:12:52.090
It's just a synth body, an
android.


682
01:12:54.299 --> 01:12:55.340
We're bio-linked.

683
01:12:58.173 --> 01:12:59.465
I wasn't safe down there.

684
01:13:00.715 --> 01:13:03.132
I'm better off in the Colony,
least for the time being.


685
01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.424
I hope you understand.

686
01:13:09.798 --> 01:13:12.173
- I don't know what to believe.

687
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:20.048
- You still don't realize what
we were dealing with here.


688
01:13:20.132 --> 01:13:22.590
The longer it's out there, the
less chance


689
01:13:22.673 --> 01:13:23.173
you'll be able to stop it.

690
01:13:25.048 --> 01:13:25.715
- How am I supposed to kill
something


691
01:13:25.798 --> 01:13:28.173
that constantly evolves?

692
01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.173
- Taft picked you for a reason.

693
01:13:33.465 --> 01:13:36.631
You understand the Dropas.

694
01:13:38.965 --> 01:13:40.424
- If that's an off-handed
reference to Kate


695
01:13:40.507 --> 01:13:41.090
then leave her out of this.

696
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:44.340
- Oh, I didn't mean it like
that.


697
01:13:46.798 --> 01:13:48.756
No one blames you.

698
01:13:50.507 --> 01:13:51.840
She fooled all of us.

699
01:13:54.382 --> 01:13:55.257
I've never seen a Dropa

700
01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.923
with such complete
human genetic synthesis.


701
01:14:02.507 --> 01:14:03.424
Kate was unique.

702
01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:06.965
She had a great ass too.

703
01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:12.257
-  Don't mention her
again.


704
01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:18.798
- A little levity is needed
here, don't you think?


705
01:14:19.507 --> 01:14:22.257
Helps us keep a level head.

706
01:14:25.215 --> 01:14:28.299
Besides, this thing is
much bigger than you or me.


707
01:14:32.132 --> 01:14:34.507
- The girl I questioned about
Monroe


708
01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:35.965
said the exact same thing.

709
01:14:36.048 --> 01:14:37.173
-  Sure she did.

710
01:14:37.257 --> 01:14:39.132
-  What are you
telling me?


711
01:14:39.215 --> 01:14:43.299
- Yelena
Adamov.


712
01:14:44.923 --> 01:14:48.299
The Party had me work an
angle on her for six months.


713
01:14:48.382 --> 01:14:50.798
She didn't know what her
real role was anyway.


714
01:14:50.881 --> 01:14:52.173
She just kept on fighting the
good fight.


715
01:14:53.881 --> 01:14:56.465
- She was a part of all this?

716
01:14:58.631 --> 01:14:59.965
- Wakey, wakey.

717
01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:04.631
- And you set up Monroe.

718
01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:08.965
-  A miscalculation.

719
01:15:09.715 --> 01:15:10.756
- Miscalculation?

720
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.382
- The Dropa was the target.

721
01:15:14.299 --> 01:15:15.715
Just didn't go as planned.

722
01:15:18.215 --> 01:15:21.173
Didn't know what we were dealing
with until it was too late.


723
01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:23.382
Shame too.

724
01:15:25.756 --> 01:15:27.257
I always liked Monroe.

725
01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.257
- Yeah, I can tell you're
all broken up about it.


726
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:34.549
- More than you know.

727
01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.881
It took us six months
to set this thing up.


728
01:15:37.923 --> 01:15:41.507
You have no idea how to
make things so covert.


729
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:43.048
We had to keep quiet.

730
01:15:44.715 --> 01:15:47.840
Even Taft was kept in the
dark about most of it.


731
01:15:47.923 --> 01:15:49.465
- And you played both of us.

732
01:15:50.507 --> 01:15:52.715
-  I had no
intention of bringing you in.


733
01:15:53.673 --> 01:15:54.798
That was Taft.

734
01:15:56.507 --> 01:15:56.549
- And Yelena?

735
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:05.465
- I had to uh... quiet her.

736
01:16:05.549 --> 01:16:07.507
- If the Dropas presented
this much of a threat


737
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:09.424
why didn't we just finish them
off?


738
01:16:09.507 --> 01:16:11.215
- If it were up to me, I
would've finished


739
01:16:11.299 --> 01:16:12.340
what we started.

740
01:16:13.798 --> 01:16:17.090
But the females didn't pose a
threat.


741
01:16:17.965 --> 01:16:20.631
It was the two bull males.

742
01:16:23.007 --> 01:16:24.881
We needed their genetic codes.

743
01:16:27.631 --> 01:16:29.465
Stepwise
Evolution.


744
01:16:31.132 --> 01:16:33.340
That's what the scientists
back East called it.


745
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.215
- Stepwise Evolution?

746
01:16:36.299 --> 01:16:37.424
-  Well, something about
adding


747
01:16:37.507 --> 01:16:40.090
additional Dropa amino acids
to the human genetic code.


748
01:16:40.173 --> 01:16:41.007
- Jesus.

749
01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:46.215
- Dropas have incredible
regenerative qualities.


750
01:16:46.299 --> 01:16:49.673
-  Where is the other
male?


751
01:16:49.756 --> 01:16:50.507
-  Tagged.

752
01:16:52.549 --> 01:16:52.881
He's dormant.

753
01:16:52.965 --> 01:16:54.507
- Dormant?

754
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:56.382
Was this one dormant?

755
01:16:56.465 --> 01:16:56.507
- Yes.

756
01:16:58.465 --> 01:17:00.756
Until he figured out how
to remove his tracer.


757
01:17:03.132 --> 01:17:05.631
But the other male is not a
threat.


758
01:17:05.715 --> 01:17:06.590
- Yet.

759
01:17:08.549 --> 01:17:08.590
- Harry.

760
01:17:10.382 --> 01:17:14.048
What do you remember after the
accident?


761
01:17:15.549 --> 01:17:17.257
What about all those months you
spent


762
01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:18.756
at the clinic with Kate?

763
01:17:33.756 --> 01:17:35.340
- Leave Kate out of this.

764
01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:07.215
What's
that?


765
01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:12.007
It's what you're hunting.

766
01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.715
- I wish Mommy was still with
us.


767
01:18:33.798 --> 01:18:38.631
- Oh, my solnyshko.

768
01:18:40.465 --> 01:18:41.465
We will be fine.

769
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.090
And I will never let
anything happen to you.


770
01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.215
-  Where have you been?

771
01:19:02.299 --> 01:19:04.673
-  Working a lead.

772
01:19:04.756 --> 01:19:05.382
- Taft's dead.

773
01:19:05.465 --> 01:19:08.299
This thing knows how to find us.

774
01:19:08.382 --> 01:19:10.590
The coroner's report from
Monroe's attack


775
01:19:10.673 --> 01:19:12.881
found small traces of liquid
disprosium.


776
01:19:12.965 --> 01:19:14.965
- Disprosium?

777
01:19:15.048 --> 01:19:16.048
- It's an element that was
used in fusion reactors


778
01:19:16.132 --> 01:19:18.590
prior to balthorium.

779
01:19:18.673 --> 01:19:20.465
Outdated now and rarely used.

780
01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:24.048
The data scan found one regional
location


781
01:19:24.132 --> 01:19:25.132
where it's stored.

782
01:19:26.465 --> 01:19:27.090
It's a warehouse in the ship
channel.


783
01:19:27.173 --> 01:19:28.090
I'm gonna check it out.

784
01:19:28.173 --> 01:19:29.048
-  I'll go with you.

785
01:19:29.132 --> 01:19:30.215
-  I'm on it.

786
01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:32.132
- Just wait until I get there.

787
01:19:32.215 --> 01:19:33.299
-  No time for that.

788
01:19:33.382 --> 01:19:34.756
- You don't know what you're
dealing with.


789
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.215
This could get ugly real fast.

790
01:19:36.299 --> 01:19:38.007
-  I know what
I'm dealing with Harrison.


791
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:40.299
The question is do you?

792
01:20:05.507 --> 01:20:06.756
- Oh.

793
01:20:07.923 --> 01:20:08.798
Oh.

794
01:20:14.715 --> 01:20:16.382
You okay?

795
01:20:16.382 --> 01:20:17.299
- What's wrong?

796
01:20:19.549 --> 01:20:20.424
- Taft's dead.

797
01:20:22.798 --> 01:20:22.840
I was worried.

798
01:20:24.382 --> 01:20:25.715
C.O.N.T.A.G. tried to locate you
on RFID.


799
01:20:27.673 --> 01:20:28.590
- I know how to handle myself.

800
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:32.673
I removed the sensor years ago
Harry.


801
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.299
- It's not safe here.

802
01:20:35.382 --> 01:20:37.132
You need to get outta the city.

803
01:20:37.215 --> 01:20:37.881
I have to find Carter.

804
01:20:37.965 --> 01:20:39.215
She has a lead on this Dropa.

805
01:20:39.299 --> 01:20:40.257
- I'm gonna go with you.

806
01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.007
- Not this time.

807
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:42.257
Things are different.
- No!


808
01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.173
You don't need to do this.

809
01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:45.965
Okay, just walk away.

810
01:20:46.048 --> 01:20:48.007
Let Carter deal with it.

811
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:49.257
- Taft brought me into this for
a reason.


812
01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.673
- You have no loyalty to him.

813
01:20:52.756 --> 01:20:55.424
- He's the reason I'm still
breathing.


814
01:20:55.507 --> 01:20:58.965
- You're alive because you
didn't give up.


815
01:20:59.048 --> 01:21:00.673
- Not giving up didn't save me.

816
01:21:01.549 --> 01:21:05.715
Between Taft and Kate, I owe
them.


817
01:21:05.798 --> 01:21:07.507
- You owe them nothing.

818
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.299
You gave everything to The
Legion


819
01:21:10.382 --> 01:21:14.048
and Taft repaid you by what,
putting you back out there?


820
01:21:14.132 --> 01:21:14.715
And Kate?

821
01:21:15.881 --> 01:21:17.840
Really?

822
01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:22.590
You need to understand who
really cares about you.


823
01:21:31.090 --> 01:21:34.340
Open your eyes.

824
01:21:45.424 --> 01:21:48.257
What are you so afraid of?

825
01:21:49.965 --> 01:21:50.840
- Nothing.

826
01:22:27.299 --> 01:22:29.840
-  Harry, she's
gone.


827
01:23:10.798 --> 01:23:15.132
- C.O.N.T.A.G., give me
a report on warehouses


828
01:23:15.215 --> 01:23:18.340
in the ship channel, reference
disporsium.


829
01:23:21.965 --> 01:23:23.631
-  One warehouse
matching


830
01:23:23.715 --> 01:23:25.881
export records for disprosium.

831
01:23:25.965 --> 01:23:28.299
Location in Fallout Zone 12.

832
01:23:29.132 --> 01:23:33.923
Potential for rad absorption
levels, 200 to 300 units.


833
01:26:48.173 --> 01:26:51.173
- What kind of man are you?

834
01:26:52.007 --> 01:26:53.340
- The killing kind.

835
01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:25.048
- Come back to me.

836
01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.465
-  What scares you?

837
01:27:59.965 --> 01:28:05.007
Perhaps, not knowing who you
are.


838
01:28:07.756 --> 01:28:08.881
- You don't know me.

839
01:28:12.756 --> 01:28:16.798
- You were trained for war.

840
01:28:17.549 --> 01:28:21.590
Mankind's gift to the universe.

841
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.507
And you're fighting for what?

842
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:29.465
Nothing.

843
01:28:30.465 --> 01:28:32.090
But you,

844
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.340
you might be

845
01:28:39.424 --> 01:28:41.590
different now.

846
01:28:42.715 --> 01:28:43.590
- Different?

847
01:28:44.965 --> 01:28:46.132
- Yes.

848
01:28:47.507 --> 01:28:51.048
I am... different.

849
01:28:51.965 --> 01:28:53.424
Would you like to see?

850
01:29:17.923 --> 01:29:21.673
Now, do you see?

851
01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:25.965
The Legion has taken everything
from me.


852
01:29:27.881 --> 01:29:32.090
And now all that is left is this
hate.


853
01:29:32.715 --> 01:29:37.340
Just like a human.

854
01:29:39.048 --> 01:29:40.257
- You're not human.

855
01:29:41.965 --> 01:29:45.215
- No.

856
01:29:46.173 --> 01:29:48.299
I am

857
01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:52.715
so much more.

858
01:29:58.007 --> 01:30:00.215
Have you ever lost someone?

859
01:30:01.923 --> 01:30:04.549
Then you know what it's like.

860
01:30:06.465 --> 01:30:07.798
-  What, pain?

861
01:30:09.173 --> 01:30:09.215
- No.

862
01:30:10.631 --> 01:30:12.965
Pain is easy

863
01:30:13.048 --> 01:30:17.173
to control, to hide.

864
01:30:21.965 --> 01:30:26.090
Revenge, that is

865
01:30:26.173 --> 01:30:27.590
not so easy.

866
01:30:30.173 --> 01:30:34.715
You are here to kill me
to avenge their deaths.


867
01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:38.173
But part of you does not want to
do it.


868
01:30:39.507 --> 01:30:40.382
Why?

869
01:30:42.631 --> 01:30:45.549
Perhaps it is because I am more
like you


870
01:30:46.173 --> 01:30:50.756
and you are more like...

871
01:31:10.881 --> 01:31:12.881
That's it, little man.

872
01:31:13.923 --> 01:31:17.507
Become that which you hunt.

873
01:31:23.715 --> 01:31:25.382
- That's it.

874
01:31:26.382 --> 01:31:27.965
Keep coming.

875
01:31:28.048 --> 01:31:28.881
Come on.

876
01:32:35.132 --> 01:32:38.798
- You cannot run away from who
you are.


877
01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:41.590
- Who's running?

878
01:34:40.215 --> 01:34:41.590
- Told you someone's
gonna keep an eye on you.


879
01:35:47.798 --> 01:35:49.715
-  What do you
remember


880
01:35:49.798 --> 01:35:51.132
after the accident?

881
01:35:51.215 --> 01:35:52.549
What about all those months you
spent


882
01:35:52.631 --> 01:35:54.007
at the clinic with Kate?

883
01:35:55.215 --> 01:35:57.507
When this is done,

884
01:35:57.590 --> 01:36:02.340
whatever it is, my advice is
for you to leave the city.


885
01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:05.299
-  There's
a traitor in The Legion.


886
01:36:05.382 --> 01:36:08.382
-  What
scares you?


887
01:36:08.465 --> 01:36:12.673
Perhaps, not knowing who you
are.


888
01:36:25.756 --> 01:36:28.881
-  Open your
eyes.
