1
00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:34.611
Oh my God!

2
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.685
Got a white male, 28,

3
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.523
he's sustained 37 stab wounds,
mainly to the chest, neck,


4
00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:47.624
but also the torso, and pelvis.

5
00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:49.560
Not one witness.

6
00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:51.925
We got a whole
fucking bloodbath,


7
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.157
and not one damned witness?

8
00:00:53.526 --> 00:00:55.126
I guess this is their MO?

9
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.128
Who knows?

10
00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:02.540
All right, I've seen enough.
Cover him up.


11
00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:07.006
The Mayor arrived.

12
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.239
So, you see, we all birds,
but the difference between


13
00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:12.143
me and the Sheriff?
He a pigeon and I'm an eagle.


14
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.488
I don't want wanna
hear excuses, I want answers.


15
00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:17.797
We're doing everything
we can to get answers


16
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.952
for you ASAP.

17
00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:22.725
Look, you think this connected
to the other two murders?


18
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.254
You have any suspects,
a witness?


19
00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.124
There is a possible connection,

20
00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.104
and we don't have an answer
for all other questions yet,


21
00:01:28.128 --> 00:01:30.260
but we have some
of our top agents on it now.


22
00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:32.031
E... excuse me, sir.

23
00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:34.704
Here's what I do know,

24
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:36.739
that this is not
a good look for you,


25
00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:38.054
the sheriff's department, or me.

26
00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.238
This, this was intentional, yo.

27
00:01:41.273 --> 00:01:42.877
Definitely not an accident.

28
00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:45.110
Look, I'm the best
man this city ever had,


29
00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:46.683
and the best you ever had.

30
00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:48.080
Wow.

31
00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:49.851
I need you to get
with my publicist,


32
00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:51.149
come up with something.

33
00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:53.657
Any sign of domestic abuse?
Drugs?


34
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.055
I need everybody
to keep combing.


35
00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:00.224
What do you think now?

36
00:02:01.095 --> 00:02:02.193
Follow me.

37
00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:12.104
Hm. Anything else?

38
00:02:12.773 --> 00:02:15.877
Aw. You can't take it, can you?

39
00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.364
You know, that's probably
why we lasted just one date.


40
00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:22.884
No, we had one date because
you couldn't play your role,


41
00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.084
that's why you didn't
end up in the office, but...


42
00:02:25.352 --> 00:02:27.317
Okay, boys and girls,
let's wrap this up,


43
00:02:27.352 --> 00:02:29.022
before the media
have a field day.


44
00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.760
Okay, listen,
Sheriff Stance already


45
00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:31.992
has a search on hand.

46
00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.169
So what we gonna do is go to...

47
00:02:33.193 --> 00:02:34.533
Sheriff Stance.

48
00:02:35.502 --> 00:02:37.998
Lee, what the hell do you want
me to put in the report?


49
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.165
Say he was
dancing and he slipped.


50
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.738
Fucking serious?

51
00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:43.113
All right, look, I don't
know what you wanna do,


52
00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:44.301
Sheriff, but guess what?

53
00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:45.742
I need arrests,
and I need it now.


54
00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:47.843
No, I want you to solve this.

55
00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.747
You just got that big,
pretty house. And guess what?


56
00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:53.079
If you don't solve this,
I'm going to fire you,


57
00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:54.883
and the whole
sheriff department.


58
00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:59.250
All right, guys, we got
one hour to wrap this up.


59
00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.320
Okay, you heard him.

60
00:04:19.398 --> 00:04:21.398
Oh my God, please don't hurt me!

61
00:04:21.433 --> 00:04:24.709
Don't hurt me!

62
00:05:27.972 --> 00:05:29.452
Come on, buddy.

63
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.040
You did this once,
you can do it again.


64
00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:40.048
All right?

65
00:05:59.971 --> 00:06:01.432
Hey, babe!

66
00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:03.368
Hey, pumpkin patch.

67
00:06:04.943 --> 00:06:06.503
How are you doing?

68
00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:09.374
Look at you in that dress
and those shoes and that face.


69
00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.079
- Come here.
- Aw.


70
00:06:11.114 --> 00:06:13.081
Come here.

71
00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:15.347
How's things going at
the, uh, at the boutique?


72
00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:18.790
Good. Yeah. I got
the mannequins in today.


73
00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:20.121
Oh, yeah?

74
00:06:20.156 --> 00:06:21.532
I'm still waiting
on the display tables,


75
00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:23.828
and the handyman
needs to fix the bathrooms.


76
00:06:24.996 --> 00:06:26.831
Oh, yeah. Speaking of handymen.

77
00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:29.213
- Did you fix the door?
- I didn't fix the door.


78
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.198
You really need
to fix this door.


79
00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:35.004
Attagirl!

80
00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:37.171
Thanks. How'd
the writing go today?


81
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.340
Good, good. Yeah, uh,
I think I made a breakthrough.


82
00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:43.848
Great. I can't wait to read it.

83
00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:53.924
Um, uh, whose turn
is it to do dishes?


84
00:06:54.293 --> 00:06:55.354
I got 'em.

85
00:06:56.056 --> 00:06:58.489
Good. I'm gonna
get some afternoon sun.


86
00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:00.931
Okay.

87
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.094
I will stand by you.
I'll always pick you up.


88
00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.162
You were my new beginning.

89
00:07:34.197 --> 00:07:37.462
I cannot wait to spend
the rest of my life with you.


90
00:07:57.187 --> 00:07:58.351
Oh, sh...

91
00:07:58.653 --> 00:08:00.958
Oh! Sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.


92
00:08:01.226 --> 00:08:03.521
I just wanted
to tell you that I love you.


93
00:08:03.556 --> 00:08:04.929
I love you, too, baby.

94
00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:08.130
All right. Well,
I don't want to distract you.


95
00:08:08.165 --> 00:08:09.494
I'm going to go get ready.

96
00:08:09.696 --> 00:08:11.034
Okay.

97
00:08:18.571 --> 00:08:20.076
I'm so glad we're
having people over.


98
00:08:20.478 --> 00:08:21.946
I was beginning to feel

99
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:23.261
like we were
becoming my parents.


100
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.313
You think I'm your dad?

101
00:08:26.348 --> 00:08:27.677
That's pretty creepy, babe.

102
00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:30.581
No, I mean,
you know what I mean!


103
00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:32.336
We used to go out
with couples all the time.


104
00:08:32.588 --> 00:08:34.387
Now I'm so busy at the boutique,

105
00:08:34.622 --> 00:08:36.433
and you're constantly
in front of the computer,


106
00:08:36.457 --> 00:08:38.105
and at night we're
just come home and collapse.


107
00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:40.492
You know what?
Life is going to pass us by,


108
00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:42.131
and one day
we're going to wake up,


109
00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:43.366
and realize that we missed it.

110
00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:45.904
So tonight, let's just have fun.

111
00:08:48.337 --> 00:08:51.536
Deal? No talk about work.

112
00:08:52.737 --> 00:08:55.441
No. Can't argue
with you in that dress.


113
00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:02.118
So I got to ask, like,
whose idea was the bow tie?


114
00:09:02.153 --> 00:09:03.284
The matching?

115
00:09:04.386 --> 00:09:05.786
Who do you think?

116
00:09:06.018 --> 00:09:08.388
I am just so awful to these two.

117
00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.060
I don't know how
they put up with me.


118
00:09:10.095 --> 00:09:11.600
It's totally forgiven
as long as you don't have


119
00:09:11.624 --> 00:09:13.426
the matching Christmas
pictures with everyone


120
00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:15.098
in the same color,
you know what I mean?


121
00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:16.413
Actually, I was
thinking of that.


122
00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:19.366
How did you know, Michael?

123
00:09:19.568 --> 00:09:23.700
Reindeer sweaters for everyone.
So, a whole year?


124
00:09:24.102 --> 00:09:26.274
Yeah, a whole year.
Not a drop, man.


125
00:09:26.309 --> 00:09:29.277
- Not even cough syrup.
- Yeah. And, uh, that is next.


126
00:09:29.812 --> 00:09:32.643
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

127
00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.987
Now, you need to learn
to eat like a big boy already,


128
00:09:36.022 --> 00:09:37.681
because you are
a big boy, Mason.


129
00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:40.057
Oh, I'm sorry, Kat.
I'll help you clean this up.


130
00:09:40.092 --> 00:09:41.454
It's fine.

131
00:09:41.489 --> 00:09:43.209
Um, so, Michael,
tell us about the new book.


132
00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:44.963
We've heard so much about it.

133
00:09:47.495 --> 00:09:49.099
I got to tell you,
it's kicking my butt,


134
00:09:49.134 --> 00:09:50.529
but I'm trooping through.

135
00:09:50.898 --> 00:09:53.301
Good.
Well, I loved Knight Fire,


136
00:09:53.336 --> 00:09:58.009
so if you ever need anyone
to give this version a read,


137
00:09:58.044 --> 00:09:59.142
I'm your woman.

138
00:09:59.177 --> 00:10:00.704
Yeah. Good luck with that.

139
00:10:00.739 --> 00:10:02.112
He doesn't even let me read it.

140
00:10:02.147 --> 00:10:03.509
Yeah. Top secret. Mm hm.

141
00:10:03.544 --> 00:10:06.215
No way. It would
drive me absolutely nuts,


142
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.722
if Bill was working
on something this big


143
00:10:07.746 --> 00:10:09.746
- and kept it from me.
- Aw.


144
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:11.517
Well, I can't
wait till it's ready.


145
00:10:11.552 --> 00:10:14.091
She means it, she tells
all her friends she knows


146
00:10:14.126 --> 00:10:16.225
the guy who wrote
that Knight book, you know?


147
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.490
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.


148
00:10:17.525 --> 00:10:19.162
Oh. Thank you.

149
00:10:19.197 --> 00:10:20.636
Then she asks why
I can't be a writer.


150
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.264
You can be a writer, man.

151
00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:23.804
No, I don't know
the first thing about writing.


152
00:10:23.828 --> 00:10:25.641
I didn't know how to write
a book 'til I wrote a book.


153
00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:27.269
I still don't know
how to write a book.


154
00:10:27.304 --> 00:10:29.073
Make it up as you go along.

155
00:10:29.108 --> 00:10:31.108
So, is this new one
a continuation of the last one?


156
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.736
Kind of, same main characters.

157
00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:36.575
Oh, so question of the evening,
is the Knight coming back?


158
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.215
The Knight
is coming back, yes, yes.


159
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.547
Yay! He makes it so much fun.
What a great character.


160
00:10:41.582 --> 00:10:43.549
Thank you. Everybody
likes the Knight. Toast.


161
00:10:44.453 --> 00:10:45.551
- Toast.
- Sounds good.


162
00:10:45.886 --> 00:10:47.168
- To friendship.
- To friendship.


163
00:10:47.192 --> 00:10:48.488
Cheers.

164
00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.028
Cheers.

165
00:11:07.311 --> 00:11:08.607
I'd make a great mommy.

166
00:11:11.777 --> 00:11:13.447
Wouldn't
our daughter be adorable?


167
00:11:29.894 --> 00:11:31.212
Are you coming to bed?

168
00:11:31.236 --> 00:11:32.598
Coming.

169
00:12:25.653 --> 00:12:26.853
What are you doing?

170
00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:33.329
Uh I... I thought
I heard something.


171
00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:35.265
Did you set the alarm?

172
00:12:35.795 --> 00:12:36.860
Yeah.

173
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.501
God. I'm thinking
I'm hearing something.


174
00:12:41.103 --> 00:12:43.603
I keep having this dream
where something's whispering


175
00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:44.703
in my ear.

176
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:46.540
And I think I understand 'em.

177
00:12:46.775 --> 00:12:48.935
Then I wake up, and I have
no idea what they're saying.


178
00:12:49.281 --> 00:12:50.643
That's odd, huh?

179
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.646
Yeah, it's weird.

180
00:12:55.547 --> 00:12:57.551
Well, I'm off to bed.
Don't be long.


181
00:12:57.586 --> 00:12:58.849
Okay.

182
00:13:15.505 --> 00:13:19.936
So, when will you be
finished with your book?


183
00:13:20.873 --> 00:13:22.213
I don't know, baby.

184
00:13:22.648 --> 00:13:24.776
Uh, a month, just to
finish the first draft.


185
00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:26.679
And there's editors notes,

186
00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:29.451
and publisher's notes
and notes' notes, and...


187
00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:33.521
Yeah, it takes
forever to finish a book.


188
00:13:33.556 --> 00:13:34.621
Yeah. Tell me about it.

189
00:13:35.723 --> 00:13:37.228
I want to be Stephen King.

190
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.923
I wanna write, like 12 a week.

191
00:13:44.028 --> 00:13:45.797
That's nice.

192
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:53.673
Yeah, that feels really good.

193
00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:08.325
You are so beautiful.
You know that?


194
00:14:08.954 --> 00:14:10.756
You are so beautiful.

195
00:14:15.928 --> 00:14:18.830
I wanna feel you. Mm.

196
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:21.767
I want you inside me.

197
00:14:28.039 --> 00:14:30.479
- I wanna have your baby.
- What?


198
00:14:31.014 --> 00:14:32.580
Is that what this is about?

199
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.826
Can't you see
that that's what I want?


200
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.322
Can we not talk
about this right now?


201
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.457
When can we talk about it?

202
00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:43.292
We've... we've talked
about this, a 100 times.


203
00:14:45.463 --> 00:14:47.826
I... I'm almost 37 years old,
I mean, most of my friends


204
00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:49.993
are on their second
or third kid by now.


205
00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:55.504
I mean, every single day
that we wait is another day


206
00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:57.179
that we don't get
to spend with our child.


207
00:14:57.769 --> 00:15:01.411
Look, can
we just... have a little faith?


208
00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:04.909
Just let me finish my book!
That's all.


209
00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:06.284
Then we can talk about family.

210
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.584
That's what he said
about me opening my boutique.


211
00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:12.059
Yeah, what's the real reason?
Why are you pulling away?


212
00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:13.819
That's the real reason.

213
00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:15.568
I... I'm, I'm under pressure,
I want to finish my book.


214
00:15:15.592 --> 00:15:16.657
Fuck you!

215
00:15:16.992 --> 00:15:18.857
I know what
the real fucking reason is.


216
00:15:18.892 --> 00:15:20.052
Yeah. What's the real reason?

217
00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:21.827
You're not attracted to me.

218
00:15:22.396 --> 00:15:24.599
What do you... you
fucking want some 18 year old?


219
00:15:24.634 --> 00:15:26.612
You want some fucking,
stupid... fucking young chick?


220
00:15:26.636 --> 00:15:28.636
- Am I told old for you?
- Oh my... Oh my God.


221
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:30.605
Because then you can
just wait for 20 more years.


222
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.068
Why do you just
give me what I want?


223
00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:33.905
Good night.

224
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.049
You know, I thought,
after three years,


225
00:15:35.073 --> 00:15:36.710
you would've grown up.

226
00:16:38.906 --> 00:16:41.577
<i>Wednesday, 2:44 a.m.</i>

227
00:16:41.612 --> 00:16:42.776

229

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.117
<i>Remember me?</i>

231
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:03.896
All right. Okay. Okay.

232
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.952
Hello, old chap.
Long time, no see!


233
00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.823
I missed our tittle-tattles.

234
00:17:30.358 --> 00:17:33.926
Oh.
Trouble with the missus, eh?


235
00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:37.765
Not too worry,
belly up to the barmaid!


236
00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:39.228
Hah!

237
00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:10.286
Cheers, to one year
of sobriety, and many more.


238
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:11.881
Couldn't have done
it without you, baby.


239
00:19:14.259 --> 00:19:17.161
Look, I'm... I'm really
sorry about the other night.


240
00:19:17.463 --> 00:19:19.801
It's just seeing
Bill and Mary's son...


241
00:19:19.836 --> 00:19:20.868
Hey, stop.

242
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.706
I would probably be dead,
or in the gutter,


243
00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:25.037
if you hadn't have dried me out.

244
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.777
So as far as I'm concerned,
there isn't an 18 year old


245
00:19:28.812 --> 00:19:30.372
in the world
that could take your place.


246
00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:45.024
Ugh, can you get that?

247
00:19:57.269 --> 00:19:58.334
Hello.

248
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.305
Hello?

249
00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:15.659
You have any
idea what time it is?


250
00:20:15.694 --> 00:20:17.054
<i>Remember me?</i>

251
00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.696
Who is this?

252
00:20:19.731 --> 00:20:20.928
<i>Remember me?</i>

253
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:23.161
Who is this?

254
00:20:39.245 --> 00:20:40.310
Who was it?

255
00:20:40.578 --> 00:20:41.982
Wrong number.

256
00:20:45.922 --> 00:20:47.350
<i>Remember me?</i>

257
00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:48.934
<i>End of messages.</i>

258
00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:50.287
Any idea who it could be?

259
00:20:50.322 --> 00:20:51.431
No. Same as the other night.

260
00:20:51.455 --> 00:20:52.762
But it was a woman's voice.

261
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.192
That's weird.

262
00:20:54.227 --> 00:20:55.303
You don't recognize it either?

263
00:20:55.327 --> 00:20:56.667
Nope.

264
00:20:57.036 --> 00:20:58.973
Yeah, it's probably just
some kids fooling around.


265
00:20:58.997 --> 00:21:01.199
Well, hopefully
they'll get a life.


266
00:21:01.234 --> 00:21:03.300
I have a hard enough
time sleeping as it is.


267
00:21:04.369 --> 00:21:05.676
Love you.

268
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.275
Hi, Mitch!

269
00:21:36.775 --> 00:21:38.302
I'm one year sober,
as of yesterday.


270
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:47.784
It's one day at a time, man.

271
00:21:51.757 --> 00:21:53.119
Um, alcohol is a disease.

272
00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:56.892
And I tried to convince
myself and everybody else,


273
00:21:57.394 --> 00:22:01.061
that um, I could beat
that disease on my own,


274
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.801
and I... I could for
a little while, you know,


275
00:22:04.836 --> 00:22:06.231
like a day or two.

276
00:22:09.475 --> 00:22:11.742
But it took someone
who loved me more than I love


277
00:22:11.777 --> 00:22:15.207
the bottle to shake
me out of it, you know,


278
00:22:15.242 --> 00:22:17.176
to show me what it was
that I was throwing away.


279
00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:18.914
And she saved my life
because she forced me


280
00:22:18.949 --> 00:22:21.378
to come to these meetings,
or she'd leave me.


281
00:22:23.547 --> 00:22:25.514
And this is someone
who stuck by me,


282
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:28.957
after I had
a debilitating accident,


283
00:22:28.992 --> 00:22:30.761
a week after I met her.

284
00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:36.459
I knew that if my
disease was pushing her away,


285
00:22:36.861 --> 00:22:38.428
then I had to do something

286
00:22:38.463 --> 00:22:40.364
because I could
not afford to lose her.


287
00:22:43.303 --> 00:22:47.008
You don't have to have
someone at home to succeed,


288
00:22:48.044 --> 00:22:51.980
but um, it sure as hell helps.

289
00:22:56.547 --> 00:22:57.986
That's all I got.

290
00:23:02.091 --> 00:23:04.828
It's really good to see
you today, Mike. A year!


291
00:23:05.963 --> 00:23:07.798
Bet it felt like a century, huh?

292
00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:09.129
Yeah, it's had its moments.

293
00:23:09.965 --> 00:23:12.045
Just remember, everybody
here has been where you are.


294
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:14.167
And if you ever
need anything, you know,


295
00:23:15.335 --> 00:23:16.807
I'm here for ya.

296
00:23:19.537 --> 00:23:20.811
Hey.

297
00:23:24.179 --> 00:23:25.442
You okay? Everything okay?

298
00:23:28.452 --> 00:23:30.412
I, uh, I'm having those
hallucinations again, man.


299
00:23:34.255 --> 00:23:36.222
- Did you slip?
- Of course not.


300
00:23:36.994 --> 00:23:38.290
Of course not.

301
00:23:38.325 --> 00:23:39.841
- Man, look, here's the thing.
- Hold on.


302
00:23:39.865 --> 00:23:41.271
It's the same
thing that used to happen


303
00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:42.932
when I was drinking
after the accident.


304
00:23:42.967 --> 00:23:44.109
Only now, this shit's
happening when I'm sober.


305
00:23:44.133 --> 00:23:46.100
- Okay.
- I'm scared.


306
00:23:49.105 --> 00:23:50.984
Okay. Wh... when did
these hallucinations start?


307
00:23:51.008 --> 00:23:52.238
About four days ago.

308
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:56.473
All right. Anything
unusual happen in your life?


309
00:23:56.741 --> 00:23:58.310
The... anything
overwhelming, you know,


310
00:23:58.345 --> 00:23:59.861
some stress from
out of nowhere, you know?


311
00:23:59.885 --> 00:24:01.049
Anything like that?

312
00:24:01.484 --> 00:24:03.348
No, man, just
the same as always.


313
00:24:03.383 --> 00:24:05.596
Katherine wants to have a baby.
I can't finish the novel.


314
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.088
How's the book coming?

315
00:24:08.124 --> 00:24:09.321
Hah, fucking brutal.

316
00:24:09.923 --> 00:24:11.443
I keep waiting
for inspiration to come,


317
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:14.194
show me what to do,
and it just won't come.


318
00:24:14.629 --> 00:24:20.002
Well, hey, look, just be
open to it. And it will. Okay?


319
00:24:20.037 --> 00:24:21.267
It will come.

320
00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:29.275
Jesus, Michael,
please do something!


321
00:24:38.385 --> 00:24:40.055
Look, you son of a bitch!

322
00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.610
<i>Remember me?</i>

323
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.455
Who is this?

324
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.006
<i>Remember me?</i>

325
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.430
Who is this?
Where are your parents?


326
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.426
<i>Remember me?</i>

327
00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:49.461
Where are your parents?

328
00:24:49.631 --> 00:24:51.231
I'm going to call the fuck...

329
00:24:51.266 --> 00:24:52.595
God damn it!

330
00:25:11.484 --> 00:25:13.418
Remember me?

331
00:25:14.287 --> 00:25:19.028
Remember me? Remember me?

332
00:25:25.102 --> 00:25:27.234
- Don't do that!
- What?


333
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:28.565
Don't jump out at me like that.

334
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.116
I'm so sorry.
I... I, you were yelling...


335
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.700
There was this
kid's voice on the phone.


336
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.630
- Look at the fridge...
- What? Look at what?


337
00:25:35.244 --> 00:25:36.309
Nothing.

338
00:25:36.878 --> 00:25:40.379
- Are you okay?
- No. No, I'm not.


339
00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:44.086
Um, who do
we know with a daughter?


340
00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:46.451
Who's got kids?
Who's... who's got kids, baby?


341
00:25:46.486 --> 00:25:47.716
Who's got kids?

342
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:49.190
I know a lot
of people with kids.


343
00:25:50.457 --> 00:25:51.687
I'm going back to bed.

344
00:26:02.304 --> 00:26:04.073
Someone's here,
somebody's in the house!


345
00:26:04.108 --> 00:26:05.173
Shh!

346
00:26:11.577 --> 00:26:12.741
Shh!

347
00:26:12.776 --> 00:26:14.380
No, I'm coming with you.

348
00:26:16.186 --> 00:26:17.251
Stay close.

349
00:26:45.611 --> 00:26:46.984
I have a weapon!

350
00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:51.648
I'm sorry.

351
00:26:51.683 --> 00:26:53.023
Shh!

352
00:27:11.835 --> 00:27:13.769
<i>We have another call coming</i>

353
00:27:13.804 --> 00:27:17.245
<i>in from Sherwood drive,
can someone check that out?</i>


354
00:27:21.284 --> 00:27:22.448
Well?

355
00:27:23.083 --> 00:27:24.747
I checked all around the house.

356
00:27:25.416 --> 00:27:27.354
And there's no
sign of a forced entry.


357
00:27:27.823 --> 00:27:30.753
Maybe it a raccoon,
or some other vermin.


358
00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:33.470
Triggered the alarm. That's
pretty common in these parts.


359
00:27:33.494 --> 00:27:34.757
Wh... That happens?

360
00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:36.176
No, no. We've been
here for three years.


361
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.265
It's never happened.

362
00:27:37.867 --> 00:27:41.203
Maybe someone got drunk
and set off the system,


363
00:27:41.238 --> 00:27:42.699
stumbling around in the dark.

364
00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:45.339
Really?

365
00:27:45.741 --> 00:27:47.704
I... I've been sober
for a year, Sheriff, so.


366
00:27:47.739 --> 00:27:50.740
I've seen people sober 30
years, then step right back


367
00:27:50.775 --> 00:27:52.808
into old habits
without missing a day.


368
00:27:53.076 --> 00:27:55.679
He... he doesn't drink.
I've been taking care of him.


369
00:27:56.214 --> 00:27:57.846
Well, isn't Mr. Lane
a lucky man to have


370
00:27:57.881 --> 00:27:59.320
you watch his back?

371
00:27:59.755 --> 00:28:02.191
Hey, you know, while
you're here, we've been getting


372
00:28:02.226 --> 00:28:04.787
these really weird phone calls
at all hours of the night.


373
00:28:05.089 --> 00:28:06.701
Is... is there anything
you can do about that?


374
00:28:06.725 --> 00:28:09.165
It's probably just
kids making prank calls.


375
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.364
No, it's not.

376
00:28:10.733 --> 00:28:12.135
It's different people.

377
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.565
One of them was a young child...

378
00:28:15.404 --> 00:28:18.240
Yeah, that's the burglary
on Sherwood. False alarm.


379
00:28:18.275 --> 00:28:19.615
<i>Deputy's going for a coffee,</i>

380
00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:21.144
<i>did you want anything?</i>

381
00:28:21.179 --> 00:28:22.453
Why don't you tell
the deputy to stay put


382
00:28:22.477 --> 00:28:23.707
till I get back?

383
00:28:23.742 --> 00:28:24.840
<i>Copy that.</i>

384
00:28:25.409 --> 00:28:27.876
So, are you... you going
to do anything?


385
00:28:27.911 --> 00:28:29.812
About what? Nobody broke in.

386
00:28:30.281 --> 00:28:31.814
You getting
prank calls from kids?


387
00:28:31.849 --> 00:28:33.354
Check with your neighbors,

388
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:34.732
I'm sure they're
getting the same calls.


389
00:28:34.756 --> 00:28:36.555
We have a small
department here, sir.


390
00:28:36.823 --> 00:28:40.097
I'd like to limit
the unnecessary paperwork.


391
00:28:40.566 --> 00:28:42.363
Now, should
an actual person break in?


392
00:28:43.132 --> 00:28:45.201
Don't hesitate to call.
Have a good evening.


393
00:28:45.236 --> 00:28:46.400
Yes, sir. You too.

394
00:28:46.435 --> 00:28:47.566
Thanks.

395
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:48.864
- Asshole.
- Shh!


396
00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:51.834
Ooh!

397
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.114
Mitch, right?

398
00:28:58.612 --> 00:28:59.692
I'm Michael, your neighbor.

399
00:29:00.246 --> 00:29:01.811
Hey Michael, my neighbor.

400
00:29:01.846 --> 00:29:03.483
Good to meet
you after three years.


401
00:29:05.223 --> 00:29:07.383
Yeah, I don't get out much.
I work from home, you know?


402
00:29:07.759 --> 00:29:10.193
That's cool, dude.
What's up?


403
00:29:10.862 --> 00:29:15.132
Um, look, have you, uh, have
you been getting any calls?


404
00:29:15.501 --> 00:29:16.826
Like, in
the middle of the night?


405
00:29:17.128 --> 00:29:18.907
People keep calling us
and saying, "Remember me?"


406
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:20.931
And then just hanging up.
Does that sound familiar?


407
00:29:21.133 --> 00:29:24.174
Holy shit. You get those too?

408
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.739
So what is it?
Just someone messing around?


409
00:29:28.774 --> 00:29:30.510
You have any idea who it is?

410
00:29:30.545 --> 00:29:32.842
Yeah, it's usually
one of my three ex-wives


411
00:29:32.877 --> 00:29:34.448
bitching that
I'm late with the alimony.


412
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.717
Well, fuck you for that.

413
00:29:39.752 --> 00:29:41.653
I'm sorry, man.
Come on, have a beer.


414
00:29:42.022 --> 00:29:45.921
Alimony, that's funny! Come on!

415
00:30:07.945 --> 00:30:11.848
- Hello.
- Hey.<i>Uh, are you okay?</i>


416
00:30:12.116 --> 00:30:15.192
Hey, baby. Yeah, everything's
great. How's your day?


417
00:30:16.723 --> 00:30:18.261
You're not drinking, are you?

418
00:30:18.997 --> 00:30:21.825
What?
Why would you even say that?


419
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.729
<i>Uh, it's just,
Mary called me today.</i>


420
00:30:24.764 --> 00:30:26.731
She's friends
with Mitch's girlfriend.


421
00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:29.371
And apparently, Mitch
thought you were acting weird.


422
00:30:29.406 --> 00:30:31.241
<i>All I did is go over
there and ask the guy</i>


423
00:30:31.276 --> 00:30:32.715
<i>if he's getting</i>
the same phone calls we are.


424
00:30:32.739 --> 00:30:34.244
That's it.

425
00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:35.586
<i>- That's all?</i>
- T... that's all.


426
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.390
You know, he's a bit
of a dick about it, and now,


427
00:30:37.414 --> 00:30:39.249
apparently,
he's telling the whole town.


428
00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:41.515
<i>Look, it's no big deal.</i>
Remember what the sheriff said?


429
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.517
Probably a lot of people
are getting the calls.


430
00:30:43.752 --> 00:30:45.453
Yeah, but I'm
the only one who's a drunk


431
00:30:45.488 --> 00:30:47.587
- for checking in on it.
- That's not true.


432
00:30:47.622 --> 00:30:49.787
Look, Michael,
uh, are you sure you're...


433
00:30:49.822 --> 00:30:51.393
You know what, 
I've got to go.

434
00:31:03.803 --> 00:31:04.868
Son of a bitch.

435
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.896
Look shite.

436
00:31:34.438 --> 00:31:35.734
Get out of here.

437
00:31:36.036 --> 00:31:38.539
This isn't you.
You're wasting your time.


438
00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:42.807
Leave. Me. Alone!

439
00:31:42.842 --> 00:31:45.040
You have bigger
things ahead of you.


440
00:31:46.945 --> 00:31:48.450
You are a visionary.

441
00:31:48.485 --> 00:31:49.748
Am I losing it?

442
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:54.456
All you need... is
a little bit of inspiration.


443
00:31:54.825 --> 00:31:56.051
Leave me alone!

444
00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:03.993
You were never like this
before Katherine came along.


445
00:32:04.628 --> 00:32:06.996
I think she's driving
you to the loony bin.


446
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:08.866
Leave me alone!

447
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:12.001
But don't worry.
I'll bring you back.


448
00:32:16.612 --> 00:32:18.414
Baby. I'm so sorry if...

449
00:32:18.449 --> 00:32:19.844
<i>Remember me?</i>

450
00:32:19.879 --> 00:32:21.417
Who the hell is this?

451
00:32:21.452 --> 00:32:22.812
<i>Remember me?</i>

452
00:32:24.048 --> 00:32:25.916
You stop calling me!

453
00:32:28.925 --> 00:32:31.724
Stop calling me, I'm...

454
00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:06.693
Hey, man, uh, sorry
about joking around earlier.


455
00:33:06.728 --> 00:33:08.629
It was so uncool of me. I...

456
00:33:08.664 --> 00:33:10.697
Mitch, I need
you to do two things.


457
00:33:10.899 --> 00:33:14.063
One, never,
ever look at my wife again.


458
00:33:14.698 --> 00:33:17.836
And, two, get off my porch
in the next five seconds.


459
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:19.882
And if anyone hears about
this conversation around town,


460
00:33:19.906 --> 00:33:21.543
you should know I have a 357.

461
00:33:21.878 --> 00:33:23.512
You're seriously threatening me?

462
00:33:23.547 --> 00:33:24.777
Stay on my porch and find out.

463
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.878
Cool.

464
00:33:43.633 --> 00:33:46.799
I talked with Ariel,
Mitch's girlfriend.


465
00:33:47.334 --> 00:33:49.032
She says that you threatened
to shoot him.


466
00:33:49.067 --> 00:33:50.605
I told him to mind
his own business.


467
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.068
So you threatened to shoot him?

468
00:33:52.103 --> 00:33:53.839
I mentioned, as an aside,
that I have a gun.


469
00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:55.834
How he chose to interpret
it is his business.


470
00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.744
What the hell
is wrong with you lately?


471
00:33:58.714 --> 00:33:59.911
He called me a drunk, Kat!

472
00:34:00.346 --> 00:34:02.980
Well, he shouldn't
have said that, but, you know,


473
00:34:03.015 --> 00:34:04.553
maybe he was
just worried about you.


474
00:34:04.888 --> 00:34:06.885
Maybe if you got
to know some of these people,


475
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.590
they'd be able
to tell who you really are.


476
00:34:09.326 --> 00:34:11.692
I just feel like
a stranger here, and...


477
00:34:11.727 --> 00:34:13.188
And I really like it here,

478
00:34:13.223 --> 00:34:15.003
and I want to get
to know these people, and...


479
00:34:15.027 --> 00:34:16.664
And you're threatening them?

480
00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.072
I mean, do you really
think that that helps?


481
00:34:18.096 --> 00:34:19.194
Do you think this helps?

482
00:34:20.703 --> 00:34:22.183
Do you think
I need any more pressure?


483
00:34:38.215 --> 00:34:40.523
Kathy, could you get
me the flat head, babe?


484
00:34:48.093 --> 00:34:50.053
Hey Kathy, could you get
me the flat head, please?


485
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:53.976
What, are you giving
the silent treatment?


486
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.934
Could you please
get me the flat head?


487
00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:58.068
What are you shouting about?

488
00:35:07.277 --> 00:35:10.751
- Oh my...
- What?


489
00:35:11.253 --> 00:35:13.149
- Did you see her?
- Who?


490
00:35:13.184 --> 00:35:15.888
- The woman.
- What woman?


491
00:35:18.321 --> 00:35:19.595
The woman in the dress.

492
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:27.834
I didn't see anyone.

493
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.188
Look, I just want
you to admit that you haven't


494
00:35:41.212 --> 00:35:42.552
really been yourself lately.

495
00:35:43.221 --> 00:35:44.686
And we can
figure it out from there.


496
00:35:53.998 --> 00:35:56.258
And I think
you should apologize to Mitch.


497
00:36:19.987 --> 00:36:21.723
How'd it go?

498
00:36:21.758 --> 00:36:23.670
I mean, I'm not going to get
an invite to poker night,


499
00:36:23.694 --> 00:36:24.858
but we're good.

500
00:36:26.191 --> 00:36:27.289
Aw, thank you.

501
00:36:28.225 --> 00:36:32.228
Yeah. You, uh,
you want to call Bill and Mary?


502
00:36:32.597 --> 00:36:34.571
Have them bring Mason
again over tomorrow?


503
00:36:35.073 --> 00:36:37.002
Aw, I'd love that.

504
00:36:37.037 --> 00:36:38.333
Yeah? Okay.

505
00:38:28.379 --> 00:38:30.459
I thought you said you were
gonna put them on silent.


506
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.952
I did.

507
00:39:42.288 --> 00:39:43.826
<i>Message erased.</i>

508
00:40:43.052 --> 00:40:44.480
Oh my God!

509
00:40:44.515 --> 00:40:46.152
Keep it down,
I'm trying to sleep.


510
00:41:06.405 --> 00:41:08.405
We really are glad
you guys stopped by.


511
00:41:09.107 --> 00:41:11.474
Mason, Mason, baby slow down.

512
00:41:11.509 --> 00:41:13.179
- Buddy, don't trip.
- You're gonna fall.


513
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:17.348
Well, we were really
glad to hear from you.


514
00:41:17.383 --> 00:41:20.857
You know, we... we tried
to call several times,


515
00:41:21.259 --> 00:41:22.551
but there was never any answer.

516
00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.388
Think she never heard of email.

517
00:41:24.423 --> 00:41:25.521
Sh!

518
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:30.163
Hey, are you guys okay?

519
00:41:31.562 --> 00:41:32.627
Michael?

520
00:41:33.399 --> 00:41:35.168
Yeah, we're fine.

521
00:41:35.203 --> 00:41:36.972
Michael's just been
really busy with his...


522
00:41:37.007 --> 00:41:38.534
With his book.

523
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:40.536
- Good.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's good.


524
00:41:41.238 --> 00:41:43.176
We all go through
times like this, right?


525
00:41:43.578 --> 00:41:46.443
I mean, last year, I was
a big ball of stress from UPS.


526
00:41:46.478 --> 00:41:48.280
Cut back my shifts, you know?

527
00:41:49.149 --> 00:41:52.647
But we pulled through,
bad times are like good times,


528
00:41:52.682 --> 00:41:54.352
right? They eventually end.

529
00:41:54.654 --> 00:41:57.058
Yeah. I've just
been so exhausted,


530
00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.258
with the opening
of the boutique...


531
00:41:59.293 --> 00:42:00.391
Of course.

532
00:42:01.026 --> 00:42:03.394
And, uh, phone's
just been ringing nonstop.


533
00:42:05.068 --> 00:42:06.199
From whom?

534
00:42:06.568 --> 00:42:08.465
Just different people.

535
00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.006
We... we talked to the police
about it, and they finally


536
00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:12.139
agreed to trace the calls.

537
00:42:12.174 --> 00:42:13.272
That's good.

538
00:42:13.874 --> 00:42:16.209
Bet it'll feel good
when they catch the punks, huh?


539
00:42:16.244 --> 00:42:18.222
They better hope the police get
'em first. 'cause if I do,


540
00:42:18.246 --> 00:42:20.389
I'm gonna cut off each of their
fingers one by one with pinking


541
00:42:20.413 --> 00:42:22.613
shears, until they can never
dial a fucking phone again.


542
00:42:27.057 --> 00:42:30.223
Well... Let's hope
it doesn't come to that. Heh.


543
00:42:30.959 --> 00:42:32.995
The good thing is,
is that nobody got hurt.


544
00:42:33.797 --> 00:42:35.569
I... I'm sure that the police
are going to get


545
00:42:35.593 --> 00:42:37.263
to the bottom of it.

546
00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:53.576
Wait. Stop.

547
00:42:53.611 --> 00:42:56.117
<i>Shot. Me shot.</i>

548
00:42:56.152 --> 00:42:59.153
Mason. Mason, stop!

549
00:43:02.587 --> 00:43:04.521
<i>22. Shot me.</i>

550
00:43:05.689 --> 00:43:08.261
Mason!
Mason! Honey, what happened?


551
00:43:08.296 --> 00:43:11.297
Michael, what happened?
Michael!


552
00:43:12.663 --> 00:43:17.072
Come on, baby, come on.
Get up, get up. Bill!


553
00:43:20.773 --> 00:43:22.242
Did you push Mason?

554
00:43:22.277 --> 00:43:24.310
Hey, what did you do to my kid?

555
00:43:24.745 --> 00:43:27.313
Are you listening?
What is wrong with... oh!


556
00:43:29.053 --> 00:43:33.385
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

557
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.717
Michael! What are you doing?
Michael, stop it!


558
00:43:35.752 --> 00:43:37.422
Stop it, Michael! Stop!

559
00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:40.623
Bill!

560
00:43:40.992 --> 00:43:43.692
Oh my God!
Get the fuck off of him!


561
00:43:43.727 --> 00:43:45.694
Don't touch him.
Get off! Get off...


562
00:43:46.063 --> 00:43:47.399
God, you guys!

563
00:43:47.768 --> 00:43:49.368
What are you doing?

564
00:43:49.737 --> 00:43:52.173
Michael, what the fuck
is wrong with you?


565
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.109
I'm sorr...

566
00:43:54.144 --> 00:43:55.671
I can't fucking believe you.

567
00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.805
Let's go.
We got to get out of here.


568
00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.320
Let's get Mason,
let's get outta here.


569
00:43:59.548 --> 00:44:01.512
Mary, please, I...

570
00:44:01.547 --> 00:44:03.118
Kat, I cannot! I'm sorry.

571
00:44:08.353 --> 00:44:10.191
I... I played
the message backwards,


572
00:44:10.226 --> 00:44:11.522
and that's what I heard.

573
00:44:11.557 --> 00:44:12.997
Yeah, I played
the message backwards.


574
00:44:13.423 --> 00:44:16.164
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy,
but you've got to listen to me.


575
00:44:16.366 --> 00:44:18.397
I played the message backwards,
I heard the...


576
00:44:18.899 --> 00:44:22.599
Hello? Yes.
I... I'm sorry, Sheriff


577
00:44:23.034 --> 00:44:24.843
It's... yeah, he...
He hasn't been feeling good.


578
00:44:24.867 --> 00:44:27.538
Can you please just let us know
if you find out anything?


579
00:44:27.573 --> 00:44:29.375
- Thanks.
- What... what did he say?


580
00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.773
Enough! You're pushing
everyone away, including me.


581
00:44:31.808 --> 00:44:33.346
No, baby. No, listen.

582
00:44:33.381 --> 00:44:34.655
You said that you
would always believe me


583
00:44:34.679 --> 00:44:36.415
as long as I told
you the truth. And I'm...


584
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.747
I'm telling you,
I need you to believe me now.


585
00:44:38.782 --> 00:44:41.123
I... I heard
something on the machine.


586
00:44:41.158 --> 00:44:43.092
Okay, will you just listen?

587
00:44:43.127 --> 00:44:44.522
<i>No new messages.</i>

588
00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:45.699
- There's a...
<i>- No new messages.</i>


589
00:44:45.723 --> 00:44:47.426
The a...

590
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:49.395
<i>No new messages.
No new messages.</i>


591
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:52.299
I know... I know I,
uh, heard something.


592
00:44:52.334 --> 00:44:53.861
<i>No new messages.</i>

593
00:44:53.896 --> 00:44:56.105
<i>No new messages.
No new messages.</i>


594
00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.636
When you... When you...
When you play it backwards.


595
00:45:01.475 --> 00:45:02.705
I'm... She was...

596
00:45:05.314 --> 00:45:07.578
She said her name
was Valerie Washington.


597
00:45:07.613 --> 00:45:11.351
Do you... Do we know
a Valerie Washington?


598
00:45:11.386 --> 00:45:13.353
No, we don't know any Valerie!

599
00:45:13.388 --> 00:45:14.882
We don't know
only Valerie Washington!


600
00:45:14.917 --> 00:45:16.356
You didn't hear anything.

601
00:45:22.232 --> 00:45:24.232
You can trust me.

602
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:28.104
I think you need
to take a break from your book.


603
00:45:29.668 --> 00:45:31.503
I think that
the pressure is getting to you.


604
00:45:39.249 --> 00:45:40.380
It's okay.

605
00:46:14.944 --> 00:46:17.945
Now, my reasons for drinking
were almost occupational.


606
00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.321
I'm a psychiatrist.
And being a psychiatrist,


607
00:46:20.356 --> 00:46:22.202
I listen to people's problems
all the time, every day.


608
00:46:22.226 --> 00:46:23.786
You know, on top of my own.

609
00:46:25.262 --> 00:46:26.690
And then,
of course, my alcoholism,


610
00:46:26.725 --> 00:46:31.596
I... I felt that
drinking was, um, my escape.


611
00:46:31.631 --> 00:46:33.301
Um, that I deserved it.

612
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.766
And so, I started to drink.

613
00:46:39.474 --> 00:46:40.572
And...

614
00:46:43.412 --> 00:46:47.843
I got lost. I got very lost.
I lost many things.


615
00:46:48.912 --> 00:46:50.285
I lost everything.

616
00:46:51.387 --> 00:46:54.454
I lost my job. 
I lost my wife.

617
00:46:58.361 --> 00:46:59.624
I lost my reputation.

618
00:47:00.891 --> 00:47:02.594
I I... lost my dignity.

619
00:47:05.467 --> 00:47:06.763
I lost my kids.

620
00:47:09.438 --> 00:47:11.471
Did it stop me? No.

621
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.674
See, I couldn't accept the fact
that I loved the next drink


622
00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:18.742
more than
I loved my own children.


623
00:47:20.614 --> 00:47:24.616
But I did...
that.


624
00:47:25.385 --> 00:47:27.817
And we all know
that getting sober is just...


625
00:47:27.852 --> 00:47:29.918
half the battle.
It's staying sober.


626
00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.558
Staying sober.

627
00:47:32.593 --> 00:47:34.769
Ladies and gentlemen, staying
sober is the hardest thing.


628
00:47:34.793 --> 00:47:36.430
It's the hardest part.

629
00:47:36.465 --> 00:47:37.739
It is the hardest
thing I've ever done.


630
00:47:37.763 --> 00:47:39.499
And it's the hardest part.

631
00:47:39.534 --> 00:47:41.413
We can all come up with
an excuse to have a drink.


632
00:47:41.437 --> 00:47:43.932
For God's sake. You feel good,
you feel bad, you feel sad,


633
00:47:43.967 --> 00:47:46.803
you feel happy. 
Hey, that was...

634
00:49:05.048 --> 00:49:07.048
Who's there? Who's there?

635
00:49:53.866 --> 00:49:55.668
Fuck.

636
00:51:21.657 --> 00:51:25.087
Michael. Michael.
Stop it. Stop it.


637
00:51:25.122 --> 00:51:26.561
What are you doing?

638
00:51:26.596 --> 00:51:28.024
It's not in my head. It's not.

639
00:51:28.059 --> 00:51:29.806
- I thought we were past this.
- I saw... it.


640
00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:31.643
I saw it again. And...
And something happened here.


641
00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:32.930
Oh, fuck.

642
00:51:32.965 --> 00:51:34.668
And... and... and they...
They... they.


643
00:51:34.703 --> 00:51:36.274
Maybe it wants the house
Maybe it wants us to leave.


644
00:51:36.298 --> 00:51:37.979
- I thought we were past this.
- Maybe it wants us to leave.


645
00:51:38.003 --> 00:51:39.574
Maybe the realtor lied to us.

646
00:51:39.609 --> 00:51:40.817
- What are you doing?
- Maybe there's something


647
00:51:40.841 --> 00:51:42.269
she's not telling us, you know?

648
00:51:42.304 --> 00:51:44.139
Because um,
do you know who lived here?


649
00:51:44.174 --> 00:51:46.152
I don't know who... who lived
here before us. And maybe...


650
00:51:46.176 --> 00:51:47.747
And why did they leave?

651
00:51:47.782 --> 00:51:49.595
You know why... why...
Why did they have to go?


652
00:51:49.619 --> 00:51:52.180
- You are insane.
- These people, these things...


653
00:51:52.215 --> 00:51:53.786
They... they...
They want us to know.


654
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:55.128
They want us to
know what's going on.


655
00:51:55.152 --> 00:51:56.624
What are you doing?

656
00:51:56.659 --> 00:51:58.021
You know who
lived here before us?


657
00:51:58.056 --> 00:51:59.572
I don't know why they
chose me, but they did.


658
00:51:59.596 --> 00:52:00.705
- And... and... and...
- You drank?


659
00:52:00.729 --> 00:52:02.630
- Ah, fuck.
- You drank?


660
00:52:02.665 --> 00:52:04.038
I'm not going to
give them the house.


661
00:52:04.062 --> 00:52:05.864
- You fucking drank?
- I'm not going to leave.


662
00:52:07.164 --> 00:52:08.295
That's not what's important.

663
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.637
You said you would never drink.

664
00:52:09.672 --> 00:52:10.836
That's not what's important.

665
00:52:10.871 --> 00:52:12.191
- Listen to me. Listen.
- Asshole.


666
00:52:12.703 --> 00:52:14.136
I'm just trying to protect you.

667
00:52:14.171 --> 00:52:15.577
From what? The boogie man.

668
00:52:15.612 --> 00:52:16.875
Who is trying to get us.

669
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:18.745
All of the secret
messages that are hidden


670
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.208
in the phone calls.

671
00:52:21.783 --> 00:52:24.883
I've tried everything
I can do to help you. I'm done.


672
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:30.526
No, no, Katherine.
I need you to believe me.


673
00:52:31.295 --> 00:52:32.990
I'll come back to
get the rest of my stuff


674
00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:34.255
when you're gone. Move!

675
00:52:59.986 --> 00:53:01.986
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't mean to scare you.


676
00:53:03.121 --> 00:53:04.318
It's okay.

677
00:53:04.353 --> 00:53:06.023
Well, I tried calling,

678
00:53:06.058 --> 00:53:07.858
but it seems you're not
answering your phones.


679
00:53:08.929 --> 00:53:09.994
Sorry about that.

680
00:53:10.029 --> 00:53:11.798
Ah, it's no problem.

681
00:53:11.833 --> 00:53:13.873
We got some information
back on those private calls.


682
00:53:13.997 --> 00:53:15.769
Now, you say
the phone was unplugged,


683
00:53:15.804 --> 00:53:16.902
but it was still ringing?

684
00:53:17.971 --> 00:53:19.641
No, that was a mistake.

685
00:53:20.443 --> 00:53:22.204
I thought that
sounded a little crazy.


686
00:53:22.239 --> 00:53:24.580
Even though what we found
was a little crazy in itself.


687
00:53:25.242 --> 00:53:27.044
What do you mean?

688
00:53:27.079 --> 00:53:28.958
Well, normally we can easily
trace these types of calls


689
00:53:28.982 --> 00:53:31.180
because all numbers,
including private ones,


690
00:53:31.215 --> 00:53:33.083
have a trace route.

691
00:53:33.118 --> 00:53:35.261
What was weird was every time
we tried one of your calls,


692
00:53:35.285 --> 00:53:36.625
our systems crashed.

693
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.957
It worked with every
other number we tried.


694
00:53:39.559 --> 00:53:41.762
But yours kept
causing our equipment to fail.


695
00:53:44.393 --> 00:53:45.667
That's weird.

696
00:53:50.432 --> 00:53:52.300
So, we called up some tech guys

697
00:53:52.335 --> 00:53:54.874
and they said the problem
is the trace route was connected


698
00:53:54.909 --> 00:53:58.108
to a... What did they
call it? A null number.


699
00:53:58.781 --> 00:54:00.242
Null number?

700
00:54:00.277 --> 00:54:03.113
Meaning it doesn't exist,
like an empty data set.


701
00:54:03.148 --> 00:54:04.785
As if it
appeared out of nowhere.


702
00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:06.754
It had to have
appeared from somewhere.


703
00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:09.251
Well, there is more.
That name your husband gave us,


704
00:54:09.286 --> 00:54:10.857
Valerie, uh...

705
00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:13.761
Valerie Washington.

706
00:54:13.796 --> 00:54:16.192
Yes. Yes.
She died four years ago,


707
00:54:16.227 --> 00:54:18.128
victim of some serial killer.

708
00:54:18.163 --> 00:54:20.483
Now, her murder, along with
four others, were never solved.


709
00:54:20.796 --> 00:54:23.936
There are no witnesses,
no leads. Case is now closed.


710
00:54:26.402 --> 00:54:27.643
I was right.

711
00:54:28.811 --> 00:54:30.844
Mr. Lane,
I didn't see you there.


712
00:54:30.879 --> 00:54:32.439
I was just telling your wife...

713
00:54:32.474 --> 00:54:35.178
About the phone calls and...
And Valerie Washington.


714
00:54:37.919 --> 00:54:40.953
Did... did she or
any of the other victims


715
00:54:40.988 --> 00:54:42.185
live in this house?

716
00:54:42.787 --> 00:54:45.826
Well, you don't think
she's calling you from beyond?


717
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.732
No, no, no, no. None
of the victims lived here,


718
00:54:50.767 --> 00:54:53.834
as far as I know. Why do
you think they chose you?


719
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.299
I ask myself that every day.

720
00:54:58.841 --> 00:55:00.346
Well, even though
I'm skeptical of all sorts


721
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.206
of paranormal
activity, what do I know?


722
00:55:04.275 --> 00:55:05.747
She calls you again,

723
00:55:05.782 --> 00:55:07.881
maybe you can ask
her who killed her.


724
00:55:08.583 --> 00:55:10.884
Move a couple of our
cases to solved column.


725
00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:15.152
Well, I got to be
getting back to the station.


726
00:55:15.187 --> 00:55:17.154
Sheriff Stance
turned the matter over to me,


727
00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:19.827
so if anything else
comes up, just give me a call.


728
00:55:20.429 --> 00:55:21.895
What happened with the sheriff?

729
00:55:23.393 --> 00:55:24.766
His plate is full.

730
00:55:25.494 --> 00:55:27.098
He loves me.

731
00:55:27.133 --> 00:55:28.773
That may have
something to do with it too.


732
00:55:29.472 --> 00:55:31.069
You folks have a good evening.

733
00:55:45.888 --> 00:55:47.415
Sorry I didn't believe you.

734
00:56:00.562 --> 00:56:01.869
Let's go inside.

735
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.233
<i>Next message.</i>

736
00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:40.468
<i>My name is
Haley Sanders. Haley Sanders</i>


737
00:56:43.946 --> 00:56:45.374
<i>Next message.</i>

738
00:56:45.409 --> 00:56:46.518
<i>Mary Ann Sanders.</i>

739
00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:48.476
<i>My name is Mary Ann Sanders.</i>

740
00:56:51.514 --> 00:56:52.821
<i>Next message.</i>

741
00:56:57.157 --> 00:56:58.237
<i>End of messages.</i>

742
00:57:07.365 --> 00:57:09.266
You know, I think
the deputy's onto something.


743
00:57:09.534 --> 00:57:11.070
I found four more names.

744
00:57:11.439 --> 00:57:13.138
And I get the feeling

745
00:57:13.173 --> 00:57:14.612
like they want me
to help them, you know?


746
00:57:14.636 --> 00:57:16.251
Like they want me
to bring them some justice


747
00:57:16.275 --> 00:57:17.912
to find the guy that did this.

748
00:57:18.748 --> 00:57:20.376
Why they picked us,
I don't know, but...


749
00:57:21.445 --> 00:57:23.148
Babe, I've got to get some rest.

750
00:57:23.183 --> 00:57:25.018
I can't keep my eyes open.

751
00:57:25.053 --> 00:57:27.482
Okay, well, just let me know
if you need anything, okay?


752
00:57:27.517 --> 00:57:28.582
I'll leave you the towel.

753
00:57:28.617 --> 00:57:29.891
Okay, baby.

754
00:57:34.524 --> 00:57:35.996
Baby want some...

755
00:57:39.562 --> 00:57:40.836
Baby?

756
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:45.335
Baby? Katherine?
What's happening?


757
00:57:45.370 --> 00:57:47.007
Sweetheart?

758
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.514
Look, you never really know
with these kinds of seizures.


759
00:58:01.155 --> 00:58:02.627
You're telling me
she took all her medication?


760
00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:03.925
Absolutely.

761
00:58:04.427 --> 00:58:06.224
- No drugs?
- No.


762
00:58:06.259 --> 00:58:07.995
- Not too much alcohol?
- No, no, no.


763
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:10.261
I'm telling you, everything
was the way it should be.


764
00:58:11.063 --> 00:58:14.969
My best guess is she might
have some kind of a infection


765
00:58:15.004 --> 00:58:17.246
and she may be fighting it and
her body went into overdrive.


766
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:18.907
What kind of infection?

767
00:58:18.942 --> 00:58:20.348
I don't know.
I don't think it's meningitis,


768
00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:22.306
but we could run some
tests to find out later.


769
00:58:22.841 --> 00:58:24.946
But... she needs her rest.

770
00:58:24.981 --> 00:58:26.673
And if her temperature goes up

771
00:58:26.708 --> 00:58:30.314
or she has another seizure,
we may need to admit her, okay?


772
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:31.645
- Okay.
- Just keep an eye out.


773
00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.954
Okay.

774
00:58:34.254 --> 00:58:35.484
Larry Osmond.

775
00:58:37.422 --> 00:58:38.586
Vicki Johnson.

776
00:58:40.491 --> 00:58:41.996
Yep. That's the rest of them.

777
00:58:42.031 --> 00:58:43.426
At least what I can tell.

778
00:58:43.461 --> 00:58:45.043
What do you mean?
Don't you have the records?


779
00:58:45.067 --> 00:58:46.561
Not here.

780
00:58:46.596 --> 00:58:49.300
Just a single photo
and some basic information.


781
00:58:49.335 --> 00:58:52.006
A name, age,
birth date, a brief description


782
00:58:52.041 --> 00:58:54.602
and date of death.
No proper files.


783
00:58:55.671 --> 00:58:57.671
How can that be?

784
00:58:57.706 --> 00:58:59.684
Well, newer deputies don't get
access to confidential files.


785
00:58:59.708 --> 00:59:02.115
All we have is what is
already on public records.


786
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.183
But you can get access, right?

787
00:59:04.218 --> 00:59:05.492
Only with
the sheriff's permission.


788
00:59:05.516 --> 00:59:07.120
And he's not
going to grant that.


789
00:59:07.155 --> 00:59:09.617
Look, even if he did...
let me see them,


790
00:59:09.652 --> 00:59:11.388
they're confidential.

791
00:59:11.423 --> 00:59:12.697
<i>I can't tell you what's in them.</i>

792
00:59:12.721 --> 00:59:15.260
But I can solve these murders.

793
00:59:15.295 --> 00:59:16.459
Let's not get carried away.

794
00:59:16.928 --> 00:59:18.659
Now, Sheriff Stance doesn't want

795
00:59:18.694 --> 00:59:20.969
to go through this anymore.
And he pulled me off.


796
00:59:21.004 --> 00:59:23.466
He's advised me not to
have any more contact with you.


797
00:59:24.205 --> 00:59:26.073
What?

798
00:59:26.108 --> 00:59:27.712
He's afraid you're going to
give the families false hope.


799
00:59:27.736 --> 00:59:30.374
Now I can lose my job just
by having this conversation.


800
00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:34.444
I'm sorry, Michael. I wish
there was more I could do.


801
00:59:34.479 --> 00:59:36.743
<i>My advice to you,
for what it's worth:</i>


802
00:59:36.778 --> 00:59:38.349
<i>Let the past stay that way.</i>

803
00:59:38.384 --> 00:59:40.021
Yeah. They won't let me.

804
00:59:51.067 --> 00:59:52.968
You can run, but you can't hide.

805
00:59:54.697 --> 00:59:56.301
I'm going to burry
this son of a bitch.


806
01:02:55.845 --> 01:02:57.185
Katherine?

807
01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.585
Kathy?

808
01:03:23.312 --> 01:03:24.476
Kathy!

809
01:03:42.463 --> 01:03:43.759
Katherine?

810
01:04:00.008 --> 01:04:01.315
Kat?

811
01:04:03.616 --> 01:04:04.846
Kat?

812
01:04:08.588 --> 01:04:10.357
You should be in bed, baby.

813
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:12.920
Okay.

814
01:04:25.374 --> 01:04:26.472
Breathe.

815
01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.344
That's it.

816
01:04:37.078 --> 01:04:38.385
Okay. I got you. Come on.

817
01:04:41.819 --> 01:04:43.423
I got you. I got you.

818
01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:45.557
I got you.
I got you.


819
01:04:47.693 --> 01:04:48.758
I got you.

820
01:04:52.093 --> 01:04:53.862
- I saw her.
- Who did you see, baby?


821
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.880
Who, baby? Who did you see?

822
01:05:32.133 --> 01:05:33.407
Katherine?

823
01:05:35.609 --> 01:05:36.674
Kathy?

824
01:05:42.143 --> 01:05:44.550
What are you doing, baby?
What are you doing?


825
01:05:44.585 --> 01:05:46.552
Baby? What are you doing?

826
01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:49.357
Baby, what's going on?

827
01:05:54.023 --> 01:05:55.528
What do you want?

828
01:05:56.397 --> 01:05:59.125
What do you want?
I'm trying to fucking help you!


829
01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.963
I'm trying to fucking
help you! Leave her alone!


830
01:06:02.365 --> 01:06:03.932
Leave her alone!

831
01:06:26.825 --> 01:06:28.462
Okay.

832
01:06:28.497 --> 01:06:32.125
Wait, wait for it.
We're all about set and...


833
01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.701
three, two, one. Boom!

834
01:06:36.736 --> 01:06:37.900
You're in, dude.

835
01:06:37.935 --> 01:06:40.067
Use it for good, not for evil.

836
01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:41.805
Thanks, man.

837
01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.741
Oh, man.
Thank you. Yeah.


838
01:06:43.776 --> 01:06:46.106
And remember,
you only got 90 minutes


839
01:06:46.141 --> 01:06:49.549
before the whole thing just
self shuts down, right? Okay?


840
01:06:49.584 --> 01:06:52.750
And uh, if you get busted, bro.

841
01:06:52.785 --> 01:06:57.557
I only came here to fix
your hard drive.<i>Comprende?</i>


842
01:06:57.592 --> 01:06:59.112
Got it. You came
to fix the hard drive.


843
01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.699
Sheriff Boyd.

844
01:08:08.124 --> 01:08:09.189
Thrill.

845
01:08:10.929 --> 01:08:13.028
Was it... Was it
a thrill for him?


846
01:09:44.858 --> 01:09:45.956
My god.

847
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:54.767
He's following these.

848
01:09:55.402 --> 01:09:56.703
He's following all of them.

849
01:10:03.811 --> 01:10:05.107
Visionary...

850
01:10:08.046 --> 01:10:09.177
Which one was visionary?

851
01:10:16.252 --> 01:10:17.350
No.

852
01:10:17.585 --> 01:10:19.319
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.


853
01:10:19.354 --> 01:10:21.255
No, there's...
There's one more murder.


854
01:10:27.362 --> 01:10:28.900
Shit.

855
01:10:33.005 --> 01:10:34.268
Who's the sixth victim?

856
01:10:37.306 --> 01:10:38.404
How you feeling, baby?

857
01:10:38.439 --> 01:10:39.779
I feel great.

858
01:10:41.915 --> 01:10:43.046
What's wrong?

859
01:10:45.787 --> 01:10:48.381
He tortured them. All of them.

860
01:10:50.088 --> 01:10:52.759
It was a... a game and
the sick son of a bitch


861
01:10:52.794 --> 01:10:53.859
is still out there.

862
01:10:55.764 --> 01:10:59.392
What are you going to do?
Try and get the cases reopened?


863
01:10:59.427 --> 01:11:00.701
I don't think I can.

864
01:11:01.537 --> 01:11:03.803
Sheriff Stance is
determined to keep a lid on it.


865
01:11:03.838 --> 01:11:05.772
And he fired
the last two deputies and...


866
01:11:05.807 --> 01:11:07.136
And there still
is a sixth victim.


867
01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:08.368
And there's no record for it.

868
01:11:08.703 --> 01:11:10.414
Do you think that
Sheriff Stance had something


869
01:11:10.438 --> 01:11:11.712
to do with it?

870
01:11:12.209 --> 01:11:13.274
I don't know.

871
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:18.246
I hadn't even
thought about that.


872
01:11:20.019 --> 01:11:21.887
I hope that the ghosts are happy

873
01:11:21.922 --> 01:11:23.724
with all the hard
work that you're doing.


874
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:27.057
I am so proud of you.

875
01:11:27.895 --> 01:11:28.960
Thank you, baby.

876
01:11:31.492 --> 01:11:32.766
Here.

877
01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:37.067
Come on. Let's celebrate.

878
01:12:10.399 --> 01:12:11.904
Oh, fuck.

879
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:19.439
He's coming.

880
01:12:21.245 --> 01:12:22.882
Oh, shit!

881
01:12:25.986 --> 01:12:27.282
Jesus.

882
01:12:28.318 --> 01:12:30.956
What the fuck. 
What the fuck.

883
01:12:30.991 --> 01:12:32.958
What the fuck.
What the fuck.


884
01:12:35.094 --> 01:12:40.163
Connor Lucas.

885
01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:09.830
Who was Connor Lucas?

886
01:13:10.499 --> 01:13:13.196
Is he...
Is he the sixth victim?


887
01:13:15.332 --> 01:13:17.134
Or was he the murderer?

888
01:14:16.459 --> 01:14:17.898
Son of a bitch.

889
01:14:18.634 --> 01:14:20.263
There's a pattern.
There's a pattern.


890
01:14:20.298 --> 01:14:21.638
Each of these crimes
is completely different,


891
01:14:21.662 --> 01:14:23.178
but they all share
one thing in common.


892
01:14:23.202 --> 01:14:25.400
Each fits one
type of serial killer.


893
01:14:25.435 --> 01:14:28.205
And he covered this
with meticulous detail.


894
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.877
Like this one.

895
01:14:29.912 --> 01:14:31.285
This is when the killer
takes something valuable


896
01:14:31.309 --> 01:14:32.374
from the victim.

897
01:14:32.409 --> 01:14:34.145
This is the only victim

898
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.300
that had something taken
from them. Look what it says.


899
01:14:38.118 --> 01:14:39.579
Gain.

900
01:14:39.614 --> 01:14:42.450
Gain. This is his signature.

901
01:14:42.485 --> 01:14:45.156
Each one fits a type.
But this one here.


902
01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:46.652
This one's missing.

903
01:14:46.687 --> 01:14:48.467
This one's missing
from the pattern. Visionary.


904
01:14:48.491 --> 01:14:50.458
Well, maybe he got
scared, wised up, moved away.


905
01:14:50.493 --> 01:14:52.493
No, no, he's not scared.
Look at the crime scenes.


906
01:14:52.528 --> 01:14:54.000
Does this guy
look scared to you?


907
01:14:56.433 --> 01:14:58.048
Well, I can certainly
run it by the Sheriff,


908
01:14:58.072 --> 01:14:59.170
see what he says.

909
01:14:59.205 --> 01:15:02.338
That's ah... I don't... I don't...

910
01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:03.438
That's not a good idea.

911
01:15:04.639 --> 01:15:05.946
What are you saying?

912
01:15:07.345 --> 01:15:09.444
Look, the last two deputies

913
01:15:09.479 --> 01:15:11.050
who went poking
around were fired, okay?


914
01:15:11.085 --> 01:15:12.645
I don't want you lose your job.

915
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.186
No. There's no way the sheriff
would protect the killer.


916
01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:16.528
Yes, but he
would protect himself.


917
01:15:16.552 --> 01:15:17.991
Okay, now you're losing me.

918
01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:20.554
And you got to be careful

919
01:15:20.589 --> 01:15:22.226
making these types
of allegations.


920
01:15:22.261 --> 01:15:24.063
Now, if you want to
get along in this town,


921
01:15:24.098 --> 01:15:25.592
you got to watch who you offend.

922
01:15:27.497 --> 01:15:29.134
Look, all I'm trying to say

923
01:15:29.169 --> 01:15:31.433
is that the two local
murders were investigated


924
01:15:31.468 --> 01:15:33.215
by the sheriff and they
were not investigated properly.


925
01:15:33.239 --> 01:15:35.404
And the two deputies
who said something were fired.


926
01:15:35.439 --> 01:15:38.011
Then, the mayor makes
this generous contribution


927
01:15:38.046 --> 01:15:40.574
to the sheriff's road safety
campaign, and a month later,


928
01:15:40.609 --> 01:15:42.378
the sheriff buys
a brand new home.


929
01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:44.182
So now the mayor is involved.

930
01:15:44.217 --> 01:15:46.426
No... I'm not... I'm not...
Mayor, no mayor, I don't know.


931
01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:48.153
But the sheriff is involved.

932
01:15:48.188 --> 01:15:50.617
And I am... I am this
close to finding the truth.


933
01:15:57.494 --> 01:15:59.296
Okay. I want to help.

934
01:16:00.497 --> 01:16:02.002
I'll look into it,

935
01:16:02.037 --> 01:16:03.212
see if I can find
some more information


936
01:16:03.236 --> 01:16:04.301
on the sixth victim.

937
01:16:04.336 --> 01:16:05.698
Okay.

938
01:16:05.733 --> 01:16:07.469
Until then,
let's keep this between us.


939
01:16:07.504 --> 01:16:10.208
- Absolutely.
- Just... pump the brakes


940
01:16:10.243 --> 01:16:12.639
- until you hear from me, okay?
- Okay. Okay.


941
01:16:12.674 --> 01:16:14.476
- All right.
- Thank you so much.


942
01:16:14.511 --> 01:16:15.751
- I really appreciate it.
- Hey.


943
01:16:17.712 --> 01:16:19.019
Good job.

944
01:16:25.225 --> 01:16:27.324
Sheriff, I think
he's got something.


945
01:18:17.733 --> 01:18:19.172
What do you want from me?

946
01:18:19.207 --> 01:18:20.701
<i>Remember me?</i>

947
01:18:28.843 --> 01:18:31.613
I've done everything you want!
What do you want from me?


948
01:18:31.648 --> 01:18:32.746
<i>Remember me?</i>

949
01:18:37.918 --> 01:18:39.522
<i>Remember me?</i>

950
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:42.855
<i>Remember me?</i>

951
01:18:50.634 --> 01:18:51.864
Who did this to you?

952
01:18:52.735 --> 01:18:54.141
Who did this to you?

953
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:57.177
<i>You did.</i>

954
01:19:02.646 --> 01:19:03.744
I didn't do it.

955
01:19:04.879 --> 01:19:06.417
<i>You did.</i>

956
01:19:06.452 --> 01:19:08.353
<i>- You did.
- You did.</i>


957
01:19:08.388 --> 01:19:10.916
<i>- You did.
- You did.</i>


958
01:19:10.951 --> 01:19:12.654
<i>- You did.
- You did.</i>


959
01:19:12.689 --> 01:19:19.562
<i>You did.</i>

960
01:19:51.299 --> 01:19:54.465
Michael. Michael Lane.

961
01:19:56.766 --> 01:20:00.603
Hi. My name's Michael.
My name's Michael Lane.


962
01:20:02.508 --> 01:20:04.574
Nice to meet you.
I'm Michael Lane.


963
01:20:05.907 --> 01:20:07.676
Yeah. I just, um...

964
01:20:07.711 --> 01:20:09.791
I just moved here from
a little town called Woodbine.


965
01:20:10.513 --> 01:20:13.418
It's so small, it doesn't
even show up in the GPS.


966
01:20:15.488 --> 01:20:17.224
It's been hard to meet people.

967
01:20:18.491 --> 01:20:20.425
But it's given me
time to work on my novel.


968
01:20:22.726 --> 01:20:24.462
No kidding.
You're a writer too?


969
01:20:27.027 --> 01:20:28.598
I'd love to read your stuff.

970
01:20:32.736 --> 01:20:33.900
It's a date.

971
01:20:34.302 --> 01:20:36.382
I hope you're not getting
the wrong impression of me.


972
01:20:36.711 --> 01:20:39.246
Just so you know,
I normally don't invite guys


973
01:20:39.281 --> 01:20:40.841
to my place
after meeting online.


974
01:20:41.243 --> 01:20:43.316
I could never
think that about you.


975
01:20:43.685 --> 01:20:46.583
Actually,
I haven't had much success


976
01:20:46.618 --> 01:20:48.948
with this whole
internet dating thing.


977
01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:53.854
Really?
A beautiful girl like you.


978
01:20:55.957 --> 01:20:57.495
But I have to say, it's...

979
01:20:58.498 --> 01:21:02.401
so refreshing to
finally connect with someone.


980
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:05.536
I've always felt more
connected to small town people.


981
01:21:07.507 --> 01:21:09.387
Well, they don't get
much smaller than Woodbine.


982
01:21:09.844 --> 01:21:11.740
We just got
a McDonald's last year.


983
01:21:11.775 --> 01:21:14.380
Are all the guys from
Woodbine as charming as you?


984
01:21:15.449 --> 01:21:16.514
All six of us.

985
01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:21.783
Well, lucky for me, one of them
decided to move out here.


986
01:21:22.588 --> 01:21:23.653
No.

987
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:25.655
Lucky for me.

988
01:21:28.429 --> 01:21:31.463
Where are my manners?
Would you like a glass of wine?


989
01:21:32.092 --> 01:21:33.366
I'd love one.

990
01:21:33.768 --> 01:21:35.533
It's my first medieval thriller.

991
01:21:36.404 --> 01:21:37.436
<i>Knight Fire.</i>

992
01:21:38.439 --> 01:21:39.735
Well, the knight's the hero.

993
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:40.835
Of course.

994
01:21:43.411 --> 01:21:46.280
I'd love your opinion.
You'd be the first to read it.


995
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.711
I'd be honored.

996
01:21:51.045 --> 01:21:53.045
That's okay. Red or white?

997
01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.387
Let's see.

998
01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:58.556
Hmm. We'll go with the white.

999
01:22:00.692 --> 01:22:02.329
I hate it when
the red stains my coat.


1000
01:22:54.141 --> 01:22:56.515
Oh, my God.
Please don't hurt me.


1001
01:23:02.017 --> 01:23:03.390
Almost there.

1002
01:23:11.631 --> 01:23:12.762
Help me.

1003
01:23:28.175 --> 01:23:29.449
Bitch.

1004
01:24:07.016 --> 01:24:08.455
Hey, Katherine.

1005
01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:09.984
<i>Hi, Michael.</i>

1006
01:24:10.019 --> 01:24:11.739
<i>I thought I was
going to get your voicemail.</i>


1007
01:24:13.693 --> 01:24:17.156
No, you...
you get the real thing.


1008
01:24:17.191 --> 01:24:18.795
<i>Look, I know you're busy</i>

1009
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:20.599
<i>and I just wanted to say</i>

1010
01:24:20.634 --> 01:24:24.603
<i>that this has been
the best week of my life.</i>


1011
01:24:24.638 --> 01:24:26.033
<i>I can't wait to
see you tomorrow.</i>


1012
01:24:26.068 --> 01:24:30.510
<i>Yeah, me too.
I've got big plans.</i>


1013
01:24:30.545 --> 01:24:34.206
<i>Well, um, have a good night.
I'll be thinking of you.</i>


1014
01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:35.548
Me too.

1015
01:24:38.817 --> 01:24:39.915
Shit.

1016
01:25:55.025 --> 01:25:59.126
Michael. Michael. Michael.

1017
01:26:11.811 --> 01:26:12.876
Michael.

1018
01:27:13.972 --> 01:27:15.675
Hello?

1019
01:27:15.710 --> 01:27:17.369
<i>Hey. I was thinking of you.</i>

1020
01:27:19.978 --> 01:27:24.915
That's good.
Um, who am I?


1021
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.753
<i>Um, you're Mr. 
Wonderful.</i>

1022
01:27:27.788 --> 01:27:30.690
No, I'm... I'm...
I'm serious.


1023
01:27:31.759 --> 01:27:32.824
I don't...

1024
01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.387
I don't know where I am.

1025
01:27:35.422 --> 01:27:39.193
I believe you were
the last person I spoke to.


1026
01:27:41.197 --> 01:27:43.230
I... I don't remember anything.

1027
01:27:43.265 --> 01:27:44.330
<i>You're serious?</i>

1028
01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.136
What's going on?

1029
01:27:50.008 --> 01:27:51.447
<i>Where are you?
I'll be right there.</i>


1030
01:28:53.808 --> 01:28:55.841
Congratulations, Connor.

1031
01:28:56.778 --> 01:28:58.877
You finally got it.

1032
01:28:59.412 --> 01:29:01.979
You've come
to the end of your story.


1033
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:09.118
I told you, you had it in you,

1034
01:29:09.653 --> 01:29:11.285
but you didn't believe me.

1035
01:29:15.962 --> 01:29:17.291
I'm coming, Lucas.

1036
01:29:17.326 --> 01:29:19.095
Yes.

1037
01:29:19.664 --> 01:29:21.900
And you are
the visionary, Connor.


1038
01:29:26.203 --> 01:29:29.501
Katherine is the final brush
stroke in your masterpiece.


1039
01:29:33.177 --> 01:29:35.914
That's what you
intended four years ago.


1040
01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:38.510
But better late
than never, right?


1041
01:29:40.514 --> 01:29:43.119
Shoot her! Right in the head.

1042
01:29:45.387 --> 01:29:49.026
You're the visionary. Hurry.

1043
01:29:49.061 --> 01:29:50.291
We don't have much time.

1044
01:29:59.203 --> 01:30:02.270
Michael. What are you doing?

1045
01:30:02.872 --> 01:30:05.944
Don't worry.
I'll make it quick.


1046
01:30:05.979 --> 01:30:07.242
Not like the others.

1047
01:30:08.344 --> 01:30:10.542
No time for tittle title.

1048
01:30:10.577 --> 01:30:12.016
She can't live!

1049
01:30:12.051 --> 01:30:14.282
You have to
finish what you started!


1050
01:30:15.351 --> 01:30:17.824
Kill her! Kill her!

1051
01:30:18.486 --> 01:30:20.057
You have to end it!

1052
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:28.494
Kill her! Kill her!

1053
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:53.618
<i>Connor Lucas. 
It's the police.</i>

1054
01:30:53.653 --> 01:30:57.457
<i>The place is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.</i>


1055
01:30:57.492 --> 01:30:59.624
<i>I repeat,
come out with your hands up.</i>


1056
01:30:59.659 --> 01:31:02.132
Kitty Kat!

1057
01:31:09.442 --> 01:31:12.912
Kitty Kat!

1058
01:31:15.477 --> 01:31:16.982
<i>Target is on the move.</i>

1059
01:31:41.272 --> 01:31:44.273
<i>I'm locked on target.
Waiting on your command.</i>


1060
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.927
Michael, please don't hurt me.

1061
01:32:03.558 --> 01:32:06.394
- Michael, don't, don't, don't
- Police! Open up!


1062
01:32:06.429 --> 01:32:09.133
- Michael! No! No!
- Police! Open up!


1063
01:32:09.168 --> 01:32:10.398
Come right now

1064
01:32:10.767 --> 01:32:13.104
Go. Go. Go. Go.

1065
01:32:14.404 --> 01:32:15.469
No!

1066
01:32:50.473 --> 01:32:53.342
You are a waste
of skin and bone.


1067
01:32:55.412 --> 01:32:58.380
Like to drag you behind
my squad car.


1068
01:32:58.949 --> 01:33:01.647
From downtown.
Real slow, like a parade.


1069
01:33:05.257 --> 01:33:06.520
You're a piece of shit.

1070
01:33:10.064 --> 01:33:12.394
We had some trouble
connecting the dots


1071
01:33:12.429 --> 01:33:14.109
of these crimes from
all the jurisdictions.


1072
01:33:17.137 --> 01:33:19.302
But the puzzle
pieces fit perfectly now.


1073
01:33:23.374 --> 01:33:24.516
I've got
a question for you, Connor.


1074
01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:25.704
Yeah.

1075
01:33:26.273 --> 01:33:28.443
Did you ever think about
the families of the victims?


1076
01:33:29.776 --> 01:33:31.050
All the time.

1077
01:33:32.416 --> 01:33:33.481
That was half the fun.

1078
01:33:43.064 --> 01:33:44.525
There's nothing I'd rather do

1079
01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.693
than put you down
like rabid dog you are.


1080
01:33:50.302 --> 01:33:53.006
Save the county
the cost of your trial.


1081
01:33:53.308 --> 01:33:54.370
Do it.

1082
01:34:00.081 --> 01:34:03.643
But unlike you,
I don't fancy myself a judge,


1083
01:34:03.678 --> 01:34:05.216
jury and executioner.

1084
01:34:05.251 --> 01:34:06.448
No, you're just a pussy.

1085
01:34:07.847 --> 01:34:09.319
You're a fucking embarrassment.

1086
01:34:09.788 --> 01:34:12.388
You got your little brown
shirt and you khaki pants,


1087
01:34:12.423 --> 01:34:14.720
and your big shiny
badge and your pistol.


1088
01:34:14.755 --> 01:34:16.491
You can't shoot to kill.

1089
01:34:17.329 --> 01:34:18.625
You have no idea.

1090
01:34:20.167 --> 01:34:21.265
About the thrill.

1091
01:34:22.697 --> 01:34:24.367
About the rush...

1092
01:34:25.436 --> 01:34:27.040
of taking a human life.

1093
01:34:28.208 --> 01:34:31.176
Only two people
know that. Two people.


1094
01:34:33.312 --> 01:34:35.114
God and me.

1095
01:34:35.549 --> 01:34:36.709
You're insane.

1096
01:34:37.411 --> 01:34:42.451
All that's left,
is to flush you away forever,


1097
01:34:42.486 --> 01:34:44.189
like the piece of shit you are.

1098
01:34:46.325 --> 01:34:48.160
You sure about that, sheriff?

1099
01:34:50.263 --> 01:34:52.197
Because I'm just
getting started.


1100
01:35:23.263 --> 01:35:24.383
Get him out of here.

1101
01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.232
And let him rot in the hole.

1102
01:35:27.267 --> 01:35:29.564
Haha. He got it bad for you.

1103
01:35:29.599 --> 01:35:31.302
Good luck surviving the year.

1104
01:35:31.337 --> 01:35:33.205
I give this dickhead two months.

1105
01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.702
It's a high price on
his head. He's good as dead.


1106
01:35:35.737 --> 01:35:37.374
How much you say it is again?

1107
01:35:41.578 --> 01:35:43.380
Call back up. Call back up.

1108
01:35:43.415 --> 01:35:44.590
Shots fired. Shots fired.

1109
01:35:50.257 --> 01:35:53.720
I've been shot. Back up.
