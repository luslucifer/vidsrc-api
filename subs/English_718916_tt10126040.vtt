00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:06.354
<i>This is me.</i>

2
00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:09.691
- Oh, yeah!
- <i>No, not this guy.</i>


3
00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:12.327
Oh, yeah. Oh, don't stop!

4
00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:15.431
- Oh, my God!
- <i>This guy.</i>


5
00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:16.766
Oh, my God!

6
00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:18.333
Oh, right there!

7
00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:22.071
Oh, yeah!

8
00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.774
I... I'm gonna...

9
00:01:24.806 --> 00:01:26.775
<i>I kind of wanted
to freeze to death that day.</i>


10
00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:28.611
Tim Long, no!

11
00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:31.313
<i>I even fantasized
about a headline.</i>


12
00:01:31.346 --> 00:01:33.649
<i>"Teenage Genius Dies
In Blizzard".</i>


13
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:35.183
<i>But in truth, 
I knew my death</i>

14
00:01:35.217 --> 00:01:39.455
<i>would make one paragraph
on page 12 at best.</i>


15
00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:42.325
<i>I grew up in what is technically
known among geographers</i>


16
00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:44.326
<i>as the middle
of fucking nowhere,</i>


17
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.863
<i>in a town whose mascot
was this guy.</i>


18
00:01:46.896 --> 00:01:48.698
<i>The white squirrel.</i>

19
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.634
<i>Now, white squirrels have a recessive
gene that makes them super rare...</i>


20
00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:54.670
<i>And super dumb.</i>

21
00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:57.240
<i>And in 1986,</i>

22
00:01:57.273 --> 00:02:00.610
<i>when the town was in the midst
of a crippling recession,</i>


23
00:02:00.643 --> 00:02:02.779
<i>Hobart and the squirrel
had a lot in common.</i>


24
00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:10.352
<i>They were both throwbacks
on the verge of extinction,</i>


25
00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:12.889
<i>struggling to fight off
stronger competitors,</i>


26
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:14.790
<i>and almost totally white.</i>

27
00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:24.400
Tim, come on!

28
00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:27.670
Yeah, it's tough
for everybody right now.


29
00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:29.806
Did you hear about
Robertson's variety?


30
00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:33.542
You know Doug Robertson,
no head for business.


31
00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:35.545
Tim, Mom's waiting!

32
00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:36.955
That's what you said
about Stedman Shoes


33
00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.415
and they've been in business
for 60 years, right?


34
00:02:40.748 --> 00:02:42.551
Hey, buddy!

35
00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:44.154
Hey.

36
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.256
Yeah.

37
00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.401
You know, you don't got to go to
the parade meeting with your mom.


38
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:52.461
You can always head down
to the rink and, uh,


39
00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:55.297
I don't know, hang out
with your friends.


40
00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:06.441
Why'd you have
to mention friends?


41
00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:18.587
I spy with my little eye
something that starts with a C.


42
00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:20.490
Car?

43
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:22.624
Yeah.

44
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.230
<i>Hobart's annual
white squirrel parade</i>


45
00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:28.498
<i>was the most embarrassing</i>

46
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.833
<i>and culturally cringeworthy
event imaginable...</i>


47
00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:33.435
<i>Unless you are four years old,</i>

48
00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.472
<i>or Kevin, the parade organizer.</i>

49
00:03:36.504 --> 00:03:40.008
Come with me, if you will,

50
00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:41.576
on a...

51
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.845
On a journey

52
00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:45.581
- through the mists of time.
- Whoa.


53
00:03:45.613 --> 00:03:48.718
Let the years roll back
before your eyes.


54
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.286
The '70s turn into the '60s.

55
00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:53.888
Groovy.

56
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.357
Right on.

57
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:57.227
The '50s, Elvis...

58
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:00.762
The '40s, Korea...

59
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.499
Back and back and back we go...

60
00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:07.736
It's 1939.

61
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.474
The Nazis are cutting
a swath through Europe.


62
00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:14.409
Jews and gypsies are
murdered indiscriminately.


63
00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:16.011
Ooh.

64
00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:18.485
And the Toronto Maple Leafs have
won their second Stanley Cup.


65
00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:20.016
Yeah!

66
00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.384
- Yeah!
- Yeah!


67
00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:24.920
I propose this year,

68
00:04:24.953 --> 00:04:28.791
we recreate Hobart's very first

69
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.927
white squirrel parade.

70
00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:34.929
I'm sorry, why are there Nazis?

71
00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:36.932
There won't be actual Nazis,

72
00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:38.801
it was just
for historical context.


73
00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.304
Um, before we commit
to any one theme,


74
00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:43.905
we should maybe look at cost.

75
00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.641
Cut back a little.

76
00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:46.909
Hell, no.

77
00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:51.981
You know who cuts corners
on their town fairs?


78
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.583
Wingham.

79
00:04:55.617 --> 00:04:57.552
I think that Sheila has a point.

80
00:04:57.586 --> 00:04:59.588
I mean,
money is so tight these days.


81
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.991
Maybe we can cut back
on the snow removal,


82
00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:05.061
or the daycare hours
at the old folks home.


83
00:05:05.093 --> 00:05:07.663
But what about the theme?
Retro vintage!


84
00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:10.700
Okay, I think that the parade is
really important to a lot of people.


85
00:05:10.732 --> 00:05:12.834
So, why don't we just all
put our thinking caps on


86
00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:14.703
and, uh,
we'll discuss it next week.


87
00:05:14.737 --> 00:05:17.439
I tell you what,
why don't we put our thinking caps on,


88
00:05:17.473 --> 00:05:18.807
just discuss it next week.

89
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.343
I know the parade is really
important to everyone.


90
00:05:21.377 --> 00:05:22.977
- That's a great idea, Gary.
- Thank you.


91
00:05:25.047 --> 00:05:26.949
<i>While my schoolmates
were at the rink,</i>


92
00:05:26.982 --> 00:05:29.985
<i>I sought solace in the company
of our Town Hall janitor.</i>


93
00:05:30.018 --> 00:05:31.354
Hello.

94
00:05:31.386 --> 00:05:32.721
I, uh, couldn't decide between.

95
00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:35.624
<i>Yojimbo, Subway</i>
and <i>La Dolce Vita,</i>


96
00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:38.060
so I brought them all.

97
00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:41.564
What was that again?

98
00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:43.099
You told me you'd bought
a VCR player,


99
00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:45.867
so I thought I'd bring
some movies.


100
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:47.703
I don't care much for movies.

101
00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:48.870
Right, sure.

102
00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:50.773
But, in case you change
your mind,


103
00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:53.141
I'm gonna leave these here.

104
00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:55.110
Movies from all around
the world,


105
00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:56.778
including one from Korea.

106
00:05:56.812 --> 00:06:00.148
I shot my best friend in Korea.

107
00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:02.384
Used his body for shelter.

108
00:06:04.686 --> 00:06:06.722
Okay.

109
00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:09.658
I... I didn't know that, I'm sorry.
I'll take that one out.


110
00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:11.828
Farewell, <i>The Housemaid.</i>

111
00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:15.665
There's a tampon blocking
the drain pipe.


112
00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:18.367
I'll see you later.

113
00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:21.069
Yeah, okay.

114
00:06:22.771 --> 00:06:24.172
Good luck with the, uh...

115
00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:26.109
Good luck with the...
With the tampon.


116
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.413
You were really
impressive in there, Gary.


117
00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.014
You have such a way with words.

118
00:06:33.047 --> 00:06:35.518
Thank you for keeping
Tim company.


119
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:38.052
Careful, it's the Crowfoots.

120
00:06:38.086 --> 00:06:39.554
What can I do for you, sir?

121
00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:40.623
Gun permit.

122
00:06:40.655 --> 00:06:42.525
- Downstairs to the left...
- Oops! Sorry!


123
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:45.927
I heard the sister
doesn't even talk.


124
00:06:46.727 --> 00:06:47.896
Hi, Tim Long!

125
00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:49.965
Look, same sweater!

126
00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:53.502
See?

127
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.446
Hey, Long.

128
00:07:03.478 --> 00:07:04.579
How's your book?

129
00:07:05.814 --> 00:07:07.617
Uh, it's... It's not a book,

130
00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:09.018
it's a magazine.

131
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.087
Yeah? Are you gonna fuck it?

132
00:07:13.956 --> 00:07:15.825
How exactly would I do that?

133
00:07:15.857 --> 00:07:17.660
I don't know, man,
you're the one who's gay.


134
00:07:19.894 --> 00:07:21.863
Why is the magazine a man?

135
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.537
Dude, Fleming's coming.
We gotta go.

Wait, hold on.

151
00:08:11.013 --> 00:08:12.581
I just wanna talk to you about

this France-Canada
exchange program.

This is a really great way
to expand your horizons.


154

A super-duper way

learn about the world,
make sure your parents see this, too.

It's good.

182
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.346
You didn't respond to the, uh,
joke about the Pope in the dress.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.445
Huh?

319
00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:20.315
You did not say
you live in a palace.


320
00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:23.485
How many families live here?

321
00:19:23.518 --> 00:19:24.720
Just us, Stephane.

322
00:19:27.288 --> 00:19:28.323
Huh.

323
00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:29.458
Wow.

324
00:19:33.461 --> 00:19:34.595
Big wow.

325
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.400
Well, um,
this is your room, so...


326
00:19:38.432 --> 00:19:39.800
This is all me?

327
00:19:39.834 --> 00:19:42.370
Yeah. No, it's all you.

328
00:19:42.403 --> 00:19:45.874
Wow. Big wow.

329
00:19:45.906 --> 00:19:49.211
Yeah. Used to be, uh,
kinda my private retreat.


330
00:19:49.243 --> 00:19:51.579
Where I'd get away
from it all. Uh...


331
00:19:51.613 --> 00:19:53.715
It's all yours now,
so you're welcome.


332
00:19:54.548 --> 00:19:55.951
These are your friends?

333
00:19:55.983 --> 00:19:58.919
- My... No, no, not my friends.
- They look sad.


334
00:19:58.952 --> 00:20:00.955
- Uh, they're The Smiths.
- Huh?


335
00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:04.326
Great new band out of England.
Very smart, very cool...


336
00:20:04.358 --> 00:20:05.559
You know, I don't like this.

337
00:20:05.593 --> 00:20:07.629
I like, uh, you know, hip-hop?

338
00:20:07.662 --> 00:20:08.963
Sure, yeah, okay.

339
00:20:08.997 --> 00:20:11.533
Actually, I read a great
article about how rap...


340
00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:12.968
<i>♪ Don't push me</i>

341
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.536
<i>♪ 'Cause I'm close to the edge</i>

342
00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:16.337
Okay. Yeah.

343
00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:19.708
<i>♪ I'm trying
not to lose my head ♪</i>


344
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.244
Yeah. No. Maybe not the vase.

345
00:20:23.278 --> 00:20:26.514
Very delicate.
My nana bought me that from Venice.


346
00:20:26.547 --> 00:20:28.450
- Pop that there.
- Hello.


347
00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:29.984
You boys getting along?

348
00:20:30.785 --> 00:20:32.354
We are <i>meilleurs copains.</i>

349
00:20:32.386 --> 00:20:33.754
- Yeah.
- Best friends.


350
00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:36.423
- Aww...
- Yeah.


351
00:20:36.457 --> 00:20:38.793
- Yeah, it's going great.
- I can see that.


352
00:20:38.826 --> 00:20:42.998
I brought you something.
It's called a bean bag chair.


353
00:20:45.032 --> 00:20:46.700
It's full of beans, like me.

354
00:20:49.671 --> 00:20:52.374
- She very funny.
- Yes. Yeah, very funny, Mom.


355
00:20:52.406 --> 00:20:53.407
I'll leave you to it.

356
00:20:55.509 --> 00:20:57.246
Tell you something, Tim.

357
00:20:58.613 --> 00:21:00.481
This is my best life.

358
00:21:01.382 --> 00:21:02.384
Lot of fun.

359
00:21:03.418 --> 00:21:04.519
Lot of fun.

360
00:21:06.386 --> 00:21:08.922
Well, uh, the couch folds out
into a bed,


361
00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:12.026
so you can feel free to get
on that, watch some movies.


362
00:21:12.059 --> 00:21:14.361
TV here is great. Records.

363
00:21:14.394 --> 00:21:15.830
- Hey, Tim. Tim.
- Music. Yeah.


364
00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:18.767
Soft like a woman, huh?

365
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:20.835
- Oh, yeah.
- Like this?


366
00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:23.804
<i>Comme ca? Comme ca.</i>

367
00:21:23.837 --> 00:21:26.674
- Huh?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do some of that.


368
00:21:26.708 --> 00:21:28.442
- Like this? Leg up?
- Oh.


369
00:21:28.476 --> 00:21:29.643
Yeah.

370
00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:31.413
That's great, yeah.

371
00:21:31.445 --> 00:21:32.913
Maybe like this, no hands?

372
00:21:32.947 --> 00:21:35.350
Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay.

373
00:21:35.383 --> 00:21:37.586
- Yes.
- Yeah, up and down.


374
00:21:38.786 --> 00:21:40.388
- Perfect.
- You try it now.


375
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:42.590
- No.
- Soft like woman.


376
00:21:42.623 --> 00:21:44.926
Yeah. Or like a...
Lile a big old marshmallow.


377
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.898
Like a marshmallow.

378
00:21:55.603 --> 00:21:56.837
Good.

379
00:21:56.871 --> 00:21:59.007
Yeah, it's a lot of fun. Yeah.

380
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:03.644
Stephane, school is at 8:30.

381
00:22:04.945 --> 00:22:08.415
I am already ready. Huh?

382
00:22:08.449 --> 00:22:11.653
Already ready. Already ready.
This is fun to say, eh?


383
00:22:11.685 --> 00:22:13.688
Bring the milk.
Toast on the table.


384
00:22:16.156 --> 00:22:19.493
Am I crazy, or are his pants
totally diaphanous?


385
00:22:19.527 --> 00:22:21.830
- Dia-what?
- They're see-through. His pants are...


386
00:22:23.064 --> 00:22:24.666
- Dad.
- Hello.


387
00:22:26.401 --> 00:22:29.403
Morning, boys.
Who wants French toast?


388
00:22:29.436 --> 00:22:31.972
Or I guess you
would just call it toast.

389
00:22:33.708 --> 00:22:35.410
Mmm. Hmm.

390
00:22:35.442 --> 00:22:37.546
Glenn, I would like to tell you,

391
00:22:38.578 --> 00:22:39.947
you are so smart

392
00:22:40.815 --> 00:22:43.751
and so success, huh.

393
00:22:43.785 --> 00:22:46.888
You are, and Sheila, wow,
you are so beautiful.


394
00:22:46.921 --> 00:22:48.056
- Huh.
- Oh!


395
00:22:48.088 --> 00:22:50.358
- Yeah.
- Corn Flakes, please.


396
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:56.765
Hmm...

397
00:22:59.534 --> 00:23:02.070
Maybe you should
change your pants,


398
00:23:02.103 --> 00:23:04.940
because you can see right
through them.


399
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.976
- Can you really?
- Not at all.


400
00:23:09.009 --> 00:23:11.445
- Whole outfit's terrific.
- Yeah, it's great.


401
00:23:11.479 --> 00:23:13.414
- It's very chic.
- Very smart.


402
00:23:13.448 --> 00:23:15.816
<i>I talked Stephane
into changing his trousers,</i>


403
00:23:15.849 --> 00:23:18.118
<i>but I couldn't change him.</i>

404
00:23:18.152 --> 00:23:20.756
<i>I dreaded walking to school
with him that first day.</i>


405
00:23:22.623 --> 00:23:24.826
This place is like, uh...
What is that movie?


406
00:23:24.858 --> 00:23:26.560
Uh, <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

407
00:23:27.894 --> 00:23:29.830
Trust me,
inside it's a nightmare.


408
00:23:29.864 --> 00:23:30.965
What? What nightmare?

409
00:23:30.998 --> 00:23:34.035
Hello, teachers.
Hello, fellow pupils.


410
00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:36.837
Hello, girl with
the pink hat on.


411
00:23:36.871 --> 00:23:40.041
- I love this school. I go this school now.
- Yeah.


412
00:23:41.576 --> 00:23:42.677
Please stop speaking.

413
00:23:44.511 --> 00:23:47.848
Boys, I don't know
what a cooch-gobbler even is...


414
00:23:47.882 --> 00:23:50.051
but I'm pretty sure that.

415
00:23:50.084 --> 00:23:53.020
Mrs. McConnell doesn't want it
scrawled all over her Subaru.


416
00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:55.589
Stephane, Mrs. Fleming.

417
00:23:55.623 --> 00:23:58.826
- <i>Allo.</i>
- Oh, oh.


418
00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:01.562
- Uh, that's the vice principal.
- Ah.


419
00:24:01.595 --> 00:24:03.530
And she also teaches French.

420
00:24:03.564 --> 00:24:05.967
And she, um,
is more or less mayor.


421
00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:08.202
Whoa! She very important, ah?

422
00:24:08.236 --> 00:24:10.905
No. Not really.
It's just Hobart, so...


423
00:24:10.938 --> 00:24:12.707
Uh, here. That's his paperwork.

424
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.642
I'll get out of your hair.
See you.


425
00:24:14.674 --> 00:24:17.211
Boys, I'll see you at lunch.

426
00:24:17.245 --> 00:24:19.781
Bye, cool guys.
I go this school now.


427
00:24:21.848 --> 00:24:23.851
We're glad you're here,
Stephane.


428
00:24:23.884 --> 00:24:25.252
Um...

429
00:24:25.286 --> 00:24:27.188
I know you had
a bit of a rough time at home,


430
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.724
but you can start with a clean
slate here at Hobart High.


431
00:24:30.758 --> 00:24:33.228
It's good, huh.
Hobart are number one.


432
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.997
Oh, go, the fighting white squirrel.

433
00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:40.868
<i>Salut.</i>

434
00:24:40.902 --> 00:24:42.604
You are a teacher here?

435
00:24:42.636 --> 00:24:45.639
Oh. No. Well, not yet.

436
00:24:48.442 --> 00:24:51.712
Well, I've applied to teacher's college,
and I'm still waiting to hear back.


437
00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:53.215
It's kind of a long story.

438
00:24:57.084 --> 00:24:58.086
Okay.

439
00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:00.055
<i>Allo.</i>

440
00:25:00.887 --> 00:25:02.155
Begin.

441
00:25:02.189 --> 00:25:04.292
Oh, um...

442
00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:06.928
Well, uh...

443
00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:12.599
I had the best teacher in kindergarten,
Mrs. Johannson, and she was just so kind


444
00:25:12.633 --> 00:25:14.969
and really like a second mom
to me in a lot of ways.


445
00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:16.503
That's 'cause her
real mom left town,


446
00:25:16.537 --> 00:25:20.607
and things got tough, and her dad
started hitting the sauce pretty hard,


447
00:25:20.641 --> 00:25:22.886
and she was forced to move in
with her auntie across town,


448
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:26.114
which basically made her
mega-into teachers, which,


449
00:25:26.146 --> 00:25:28.649
of course, is good for me.

450
00:25:28.682 --> 00:25:31.251
Sorry, honey,
just saving us a lot of time.


451
00:25:31.285 --> 00:25:36.624
Gary, um, this is Stephane,
he is the exchange student from France.


452
00:25:36.656 --> 00:25:39.059
Sure, why wouldn't he be?
Gary Rothbauer.


453
00:25:39.093 --> 00:25:40.327
Gary's a gym teacher.

454
00:25:40.361 --> 00:25:41.296
Hmm.

455
00:25:41.328 --> 00:25:44.298
- Gary's also the local law enforcement.
- Mmm.


456
00:25:44.332 --> 00:25:45.233
Part-time.

457
00:25:45.267 --> 00:25:47.335
Um, the real sheriff's
based in Wingham.


458
00:25:47.367 --> 00:25:48.368
Wingham's 20 miles away,

459
00:25:48.403 --> 00:25:51.772
so shit hits the fan,
I'm the first responder.


460
00:25:51.806 --> 00:25:54.208
I also teach skating,
hockey, and soccer.


461
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.044
You play soccer here?

462
00:25:56.076 --> 00:25:57.278
Does the Pope wear a dress?

463
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.780
He does.

464
00:25:59.814 --> 00:26:01.615
Yes, he does.

465
00:26:02.282 --> 00:26:03.317
Really?

466
00:26:03.351 --> 00:26:04.886
Huh?

467
00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:07.689
See? International.
My jokes are international.


468
00:26:07.721 --> 00:26:10.357
May not look like it,
but he's one of us. Huh?


469
00:26:10.391 --> 00:26:13.728
I like this guy. All right.
Listen, word to the wise.


470
00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:17.698
- Oh.
- Oh.


471
00:26:17.731 --> 00:26:19.600
Uh, just leave it.

472
00:26:19.634 --> 00:26:21.268
You may hear
people talking about


473
00:26:21.301 --> 00:26:24.237
me being the greatest hockey player
to ever come out of this town.


474
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.839
Played in pro-hockey, son.

475
00:26:25.873 --> 00:26:28.843
Power forward, 15 games.

476
00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:32.980
But the coach was an arsehole,
and who needs all the travel?


477
00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:36.617
I love soccer.

478
00:26:37.351 --> 00:26:40.855
I scored 20 goals in 20 games.

479
00:26:40.887 --> 00:26:42.122
- Wow.
- Not bad.


480
00:26:42.155 --> 00:26:44.259
Not bad at all.

481
00:26:45.358 --> 00:26:48.095
If you wanna play,
practice is at 2:00.


482
00:26:48.128 --> 00:26:49.763
- You can try for the team.
- <i>Oui?</i>


483
00:26:49.797 --> 00:26:52.033
Now, I'm firm, but I'm fair,

484
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.304
and, uh, I don't see color.

485
00:26:57.805 --> 00:26:59.740
Oh, no.

486
00:26:59.774 --> 00:27:02.010
You should,
uh, go see the doctor.


487
00:27:02.043 --> 00:27:03.144
- Why?
- Stephane.


488
00:27:05.078 --> 00:27:07.781
- Bye-bye. See you.
- Bye.


489
00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:09.217
Goodbye, queen of the office.

490
00:27:12.787 --> 00:27:13.787
Sweet kid.

491
00:27:15.855 --> 00:27:18.660
- Copier's out of paper.
- Sure, I'll get on that.


492
00:27:20.027 --> 00:27:23.030
<i>I had absolutely no idea
what to expect</i>


493
00:27:23.064 --> 00:27:24.932
<i>from Stephane's first day
at Hobart High.</i>


494
00:27:25.732 --> 00:27:26.900
<i>How he'd make out.</i>

495
00:27:26.933 --> 00:27:29.302
<i>Who would he antagonize?
What would he hump?</i>


496
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.980
<i>But what
I didn't expect was this.</i>


497
00:27:47.488 --> 00:27:50.158
<i>He joined more
sports teams than me, one...</i>


498
00:27:55.362 --> 00:27:57.297
<i>And made more friends than me.</i>

499
00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.334
<i>So, it was infuriating.</i>

500
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:12.879
And I had the idea for
<i>Star Wars</i> way before it came out.


501
00:28:12.913 --> 00:28:14.153
There was no point in pursuing.

502
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:15.984
Lose all the money
to lawyers and...


503
00:28:19.252 --> 00:28:21.221
And the lion spots his prey

504
00:28:22.256 --> 00:28:23.391
and moves in for the kill.

505
00:28:24.258 --> 00:28:26.227
Come on, Gary, I'm tired.

506
00:28:26.259 --> 00:28:27.961
Maybe we can go...

507
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:30.832
Woof yourself.

508
00:28:32.199 --> 00:28:34.201
- Dick.
- I'll just wait here.


509
00:28:36.002 --> 00:28:37.004
Oh, jeez.

510
00:28:38.172 --> 00:28:40.074
Is that nubuck, hmm?

511
00:28:40.106 --> 00:28:41.742
- No.
- Sure it is.


512
00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:44.444
You gotta work with me here.

513
00:28:44.478 --> 00:28:45.613
Gary, I'm dying here.

514
00:28:45.645 --> 00:28:48.482
You're dying? What is this,
a shoe store or Live Aid?


515
00:28:48.516 --> 00:28:49.951
I have a family to feed.

516
00:28:49.983 --> 00:28:51.785
They're only $20.

517
00:28:51.818 --> 00:28:52.820
Look at that.

518
00:28:55.122 --> 00:28:56.858
That's not good.

519
00:28:56.891 --> 00:29:00.762
I'll give you 16 because I like
you. I'm doing you a favor.


520
00:29:05.566 --> 00:29:07.468
Make it 12. I'll give you 12.

521
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.370
And, uh,
you got any other colors?


522
00:29:10.403 --> 00:29:12.740
I'm not taking the floor model.

523
00:29:15.009 --> 00:29:16.110
I'll check.

524
00:29:16.143 --> 00:29:17.345
Thank you, Robbie.

525
00:29:17.377 --> 00:29:19.446
You drive a hard bargain.

526
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.016
Your dad'll be proud.

527
00:29:22.048 --> 00:29:23.384
How's your day?

528
00:29:23.416 --> 00:29:25.886
Pfft! Ooh la la,
it's not so easy.


529
00:29:27.153 --> 00:29:29.989
Oh. Really?

530
00:29:30.024 --> 00:29:32.893
- Why?
- Well, everyone wants to talk to me.


531
00:29:32.926 --> 00:29:37.564
"Stephane. Come sit with me."
"Stephane, you're so cool."


532
00:29:37.597 --> 00:29:39.466
Come to my house,
watch T.J. Hooker.


533
00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:42.336
My head is pfft!
It's crazy, huh.


534
00:29:42.368 --> 00:29:44.871
- You know this problem?
- Sure.


535
00:29:44.904 --> 00:29:47.008
Real dilemma.

536
00:29:48.107 --> 00:29:49.143
Is that Diane?

537
00:29:49.175 --> 00:29:51.545
<i>Bonjour,</i> Diane.

538
00:29:51.578 --> 00:29:54.248
Oh, uh... I don't speak...
Sorry.


539
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.415
- Um...
- Huh?


540
00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:00.488
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

541
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.556
No, no, no.

542
00:30:08.028 --> 00:30:08.962
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

543
00:30:08.996 --> 00:30:12.033
Mr. Steadman, are you alive?
He's dead.


544
00:30:12.066 --> 00:30:13.542
- Are you alive. He's alive. Okay.
- Is he dead?


545
00:30:13.566 --> 00:30:14.367
Can you say something, please?

546
00:30:14.401 --> 00:30:16.170
Oh, my gosh, Mr. Steadman.

547
00:30:16.202 --> 00:30:17.337
I'm fine.

548
00:30:17.371 --> 00:30:19.207
- Thank you so much.
- Here, let me help you.


549
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.109
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me.


550
00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:24.245
What's going on?

551
00:30:24.278 --> 00:30:26.047
Stephane here
just saved my life.


552
00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:28.316
Oh, no, it's, uh, nothing.

553
00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:30.317
No, you did. Thank you.

554
00:30:30.351 --> 00:30:32.520
Nine and a half.

555
00:30:35.088 --> 00:30:38.992
<i>That night my parents wanted
to reward Stephane for his heroism</i>


556
00:30:39.026 --> 00:30:41.128
<i>by showing him
the best of Canadian cuisine.</i>


557
00:30:41.161 --> 00:30:43.364
- It's so good.
- <i>So, we went for a Chinese meal.</i>


558
00:30:43.396 --> 00:30:46.967
In France, this meal
costs one millions dollar.


559
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.202
- Canada, too.
- Oh.


560
00:30:49.236 --> 00:30:52.006
Hey, there he is.

561
00:30:52.306 --> 00:30:53.341
Herb DeVries.

562
00:30:53.374 --> 00:30:54.541
Stephane Belmadi.

563
00:30:54.575 --> 00:30:56.076
Is that right?

564
00:30:56.109 --> 00:30:57.211
How do you pronounce that?

565
00:30:57.243 --> 00:30:59.112
Stephane Bermady.

566
00:31:01.181 --> 00:31:02.583
No.

567
00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:08.355
So, uh, I heard you saved poor
little Diane Dearling's life today.


568
00:31:08.388 --> 00:31:09.623
Oh, no, no, no. It's nothing.

569
00:31:09.656 --> 00:31:12.092
<i>Bonjour,</i> hero of the hour.

570
00:31:12.125 --> 00:31:15.195
<i>Bonjour. Enchante...</i>

571
00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:21.369
Sheila,
can I bend your ear for a sec?


572
00:31:21.402 --> 00:31:24.971
Hello, anybody notice
we're eating here?


573
00:31:25.005 --> 00:31:29.377
You know, I've made a lot of progress
with our retro-vintage theme.


574
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.412
Kev, you know,
I love it when you think big.


575
00:31:31.444 --> 00:31:34.883
I just think that, you know, we need a
theme that's a little closer to home.


576
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.519
- Okay.
- Sorry. Not to hurt your feelings.


577
00:31:39.553 --> 00:31:41.556
- No. I can respect that.
- I'm sorry.


578
00:31:50.263 --> 00:31:53.233
Lightbulb alert. Stephane.

579
00:31:55.536 --> 00:31:58.672
Our theme is Stephane.

580
00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:01.975
Wait. You want the theme of the
parade to be Stephane?


581
00:32:02.476 --> 00:32:04.679
He's been here three days.

582
00:32:04.711 --> 00:32:06.413
Lorna, come over
and hear Kev's new plan.


583
00:32:06.447 --> 00:32:11.152
Well, not Stephane,
but Stephane.


584
00:32:11.617 --> 00:32:12.618
- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.


585
00:32:12.653 --> 00:32:16.022
- Who he is. What he represents.
- Yeah.


586
00:32:16.056 --> 00:32:20.528
- Hobart welcomes the world.
- Yeah.


587
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.297
International friendship!

588
00:32:23.329 --> 00:32:24.564
Yeah, that could work.

589
00:32:24.597 --> 00:32:26.533
- Eggrolls for everyone.
- Whoo!


590
00:32:26.566 --> 00:32:28.035
- Oh!
- Yeah!


591
00:32:28.067 --> 00:32:30.503
- Thanks, Glenn.
- Thank you.


592
00:32:49.288 --> 00:32:53.027
You know
who should join you? Dr. Moe.


593
00:32:54.127 --> 00:32:56.196
- Dr. Moe, the town dentist.
- Mmm-hmm.


594
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.265
Moe!

595
00:32:59.199 --> 00:33:00.268
Moe!

596
00:33:01.268 --> 00:33:02.269
Moe, look!

597
00:33:03.237 --> 00:33:05.272
- Huh?
- Huh?


598
00:33:05.305 --> 00:33:07.408
Where are you from, again?

599
00:33:07.441 --> 00:33:11.312
- Ottawa.
- No, he means where you're from-from?


600
00:33:12.413 --> 00:33:15.615
I was born in Egypt, but moved
when I was an infant.


601
00:33:15.649 --> 00:33:17.485
That's great.

602
00:33:17.518 --> 00:33:22.323
Stephane, you can be France
and Dr. Moe can be... Africa.


603
00:33:22.355 --> 00:33:24.191
No fucking way.

604
00:33:25.058 --> 00:33:27.228
Can you go talk to him
because...


605
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.706
I need both of you and he gets a
little moody and won't listen to me.


606
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.033
Hey! I can still hear you.

607
00:33:32.066 --> 00:33:34.535
He can still hear us
so just nod.


608
00:33:34.567 --> 00:33:36.436
Jesus! This fucking town.

609
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.105
That was great, eh?

610
00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:40.341
Oh, careful, honey.

611
00:33:42.076 --> 00:33:45.379
Do you know the English word,
grapefruit, huh?


612
00:33:45.412 --> 00:33:49.316
In French we have a word,
we call it a <i>pamplemousse.</i>


613
00:33:52.185 --> 00:33:55.355
<i>Pamplemousse</i> is a funny word, huh?

614
00:33:55.388 --> 00:33:59.526
Tim, I know he isn't,
uh, what you expected.


615
00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:01.828
Yeah. Understatement.

616
00:34:01.862 --> 00:34:04.365
Give it time. You know,
relationships can be tricky.


617
00:34:04.397 --> 00:34:05.499
I understand that.

618
00:34:05.532 --> 00:34:08.669
It's like a garden,
with attention and cultivation,


619
00:34:08.701 --> 00:34:09.803
good things can grow.

620
00:34:09.837 --> 00:34:12.206
We only got six egg rolls,

621
00:34:12.238 --> 00:34:14.808
- but you're charging us for eight.
- But if you look...


622
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:15.642
Glenn.

623
00:34:15.676 --> 00:34:17.678
You see, you have extra.

624
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:26.720
So, this is, uh,
your favorite movie?


625
00:34:27.321 --> 00:34:29.790
Oh, one of them. Yeah.

626
00:34:31.357 --> 00:34:33.461
Yeah. Plus, it's French.

627
00:34:33.493 --> 00:34:34.796
- So, you know...
- I see that.


628
00:34:38.866 --> 00:34:43.271
- We don't have to watch it.
- No, it's, uh... It's fine.


629
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.841
Maybe, uh,
we just sit and talk, huh?


630
00:34:47.875 --> 00:34:49.744
One to other, asking questions.

631
00:34:50.611 --> 00:34:53.681
- Yeah. Okay. Sure.
- Mmm.


632
00:34:54.848 --> 00:34:58.219
Um, okay, well...

633
00:34:58.852 --> 00:35:01.321
Tell me about Paris.
What's it like?


634
00:35:01.354 --> 00:35:04.224
Old. How many times
you make the fuck, Tim?


635
00:35:06.292 --> 00:35:09.296
- What?
- Two times? Three times?


636
00:35:09.328 --> 00:35:12.466
Five times? Twenty-five times,
you dirty boy, huh?


637
00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:13.868
- Busy boy.
- Please!


638
00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:16.470
Can you tell me
anything about Paris?


639
00:35:16.502 --> 00:35:19.606
Just tell me about the Louvre,
the Champs-Elysees, anything.


640
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.176
That is tourist Paris.

641
00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:25.212
It's, uh, not my Paris.

642
00:35:29.448 --> 00:35:30.817
My Paris is not so great.

643
00:35:34.321 --> 00:35:35.422
Oh.

644
00:35:36.323 --> 00:35:38.859
So, uh, tomorrow we meet
your friends, huh?


645
00:35:39.859 --> 00:35:42.863
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
I don't know, we'll see.


646
00:35:45.765 --> 00:35:47.767
Maybe we'll watch
a different movie.


647
00:35:48.468 --> 00:35:49.870
- Sure. Okay.
- <i>Oui.</i>


648
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:52.240
Let's do that. Yeah. Okay.

649
00:35:52.939 --> 00:35:54.407
Oh.

650
00:35:54.442 --> 00:35:58.212
If it's French, I warn you,
I've probably already seen it.


651
00:35:58.245 --> 00:35:59.247
It is French.

652
00:36:02.982 --> 00:36:05.452
Oh.

653
00:36:08.388 --> 00:36:09.890
Uh...

654
00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:11.558
You travel with your own porn?

655
00:36:13.593 --> 00:36:15.896
Yes, and, uh, toothpaste.

656
00:36:18.598 --> 00:36:19.866
It's good, huh?

657
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:27.508
- I think I'm gonna go to bed.
- Why?


658
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.410
Why? You don't like this movie?

659
00:36:29.442 --> 00:36:31.412
No. I just, uh...

660
00:36:31.444 --> 00:36:33.381
I don't think that would
happen in a courthouse.


661
00:36:37.883 --> 00:36:39.919
That was a fun night, huh?

662
00:36:39.953 --> 00:36:42.288
Gosh, I thought
that was such a great idea


663
00:36:42.321 --> 00:36:45.858
about involving Stephane
in the parade.


664
00:36:45.892 --> 00:36:47.962
Mmm-hmm.

665
00:36:53.834 --> 00:36:55.368
- Glenn.
- Yeah.


666
00:36:56.502 --> 00:36:57.504
- Glenn?
- Yeah.


667
00:36:58.272 --> 00:36:59.907
Kev's idea,

668
00:36:59.939 --> 00:37:02.442
"Hobart welcomes the world."
It's not bad, huh?


669
00:37:02.475 --> 00:37:04.244
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

670
00:37:05.345 --> 00:37:06.413
- Glenn...
- Yeah.


671
00:37:06.446 --> 00:37:07.982
It'll cost, though.

672
00:37:08.015 --> 00:37:11.317
You know, we might need some
more money from the community.


673
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.921
I'm not... I don't know how
to ask people right now.


674
00:37:13.953 --> 00:37:17.258
I just think the times are...
What? What?


675
00:37:17.991 --> 00:37:20.294
- Is there moisturizer on my lips?
- No. No.


676
00:37:20.326 --> 00:37:24.464
Your eyes look...
Really pretty right now.


677
00:37:24.497 --> 00:37:27.234
Oh. That's nice.

678
00:37:27.767 --> 00:37:28.935
No, no. Keep them on.

679
00:37:28.968 --> 00:37:30.970
That's it. Oh, even prettier.

680
00:37:31.004 --> 00:37:33.874
Thanks. Anyway...

681
00:37:33.906 --> 00:37:36.977
Long Tractor really is one of
the very few thriving bits.


682
00:37:37.009 --> 00:37:38.645
Yeah! Oh...

683
00:37:43.015 --> 00:37:44.451
Sorry about my...

684
00:37:47.721 --> 00:37:49.623
- Jeez, Glenn! Gosh!
- Sheila, come on.


685
00:37:49.656 --> 00:37:52.058
- No, Glenn.
- It's game 7.


686
00:37:52.091 --> 00:37:54.494
It's... Sheila!

687
00:37:58.799 --> 00:38:00.367
Hey, how's it going?

688
00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:02.035
Fuck off.

689
00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:09.410
Tim Long!

690
00:38:09.442 --> 00:38:10.511
Tim!

691
00:38:10.544 --> 00:38:11.645
Tim Long.

692
00:38:11.678 --> 00:38:14.949
Tim. Tim. Tim.

693
00:38:21.087 --> 00:38:23.290
Your friend
seems to be catching on.


694
00:38:24.024 --> 00:38:25.526
He's not my friend.

695
00:38:25.558 --> 00:38:27.727
He's more of a cruel joke
I played on myself.


696
00:38:27.761 --> 00:38:29.697
Well, he's no Dale Hawerchuk.

697
00:38:29.729 --> 00:38:30.630
Sure.

698
00:38:30.665 --> 00:38:31.940
That's my brother's
favorite hockey player.


699
00:38:31.964 --> 00:38:33.733
Not mine, though.

700
00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:35.368
Okay. You got it.

701
00:38:35.401 --> 00:38:37.070
If you asked me
my favorite hockey player,


702
00:38:37.104 --> 00:38:39.573
I definitely wouldn't say
Dale Hawerchuk.


703
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:45.645
So, who's your favorite
hockey player, Brenda?


704
00:38:45.678 --> 00:38:47.680
Oh...

705
00:38:47.714 --> 00:38:49.583
I guess I don't really have one.

706
00:38:54.754 --> 00:38:56.490
This rink is cold.

707
00:38:59.158 --> 00:39:02.528
- I'm sorry I make you fall.
- I'm so sorry.


708
00:39:02.562 --> 00:39:05.065
<i>It felt like I was
the only person in Hobart</i>


709
00:39:05.098 --> 00:39:07.634
<i>who hadn't fallen in love
with Stephane.</i>


710
00:39:07.667 --> 00:39:08.701
It's <i>pamplemousse.</i>

711
00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:11.404
It's a fun word to say.

712
00:39:11.437 --> 00:39:12.740
<i>Made every female swoon.</i>

713
00:39:14.174 --> 00:39:16.076
<i>He inspired a freaking parade.</i>

714
00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:18.412
Aw...

715
00:39:18.444 --> 00:39:20.580
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.


716
00:39:20.613 --> 00:39:23.616
I'm not wearing this. Uh-uh.

717
00:39:23.649 --> 00:39:26.753
<i>And he was the star of the
best team Hobart had seen in years.</i>


718
00:39:26.787 --> 00:39:29.957
<i>With a real shot at beating
our arch rival, Wingham.</i>


719
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.491
No showboating.

720
00:39:35.162 --> 00:39:38.932
Ooh la la,
Stephane! Ooh la la, Stephane!


721
00:39:38.964 --> 00:39:41.035
Hobart Squirrels are number one!

722
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:46.673
Get him the
ball and watch him go!


723
00:39:48.107 --> 00:39:49.910
Seven, huh? I love Hobart.

724
00:39:49.942 --> 00:39:53.446
<i>But one thing Stephane couldn't
do was save my dad's failing business.</i>


725
00:39:53.479 --> 00:39:56.149
Sales are down this month.
We got to work on our technique.


726
00:39:56.183 --> 00:39:58.986
All right, Todd, let's try one out.
You be the customer.


727
00:40:00.453 --> 00:40:04.991
Hello, sir,
I'm interested in the 1160...


728
00:40:05.024 --> 00:40:09.028
Combine, but I'm not yet ready
to pull the trigger.


729
00:40:09.062 --> 00:40:13.066
Mmm-hmm. Okay, Geoff, you see how
he uses his hands when he's talking?


730
00:40:13.098 --> 00:40:15.001
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No. No.


731
00:40:15.035 --> 00:40:15.970
It's not wrong or right.

732
00:40:16.002 --> 00:40:19.172
It is just, uh,
a trait for me to mirror,


733
00:40:19.205 --> 00:40:21.808
when we're talking.
That way you'll trust me.


734
00:40:21.841 --> 00:40:23.977
And we'll establish rapport.

735
00:40:24.009 --> 00:40:26.613
Oh, here comes Ivan.

736
00:40:26.645 --> 00:40:29.615
Good news is he bringing today?
Jesus, fuck.


737
00:40:29.649 --> 00:40:31.752
Watch and learn, boys.
Watch and learn.


738
00:40:32.919 --> 00:40:33.953
Ivan.

739
00:40:33.986 --> 00:40:35.555
What can I do you for?

740
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:38.525
Need to bring it back, Glenn.
Things are really bad.


741
00:40:38.558 --> 00:40:39.927
Uh-huh.

742
00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:43.663
Okay. I hear you.
I hear you, buddy.


743
00:40:43.696 --> 00:40:46.066
I think if you take a look at
our re-financing plans,


744
00:40:46.098 --> 00:40:50.703
you really don't want to make the
decision until such time as, uh...


745
00:41:00.113 --> 00:41:01.549
I'll start the paperwork.

746
00:41:02.781 --> 00:41:04.750
How's the wife?

747
00:41:04.783 --> 00:41:07.720
Not good, Glenn. Not good.

748
00:41:07.754 --> 00:41:10.524
Excellent. <i>Excellente.</i>

749
00:41:10.557 --> 00:41:12.058
That was amazing, Tim Long.

750
00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:17.964
You took that acetic acid. You sized it
up and then titrated the shit out of it.


751
00:41:17.997 --> 00:41:19.566
Uh, Tim. Tim, Tim.

752
00:41:21.868 --> 00:41:24.705
Drive us to Mary's house, huh?
She wants to make out.


753
00:41:25.939 --> 00:41:27.841
Uh, no can do. Sorry.

754
00:41:29.743 --> 00:41:32.513
Uh, because I promised
I'd give Brenda a ride home.


755
00:41:33.812 --> 00:41:35.015
I live right next to Brenda.

756
00:41:35.047 --> 00:41:37.817
Amazing. We all go together.

757
00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.653
- <i>Formidable.</i> Let's go.
<i>- Formidable.</i>


758
00:41:42.888 --> 00:41:44.124
Come on.

759
00:41:47.294 --> 00:41:48.828
It's getting pretty snowy.

760
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.832
It's just flurries.

761
00:41:52.866 --> 00:41:54.902
<i>♪ Flurries...</i>

762
00:41:54.935 --> 00:41:56.871
<i>♪ You got me in a hurry</i>

763
00:41:57.837 --> 00:42:01.208
<i>♪ Just to shovel my driveway</i>

764
00:42:02.174 --> 00:42:05.546
<i>♪ Squalls, I like you
best of all ♪</i>


765
00:42:05.578 --> 00:42:07.180
Hey, do you mind if we're quiet?

766
00:42:07.212 --> 00:42:08.615
I'm an anxious driver.

767
00:42:08.647 --> 00:42:10.584
You got it.

768
00:42:12.886 --> 00:42:15.689
Tim, pull over, eh?

769
00:42:15.721 --> 00:42:18.191
Uh, no. No, it's fine.
We keep going.


770
00:42:20.794 --> 00:42:21.795
Jesus Christ!

771
00:42:26.765 --> 00:42:30.069
Tim, she likes you, huh.
Make with her.


772
00:42:30.102 --> 00:42:31.203
Uh...

773
00:42:31.236 --> 00:42:33.606
Did you learn to whisper
in a helicopter?


774
00:42:38.345 --> 00:42:40.314
Uh...

775
00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:42.615
- Do you want to...
- Yes.


776
00:42:43.183 --> 00:42:45.219
Uh, play a word game?

777
00:42:46.919 --> 00:42:48.321
Um...

778
00:42:48.354 --> 00:42:53.726
I'll say the name of a place and then
you can say another name of a place


779
00:42:53.759 --> 00:42:56.662
that begins with the last
letter of the place I said.


780
00:42:57.696 --> 00:43:00.700
- I'll start with Canada.
- Okay.


781
00:43:00.734 --> 00:43:04.337
Arkansas. Guys, do you
want to play? We're on "S."


782
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.238
Sault Ste. Marie.

783
00:43:06.272 --> 00:43:08.075
That's a great one.

784
00:43:08.107 --> 00:43:10.142
My cousin plays junior
hockey there.


785
00:43:10.176 --> 00:43:11.878
They must be good.

786
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.279
They're amazing.

787
00:43:17.149 --> 00:43:21.787
- Tim, just do it. The time is now.
- No.


788
00:43:22.622 --> 00:43:25.292
- The time is now!
- Okay.


789
00:43:25.325 --> 00:43:26.926
I'll tell you what?
I'll just get out.


790
00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:29.997
No.

791
00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:44.345
Ah... Ah... Oh...

792
00:44:01.294 --> 00:44:03.297
Oh, it's snowing, it seems, huh?

793
00:44:05.865 --> 00:44:07.334
That was crazy, Tim Long.

794
00:44:09.035 --> 00:44:10.638
What letter are we on?

795
00:44:12.772 --> 00:44:14.274
<i>After that, it became clear</i>

796
00:44:14.307 --> 00:44:16.810
<i>the person I had hoped
would be my salvation,</i>


797
00:44:16.843 --> 00:44:23.015
<i>my brother-in-arms,</i> mon camarade,
<i>made me feel lonelier than ever.</i>


798
00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:27.354
<i>So, while Stephane cut a swath
through Hobart's female population,</i>


799
00:44:27.386 --> 00:44:29.855
<i>I had never felt
like more of an outsider.</i>


800
00:44:30.823 --> 00:44:33.059
<i>Hobart's very own</i> I'etranger.

801
00:44:43.203 --> 00:44:45.272
Hey, Stephane.

802
00:44:47.874 --> 00:44:48.908
Glenn.

803
00:44:50.509 --> 00:44:52.812
You must tell Sheila
your troubles, huh?


804
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.382
What troubles?

805
00:45:00.053 --> 00:45:01.689
Oh, God. You're right.

806
00:45:02.388 --> 00:45:04.091
I just don't want to worry her.

807
00:45:04.124 --> 00:45:06.493
You worry her now.
Remember, Glenn,


808
00:45:06.526 --> 00:45:11.999
honest, lead to close.
And close, lead to sexy.


809
00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:15.836
You're a wise man, Stephane.

810
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:19.106
Hash browns?

811
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:23.977
Not so wise for Tim, I think.

812
00:45:25.044 --> 00:45:27.314
- He hate me.
- No, no, no.


813
00:45:27.346 --> 00:45:29.982
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

814
00:45:31.551 --> 00:45:32.753
Maybe.

815
00:45:33.653 --> 00:45:35.063
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm pretty sure he does.


816
00:45:35.087 --> 00:45:40.426
The thing about Tim is, and I say
this both as a father and a salesman.


817
00:45:40.459 --> 00:45:44.030
You can't coax him to do things.
He's got to be forced.


818
00:45:45.098 --> 00:45:46.866
You got to drag him to yes.

819
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.369
You'll thank me later.

820
00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:54.940
Tim. Tim.

821
00:45:54.973 --> 00:45:58.377
- Wake up. We must go. <i>Allez.</i>
- What? What?


822
00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.413
Where are the keys to the car?

823
00:46:03.482 --> 00:46:05.785
Stephane, what's going on?

824
00:46:05.819 --> 00:46:07.121
Did you get in trouble?

825
00:46:07.154 --> 00:46:10.422
Did you get a girl pregnant?
Did you get a bunch of girls pregnant?


826
00:46:10.455 --> 00:46:11.825
Do you have AIDS?

827
00:46:11.857 --> 00:46:13.469
Oh, I saw... Are you driving
with your knees?


828
00:46:13.493 --> 00:46:15.195
Tim, chill out.

829
00:46:15.227 --> 00:46:17.930
- "Chill out."
- You have to trust me, Tim.


830
00:46:17.964 --> 00:46:20.133
What? How the hell
did you get your license?


831
00:46:20.165 --> 00:46:22.568
- I don't have license.
- You don't have a license?


832
00:46:22.602 --> 00:46:24.805
I'm not stupid.
That's why we take the back roads.


833
00:46:24.837 --> 00:46:26.305
Okay, stop the car right now.

834
00:46:26.339 --> 00:46:28.350
Pull over, and you have to tell
me where we are going.


835
00:46:28.374 --> 00:46:31.143
Okay, okay,
we are going to McDonalds.


836
00:46:31.176 --> 00:46:34.113
- To McDonalds?
- Why? I know you love McDonalds.


837
00:46:34.147 --> 00:46:36.149
And it's only three hours away.
I look at the map.


838
00:46:36.182 --> 00:46:38.151
- Stop the car.
- Burgers for breakfast, Tim.


839
00:46:38.183 --> 00:46:40.823
- It is like dream come true for you.
- I don't care, stop the car.


840
00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.166
Okay, so that's not my fault.

841
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.803
You said stop, so I
stopped, so we stop.


842
00:46:58.337 --> 00:46:59.439
Oh, my... Get out.

843
00:46:59.471 --> 00:47:00.973
- What?
- Get out. Get out of the car.


844
00:47:01.006 --> 00:47:02.975
- Why?
- Because I'm driving us home.


845
00:47:03.008 --> 00:47:03.876
Okay, fine.

846
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.145
Don't yell at me, huh.

847
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.249
Whoa, whoa.

848
00:47:13.285 --> 00:47:14.453
Shit.

849
00:47:14.486 --> 00:47:17.590
Tim, I feel like I have done
things to make you not like me.


850
00:47:17.624 --> 00:47:18.959
Oh, what do you think?

851
00:47:20.292 --> 00:47:23.162
If you tell me the things,
I will not do them again.


852
00:47:23.196 --> 00:47:26.132
Okay, you know, why don't we
start with the drinking,


853
00:47:26.165 --> 00:47:28.335
the smoking,
the sex in the backseat,


854
00:47:28.368 --> 00:47:31.104
the porn and all that constant...

855
00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:37.477
What was that?

856
00:47:37.509 --> 00:47:39.046
I think you hit something.

857
00:47:41.214 --> 00:47:44.951
- Shit, shit, shit.
- Oh...


858
00:47:44.984 --> 00:47:46.653
- Oh, my God.
- I think you kill him.


859
00:47:46.685 --> 00:47:48.254
- Her.
- It's a girl?


860
00:47:48.287 --> 00:47:49.455
Yeah, it's a cow.

861
00:47:49.488 --> 00:47:50.890
Of course it's a girl.

862
00:47:51.223 --> 00:47:51.892
Oh.

863
00:47:51.924 --> 00:47:54.493
You're angry, aren't you, huh?

864
00:47:54.526 --> 00:47:56.362
- Did not like to kill the cow?
- No.


865
00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:58.430
I... I don't enjoy killing cows.

866
00:47:58.464 --> 00:48:00.400
But you, uh, eat McDonalds.

867
00:48:01.567 --> 00:48:03.303
That's not the same.

868
00:48:03.336 --> 00:48:04.679
And you wear the shoes of
leather sometimes.


869
00:48:04.703 --> 00:48:06.972
Okay, stop.
Stop. Please stop talking.


870
00:48:07.006 --> 00:48:09.276
We're in a world of shit here.

871
00:48:09.308 --> 00:48:10.310
God.

872
00:48:11.377 --> 00:48:12.645
Oh, my God.

873
00:48:12.678 --> 00:48:14.513
Oh, my God. Fuck.

874
00:48:14.546 --> 00:48:16.349
Tim, you break your mom's car.

875
00:48:17.082 --> 00:48:18.484
You know what?

876
00:48:18.517 --> 00:48:21.687
Before you came here, my life was
already a steaming pile of shit.


877
00:48:21.721 --> 00:48:25.058
But since you've been here,
you've put so much shit


878
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:26.534
on top of this shit
that was already there,


879
00:48:26.558 --> 00:48:28.662
I can't even see where
the original shit was.


880
00:48:28.694 --> 00:48:31.263
Hey, can you look at me
when I'm talking to you?


881
00:48:31.296 --> 00:48:32.932
It's my fault.

882
00:48:32.966 --> 00:48:35.134
I don't what
kind of fucking asshole


883
00:48:35.167 --> 00:48:37.002
writes to another country
to get a friend.


884
00:48:37.035 --> 00:48:39.305
- Tim, Tim.
- You've taken a dump on my soul.


885
00:48:39.339 --> 00:48:41.074
- Tim.
- What?


886
00:48:41.107 --> 00:48:42.409
I don't know what to say.

887
00:48:43.642 --> 00:48:45.311
So I will just say this.

888
00:48:46.379 --> 00:48:47.381
He is alive.

889
00:48:48.147 --> 00:48:49.149
What?

890
00:48:52.685 --> 00:48:54.688
The Jesus cow, huh?

891
00:48:54.721 --> 00:48:56.289
He rise from the dead.

892
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:57.589
She.

893
00:48:57.622 --> 00:48:59.425
She, uh...
She rise from the dead.


894
00:49:00.058 --> 00:49:01.060
<i>Oui.</i>

895
00:49:01.627 --> 00:49:02.828
Oh, my God.

896
00:49:02.861 --> 00:49:05.965
I mean, she looks okay.
We must have just stunned her.


897
00:49:05.999 --> 00:49:09.201
Just <i>fantastique,</i> huh?
Look at her go.


898
00:49:10.569 --> 00:49:13.006
You know what, Tim?

899
00:49:13.772 --> 00:49:15.341
Things, they work out.

900
00:49:17.442 --> 00:49:18.711
I've got something here.

901
00:49:19.544 --> 00:49:21.480
- Oh...
- Here we go.


902
00:49:22.749 --> 00:49:24.317
Come on, come on.

903
00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:25.552
To the Jesus cow.

904
00:49:25.584 --> 00:49:27.119
To the Jesus cow.

905
00:49:29.287 --> 00:49:31.022
Go on.

906

see the thief getting in the car.


927

So, Tim, you know, Tim,
he run out and he says, "Stop, <i>arret.</i>"

Tim said that?

He's a hero, Glenn.

934
00:51:12.491 --> 00:51:13.560

00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:39.718
<i>Bande a part. 
A bout de souffle.</i>

943
00:51:39.752 --> 00:51:41.455
Unless you've already seen them.

944
00:51:42.721 --> 00:51:44.723
The French new wave.

945
00:51:44.756 --> 00:51:46.492
Talk about pretentious.

946
00:51:46.825 --> 00:51:47.860
Who said that?

947
00:51:47.893 --> 00:51:49.895
Well, I think it was Brenda.

948
00:51:49.928 --> 00:51:52.365
- Oh, that Brenda.
- Okay, listen.


949
00:51:52.397 --> 00:51:54.867
<i>Le cercle rouge</i> is
so not pretentious.


950
00:51:54.901 --> 00:51:58.171
I'm gonna lend it you
and you're gonna watch it.


951
00:51:58.203 --> 00:52:00.205
Okay, sir Tim Long.

952
00:52:00.238 --> 00:52:02.574
<i>I was beginning to feel
something bizarre</i>


953
00:52:02.607 --> 00:52:04.310
<i>and completely alien to me.</i>

954
00:52:04.676 --> 00:52:05.711
<i>Happiness.</i>

955
00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:08.214
Tim, he is so clever, huh.

956
00:52:08.247 --> 00:52:10.350
He knows everything
about the music.


957
00:52:10.383 --> 00:52:11.384
And books.

958
00:52:12.218 --> 00:52:12.886
Yeah?

959
00:52:12.919 --> 00:52:13.720
I do.

960
00:52:13.752 --> 00:52:15.787
Sometimes
I'll be reading a book,


961
00:52:15.821 --> 00:52:17.357
laying back, reading a book,

962
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:19.491
and then
I'll just be rocking out.


963
00:52:19.524 --> 00:52:21.593
I would be reading, rocking,

964
00:52:21.627 --> 00:52:23.363
I'll be rocking and reading.

965
00:52:23.395 --> 00:52:26.832
Reading about rocking, back and forth.

966
00:52:26.866 --> 00:52:27.901
I dig it. Yeah, yeah.

967
00:52:27.933 --> 00:52:29.334
He kill me, Tim.

968
00:52:29.368 --> 00:52:31.604
Tim, he kill me,
he kill everyone here.


969
00:52:31.636 --> 00:52:32.805
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.


970
00:52:32.837 --> 00:52:36.276
I'm like the Upper Canada
Rebellion of 1838.


971
00:52:38.743 --> 00:52:41.747
Oh, 'cause that killed
several people.


972
00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:44.351
Lots, yeah,
killed lots of people.


973
00:52:45.651 --> 00:52:47.254
Hanged. They were all hanged.

974
00:52:48.955 --> 00:52:50.223
That's funny.

975
00:52:50.256 --> 00:52:51.790
Very funny.

976
00:52:51.823 --> 00:52:52.858
Glenn!

977
00:52:52.892 --> 00:52:54.694
Glenn, she's back!

978
00:52:56.928 --> 00:52:59.566
<i>♪ I just say the word ♪</i>

979
00:52:59.598 --> 00:53:00.600
She came back.

980
00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:05.538
<i>Hello, I am Stephane Belmadi.</i>

981

<i>I, uh... I love to fuck the

982
00:53:09.274 --> 00:53:10.910
<i>I like to fuck the mail box,</i>

983
00:53:10.942 --> 00:53:11.977
<i>the toaster.</i>

<i>I love the cigarette.</i>

985
00:53:12.979 --> 00:53:14.747
<i>I don't do any of that.</i>

986
00:53:14.779 --> 00:53:16.216
I would not fuck a toaster.

987
00:53:16.249 --> 00:53:17.350
I think you would.

988
00:53:17.383 --> 00:53:19.419
Stop, stop. Get out of here.

989
00:53:19.451 --> 00:53:20.285
My turn.

990
00:53:20.319 --> 00:53:21.587
<i>This is what Tim says.</i>

991
00:53:22.455 --> 00:53:23.690

<i>Howdy, I'm Tim.</i>

993
00:53:26.625 --> 00:53:29.229
- I like to fuck the book...
- No, no, no...


994
00:53:29.261 --> 00:53:30.830
- No, no, no, no.
- Fuck the book...


995
00:53:30.863 --> 00:53:32.765
That's a library copy.

996
00:53:32.797 --> 00:53:34.667
And I don't fuck Camus, so...

997
00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:36.301
But seriously, Tim.

998
00:53:36.334 --> 00:53:39.538
Why? Why?
Why, you not like the girl, huh?


999
00:53:40.538 --> 00:53:41.540
What?

1000
00:53:41.874 --> 00:53:43.843
I love the girl.

1001
00:53:43.875 --> 00:53:45.678
You know how much
I love the girl.


1002
00:53:47.379 --> 00:53:50.616
No, I do like the girl, a lot.
I just don't...


1003
00:53:50.649 --> 00:53:52.918
I... I think I just prefer
not to talk to them


1004
00:53:52.951 --> 00:53:53.986
or... Or bother them

1005
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.755
or touch... Or touch them.

1006
00:53:58.057 --> 00:53:59.292
Are you gay, huh?

1007
00:53:59.325 --> 00:54:00.593
- You like the boy?
- Mmm-mmm.


1008
00:54:00.625 --> 00:54:02.536
- No, it's okay, you like the boys.
- No, no, no.


1009
00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.497
No, I like girls a lot.
I just, um...


1010
00:54:05.531 --> 00:54:07.866
I just don't see
why they would like me.


1011
00:54:07.899 --> 00:54:08.901
What? Why?

1012
00:54:08.933 --> 00:54:11.537
You've good face, very clean.

1013
00:54:11.904 --> 00:54:13.006
You, uh,

1014
00:54:13.038 --> 00:54:14.807
- have a nice penis, huh?
- Mmm.


1015
00:54:14.839 --> 00:54:16.709
I see it in the bathroom, Tim.

1016
00:54:16.975 --> 00:54:18.678
Huh? Wow.

1017
00:54:18.944 --> 00:54:20.513
Thank you?

1018
00:54:20.546 --> 00:54:22.448
This Brenda...

1019
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.884
- She like you, I think.
- Oh, you know, I think...


1020
00:54:25.917 --> 00:54:29.388
I mean, I like her, too.
She's really pretty and...


1021
00:54:30.022 --> 00:54:31.357
I... I... What do I do?

1022
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:33.493
- How do I...
- Huh? You tell her. Easy.


1023
00:54:33.526 --> 00:54:35.428
What, do you want me
to go up and say,


1024
00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:38.865
"Hey, Brenda, I'm super
into you and I like your..."


1025
00:54:38.897 --> 00:54:42.301
"Your stupid songs
and your weird hair."


1026
00:54:42.334 --> 00:54:44.836
"And if you ask me
to touch your boobs,"


1027
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:46.406
"I would probably say yes."

1028
00:54:46.439 --> 00:54:48.707
"And, hey, well, see you later.
See you in history."


1029
00:54:48.741 --> 00:54:51.643
"I think we're learning
about Sir Wilfrid Laurier."


1030
00:54:51.676 --> 00:54:52.678
It's perfect.

1031
00:54:52.712 --> 00:54:54.080
You say just that.

1032
00:54:54.113 --> 00:54:57.916
And I like that little crinkle
between your eyes when you smile.


1033
00:54:57.950 --> 00:55:02.455
And I like that your skin smells
like a Crispy Crunch bar.


1034
00:55:02.488 --> 00:55:04.658
And when I see you
I just wanna...


1035
00:55:08.694 --> 00:55:10.063
What do you wanna do, Tim?

1036
00:55:11.997 --> 00:55:13.066
What, we are going?

1037
00:55:22.508 --> 00:55:23.875
Oh, fuck.

1038
00:55:23.908 --> 00:55:26.979
Uh, Tim, I hope you are okay.

1039
00:55:27.011 --> 00:55:28.914
It's important
to drink the water.


1040
00:55:30.515 --> 00:55:32.584
You drink the water,
you not get sick.


1041
00:55:44.062 --> 00:55:45.097
- Okay.
- This way.


1042
00:55:45.131 --> 00:55:46.566
- This way, this way.
- Okay.


1043
00:55:46.598 --> 00:55:47.399

Wow, okay.

00:56:29.442 --> 00:56:30.610
Fifty-four dollars.

1054
00:56:31.743 --> 00:56:35.914
Maybe I'll go to the dollar
store and buy 54 things.

1065
00:57:15.488 --> 00:57:17.557
Dude can't take a fucking joke.

1066

Let's go, White Squirrels!
Come on!


1067
00:57:30.602 --> 00:57:32.003
Let's go, White Squirrels.

1068
00:57:32.037 --> 00:57:34.140
Come on, Stephane.

1069
00:57:34.172 --> 00:57:35.741
What are you doing there?

1070
00:57:35.774 --> 00:57:36.808
Use the wing.

1071
00:57:36.841 --> 00:57:38.177
Give it to the wing.

Come on.

1073
00:57:43.515 --> 00:57:44.950
Way to go, brown clown.

1074
00:57:44.984 --> 00:57:46.653
Yeah, brown clown, way to go.

1075
00:57:47.086 --> 00:57:48.455
All right.

1076
00:57:50.122 --> 00:57:51.190
Hey.

1077
00:57:51.223 --> 00:57:52.458
Hey, that's a foul.

1078
00:57:52.491 --> 00:57:55.595
- Move it, move it.
- Watch your feet, brown clown.


1079
00:58:08.307 --> 00:58:10.709
Uh, I'm sorry,
I'm really nervous.


1080
00:58:10.743 --> 00:58:11.811
It's okay, it's okay.

1081
00:58:11.843 --> 00:58:13.989
You know what, you can do your
presentation in English.


1082
00:58:14.013 --> 00:58:15.181
The film is in French.

1083
00:58:15.214 --> 00:58:16.916
Okay. Thank you.

1084
00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:18.850
Um...

1085
00:58:20.185 --> 00:58:22.288
Now you'll immediately see
the director uses


1086
00:58:22.321 --> 00:58:25.691
costuming and lighting
to convey mood.


1087
00:58:25.723 --> 00:58:29.227
And, um, we open on a
protagonist, who's a thief.


1088
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:31.130
A con, a cheat.

1089
00:58:31.162 --> 00:58:32.264
A cock smoker.

1090
00:58:33.899 --> 00:58:34.901
And he's...

1091
00:58:36.035 --> 00:58:37.270
<i>I love the girl.</i>

1092

<i>You know how much
I love the girl.</i>


1093
00:58:40.839 --> 00:58:41.839
Oh, shit.

1094
00:58:44.776 --> 00:58:46.812
Watch your feet,
brown fucking clown.


1095
00:58:48.279 --> 00:58:50.048
Oh!

1096
00:59:05.997 --> 00:59:08.099
<i>No, I like girls a lot.
I just don't...</i>


1097
00:59:08.133 --> 00:59:09.768
"I like girls." What a freak.

1098
00:59:11.337 --> 00:59:13.573
Tim wants to get on
Brenda Crowfoot!


1099
00:59:14.205 --> 00:59:15.274
Loser.

1100
00:59:15.307 --> 00:59:17.042
<i>I think that I would
probably say yes.</i>


1101
00:59:17.942 --> 00:59:18.944
Stop it.

1102
00:59:26.084 --> 00:59:27.819
This is the greatest thing ever.

1103
00:59:31.357 --> 00:59:33.159
Come on. Come on.

1104
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.162
Damn it!

1105
00:59:40.098 --> 00:59:43.001
Well, son, I'm not one
to point fingers,


1106
00:59:43.035 --> 00:59:44.971
never have been, not my nature.

1107
00:59:45.904 --> 00:59:49.576
But, uh, you just fucked
the entire town.


1108
00:59:50.241 --> 00:59:51.142
It's not my fault.

1109
00:59:51.176 --> 00:59:53.078
Not your fault?
Well, whose fault is it?


1110
00:59:53.111 --> 00:59:55.714
Uh, Colonel Gadhafi, hmm?

1111
00:59:56.348 --> 00:59:58.116
You're a disgrace, son.

1112
00:59:58.149 --> 00:59:59.684
You're disgrace
to the White Squirrel.


1113
00:59:59.718 --> 01:00:02.055
There, I said it!
Okay? I said it.


1114
01:00:02.921 --> 01:00:04.089
Fuck you

1115
01:00:04.857 --> 01:00:06.025
and fuck your White Squirrel.

1116
01:00:06.991 --> 01:00:09.127
And fuck this
piece of shit town!


1117
01:00:12.897 --> 01:00:15.800
- Shame on you!
- I'll be okay. Huh?


1118
01:00:15.834 --> 01:00:16.836
Enough!

1119
01:00:16.868 --> 01:00:18.236
Me? You saw what he did. This...

1120
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:20.172
It's not how we do things
in Hobart.


1121
01:00:20.205 --> 01:00:22.308
Oh, yeah. No.
We just victimize teenage boys


1122
01:00:22.341 --> 01:00:25.411
because we're scared and jealous
that they're not like us.


1123
01:00:25.444 --> 01:00:26.812
Sure.

1124
01:00:26.846 --> 01:00:30.716
You know what? I don't think I can
be with a man that I don't respect.


1125
01:00:30.749 --> 01:00:32.218
We need to take a break.

1126
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.287
I'll pick up my stuff
on the weekend.


1127
01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:44.297
What? Hmm?

1128
01:00:45.296 --> 01:00:46.298
Nothing.

1129
01:00:47.433 --> 01:00:48.968
You wanna give me 20?

1130
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.069
- No.
- Twenty laps?


1131
01:00:50.102 --> 01:00:51.337
High stepping. Let's go.

1132
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:54.339
- High stepping. Let's go!
- I'm sorry. Ow!


1133
01:00:54.372 --> 01:00:56.008
Come on, let's go.

1134
01:00:59.044 --> 01:01:01.747
I guess you got to finally
see the real Hobart.


1135
01:01:01.779 --> 01:01:02.948
I do not believe this.

1136
01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.750
They say Canada is just
the ugly friend of the USA.


1137
01:01:05.783 --> 01:01:07.452
But I loved this ugly friend.

1138
01:01:07.486 --> 01:01:08.788
Yeah, I know.

1139
01:01:09.787 --> 01:01:11.790
They can only fool you
for so long.


1140
01:01:11.823 --> 01:01:12.858
Yeah, I don't understand.

1141
01:01:12.892 --> 01:01:15.428
Hey, Brenda, you're gonna go
make out with Tim Long?


1142
01:01:15.461 --> 01:01:16.294
What?

1143
01:01:16.328 --> 01:01:19.765
No. I have Cape Breton
step dancing.


1144
01:01:19.797 --> 01:01:21.167
I'm nice to them. I say nice...

1145
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.169
Hey, Brenda, Tim Long
is waiting for you.


1146
01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:26.171
- He's just dying to see you.
- And your boobs.


1147
01:01:26.205 --> 01:01:28.074
Like I said, I have
Cape Breton step dance


1148
01:01:28.107 --> 01:01:29.409
on a Wednesday, so...

1149
01:01:31.176 --> 01:01:33.712
Why is everyone asking me
about Tim Long?


1150
01:01:33.745 --> 01:01:36.014
You total dick!

1151
01:01:36.047 --> 01:01:38.250
- Tim.
- Was that supposed to be funny?


1152
01:01:38.283 --> 01:01:40.786
You swapped that stupid video
we made for <i>Le Cercle Rouge.</i>


1153
01:01:40.819 --> 01:01:42.321
- That was my presentation!
- No.


1154
01:01:42.354 --> 01:01:45.057
No, you told me that you wanted
to show the movie to Brenda.


1155
01:01:45.089 --> 01:01:46.191
- What?
- Come on, Long.


1156
01:01:46.225 --> 01:01:47.301
She's right there, hump it out.

1157
01:01:47.325 --> 01:01:50.729
No, I sw... I switched
the movie to push you, huh,


1158
01:01:50.763 --> 01:01:53.399
because I want Brenda to see
how much you like her.


1159
01:01:53.432 --> 01:01:54.966
Okay, what movie?

1160
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.204
Stephane swapped <i>Le Cercle Rouge</i>
for this stupid video we took,


1161
01:01:58.236 --> 01:02:00.472
and the whole class saw me say
how much I like your hair


1162
01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:02.975
and your stupid songs and
how much I want to kiss you.


1163
01:02:03.008 --> 01:02:04.243
You did?

1164
01:02:05.477 --> 01:02:07.113
Tim, I was trying to be
a good friend.


1165
01:02:07.145 --> 01:02:08.413
You humiliated me.

1166
01:02:08.446 --> 01:02:11.249
You made me look like
an idiot. You ruined my life.


1167
01:02:11.283 --> 01:02:12.284
You're no friend of mine.

1168
01:02:12.317 --> 01:02:15.086
No, of course,
because you have no friends,


1169
01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.788
not me, not anyone.

1170
01:02:16.821 --> 01:02:18.923
You know, what they're
saying about you is true.


1171
01:02:18.957 --> 01:02:20.326
You're a no-friend loser.

1172
01:02:20.359 --> 01:02:23.962
You're a self-centered,
narcissistic, sex crazed,


1173
01:02:23.995 --> 01:02:25.105
- thoroughly absurd...
- What?


1174
01:02:25.129 --> 01:02:26.999
Okay, so you like my hair?

1175
01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:28.800
No, I don't like your hair.

1176
01:02:28.834 --> 01:02:30.236
I... I... I was drunk.

1177
01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:32.404
And he made me say things
I don't mean to say.


1178
01:02:32.437 --> 01:02:35.406
I don't like your hair
or your stupid songs or you!


1179
01:02:35.439 --> 01:02:36.742
I don't like you!

1180
01:02:42.314 --> 01:02:43.316
Brenda.

1181
01:02:44.015 --> 01:02:45.283
Shit.

1182
01:02:45.317 --> 01:02:48.387
You know, I wish
I not choose you,


1183
01:02:48.419 --> 01:02:50.255
huh, or this bucket
of shit place.


1184
01:02:50.288 --> 01:02:52.424
Yeah, well, I wish that, too.

1185
01:02:52.457 --> 01:02:55.862
<i>Va te faire foutre!</i>

1186
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.910
Please, somebody!

1187
01:03:10.942 --> 01:03:13.111
Mom! Mom!

1188
01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:18.350
Where are the Doritos?
And where's Mom?


1189
01:03:23.855 --> 01:03:27.026
"Dearest Tim, I've decided to
move out of the house for a..."


1190
01:03:27.058 --> 01:03:28.393
- What?
- It gets worse.


1191
01:03:29.928 --> 01:03:33.132
Well, maybe not worse,
but it starts bad, stays bad.


1192
01:03:34.466 --> 01:03:37.002
<i>Your dad is a wonderful man,</i>

1193
01:03:37.035 --> 01:03:39.337
<i>but it's been clear
for some time</i>


1194
01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:42.841
<i>that my life is missing
a certain</i> je ne sais quoi.


1195
01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.877
<i>"Je ne sais quoi"?</i>

1196
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:46.011
Yeah, <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

1197
01:03:46.044 --> 01:03:47.547
God, fucking Stephane.

1198
01:03:49.448 --> 01:03:50.449
Language.

1199
01:03:53.051 --> 01:03:56.455
<i>I... I couldn't believe I'd
invited this chaos into my life.</i>


1200
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.129
You can come stay with us
for as long as you need.


1201
01:04:05.162 --> 01:04:07.232
Thank you.

1202
01:04:07.265 --> 01:04:09.200
<i>It wasn't just me
shunning Stephane.</i>


1203
01:04:09.234 --> 01:04:12.203
<i>The school had turned
on him, too.</i>


1204
01:04:12.236 --> 01:04:16.207
<i>He'd lost us a soccer match and
called our town a piece of shit.</i>


1205
01:04:16.241 --> 01:04:17.609
<i>Which it might have been,</i>

1206
01:04:17.642 --> 01:04:19.386
<i>but they didn't like hearing
it from someone like him.</i>


1207
01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:23.615
<i>If they were looking for a reason
to turn on a stranger in their town,</i>


1208
01:04:24.283 --> 01:04:25.484
<i>they'd found one.</i>

1209
01:04:44.268 --> 01:04:45.471
Looks good.

1210
01:04:45.504 --> 01:04:46.873
Ah...

1211
01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:51.009
- Hi.
- How are you?


1212
01:04:51.042 --> 01:04:52.377
Yeah, I'm good.

1213
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:54.412
Sit down, let's chat.

1214
01:04:55.046 --> 01:04:57.315
Uh, how's Aunt Thelma?

1215
01:04:57.348 --> 01:05:00.586
She snores. One night,
at 4:00 in the morning, she...


1216
01:05:00.618 --> 01:05:02.954
I can't believe Stephane
made you leave.


1217
01:05:02.988 --> 01:05:03.989
What?

1218
01:05:04.022 --> 01:05:04.957
I mean, you know I'm agnostic,

1219
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:07.158
but I think he might
literally be a demon.


1220
01:05:07.192 --> 01:05:10.129
Tim! Things have not been great

1221
01:05:10.162 --> 01:05:12.598
between your dad and I
for a very long time.


1222
01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:16.134
Okay? Stephane is not to
blame and neither are you.


1223
01:05:16.167 --> 01:05:17.602
Yeah. Nobody's blaming me.

1224
01:05:17.636 --> 01:05:19.438
I'm... I'm great.

1225
01:05:20.238 --> 01:05:23.008
Yeah, you're great.
You're great.


1226
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.319
- Come here.
- Who would blame me?


1227
01:05:24.343 --> 01:05:26.479
Come here.
Nobody is blaming you.


1228
01:05:27.279 --> 01:05:28.714
- Sheila?
- Mmm, just a sec.


1229
01:05:28.747 --> 01:05:29.982
Sheila?

1230
01:05:30.582 --> 01:05:31.584
Love you so much.

1231
01:05:32.683 --> 01:05:34.553
Oh. Hey.

1232
01:05:34.586 --> 01:05:35.921
Is that Kevin?

1233
01:05:35.953 --> 01:05:39.457
- Yeah, it's Kevin. Yeah, he looks pissed.
- Just 10 seconds. Please.


1234
01:05:40.192 --> 01:05:41.227
Sheila!

1235
01:05:41.259 --> 01:05:44.562
This better not be about
the fucking acorn, okay?


1236
01:05:44.596 --> 01:05:47.566
- It's not about the acorn.
- Okay.


1237
01:05:47.598 --> 01:05:50.702
You're gonna be at the parade
tomorrow, right? Okay?


1238
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:54.573
Try to remember that most
people are not really bad


1239
01:05:54.605 --> 01:05:58.142
and not really stupid, okay?

1240
01:05:58.176 --> 01:06:00.346
They're just doing the best
that they can.


1241
01:06:04.082 --> 01:06:05.551
- Yes, Kevin.
- It's about the acorn.


1242
01:06:05.584 --> 01:06:07.618
I knew it was about
the fucking acorn.


1243
01:06:07.651 --> 01:06:11.691
The town, the squirrel
and my life.


1244
01:06:17.629 --> 01:06:18.730
What...

1245
01:06:20.232 --> 01:06:22.969
<i>Putain, merde,</i> shit!

1246
01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:27.271
You know why I come here?

1247
01:06:27.305 --> 01:06:29.640
I thought it would
be different, huh.


1248
01:06:29.674 --> 01:06:31.744
Where I'm from,
the kids who look like me,


1249
01:06:31.776 --> 01:06:34.446
they only hang out with
people who look like me.


1250
01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:36.515
In Hobart,

1251
01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:39.083
it's the same,

1252
01:06:39.116 --> 01:06:41.120
maybe because Hobart is shit.

1253
01:06:41.653 --> 01:06:43.622
Huh. Canada is shit!

1254
01:06:43.654 --> 01:06:46.091
They'll always find a way
to screw you.


1255
01:06:46.124 --> 01:06:49.627
- I... I need to go clear my head.
- Here, take the truck.


1256
01:06:52.663 --> 01:06:53.765
Thank you, Crowfeet.

1257
01:07:00.272 --> 01:07:04.410
<i>The next morning, as everyone
was getting ready for the parade,</i>


1258
01:07:04.442 --> 01:07:06.645
<i>all I could think about
was where Stephane was,</i>


1259
01:07:06.678 --> 01:07:08.781
<i>and who else's life
he might be ruining.</i>


1260
01:07:15.252 --> 01:07:16.521
Whoa.

1261
01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.462
Okay, we, uh... We gotta...

1262
01:07:25.464 --> 01:07:28.167
- We gotta stay calm.
- Why?


1263
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.801
It's not fair!

1264
01:07:29.834 --> 01:07:33.638
Kev, it's gonna be okay.
Maybe we can fix it.


1265
01:07:33.671 --> 01:07:37.175
It won't be the same!
They ruined her!


1266
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:39.143
"Her"?

1267
01:07:39.176 --> 01:07:41.312
Who could do such a thing?

1268
01:07:42.446 --> 01:07:44.082
I'll give you three guesses.

1269
01:07:44.116 --> 01:07:45.150
Stephane?

1270
01:07:45.183 --> 01:07:47.186
He's not that kind of kid.

1271
01:07:47.718 --> 01:07:48.586
Mmm.

1272
01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.323
- Is he?
- Well, you tell me.


1273
01:07:51.355 --> 01:07:53.357
There's the head butt, huh?

1274
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:55.526
There's the, uh...

1275
01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.096
"Fuck
the White Squirrel," right?


1276
01:07:58.129 --> 01:08:02.300
Plus, I saw him hanging
around the town hall at 3:00 this morning.


1277
01:08:02.334 --> 01:08:03.511
So you think Stephane did this?

1278
01:08:03.535 --> 01:08:06.171
What I think is
we don't know shit, son.


1279
01:08:06.203 --> 01:08:07.538
Of course we won't know anything

1280
01:08:07.571 --> 01:08:09.540
until we get
the autopsy results back.


1281
01:08:09.573 --> 01:08:11.442
Appears to be
a single assailant.


1282
01:08:11.475 --> 01:08:13.778
Subcutaneous abrasions
along the right femur there.


1283
01:08:13.812 --> 01:08:16.314
It looks like there's some
flesh underneath the claws,


1284
01:08:16.348 --> 01:08:17.624
which means the victim
did fight back.


1285
01:08:17.648 --> 01:08:18.950
Tell me she didn't suffer.

1286
01:08:18.983 --> 01:08:22.420
Oh, Kevin,
I would love to be able to tell you that,


1287
01:08:22.453 --> 01:08:24.555
but I'm not a liar.

1288
01:08:24.589 --> 01:08:26.492
We don't know anything
about this guy.


1289
01:08:26.524 --> 01:08:28.594
I heard his old man
did some jail time.


1290
01:08:28.626 --> 01:08:30.495
Well, that's true.
It's in his file.


1291
01:08:30.528 --> 01:08:32.730
I read the file too, Gary.

1292
01:08:32.764 --> 01:08:35.567
His dad was arrested
during labor protest.


1293
01:08:35.599 --> 01:08:37.111
- He was the head of the union.
- Mmm-hmm.


1294
01:08:37.135 --> 01:08:40.372
Take this down to the lab. Have the
boys check it for blood, urine, semen.


1295
01:08:40.404 --> 01:08:42.474
- Yes, sir.
- My point exactly.


1296
01:08:42.506 --> 01:08:44.475
Troublemaker, born and bred.

1297
01:08:44.509 --> 01:08:46.745
The apple never falls
far from the tree.


1298
01:08:46.777 --> 01:08:49.814
Okay.
Maybe he came here for a fresh start.


1299
01:08:49.848 --> 01:08:52.518
Fresh start? The only thing he
got fresh with is Herb's daughter.


1300
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:54.185
Yeah... What?

1301
01:08:54.219 --> 01:08:55.554
Fresh with your daughter.

1302
01:08:57.488 --> 01:08:59.357
Did you have a hand in this?

1303
01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:00.826
What? No, no, no, no,
I haven't...


1304
01:09:00.858 --> 01:09:03.528
He's not staying...
He's staying with the Crowfoots.


1305
01:09:03.562 --> 01:09:05.564
Right. Shooting off guns.

1306
01:09:05.596 --> 01:09:07.232
He hit my car last night.

1307
01:09:07.264 --> 01:09:09.233
Maybe he was aiming
at my gas tank.


1308
01:09:09.267 --> 01:09:10.635
Ka-boom!

1309
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:12.671
Make my wife a widow.

1310
01:09:12.703 --> 01:09:14.514
All right, why don't you quit
crying into your Dinky Donuts


1311
01:09:14.538 --> 01:09:16.809
and bring him in, hmm?

1312
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:19.477
Sure thing, Gary.

1313
01:09:20.679 --> 01:09:23.448
Yeah, there is no way.
There's no freaking way.


1314
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.517
<i>I know he hated
the White Squirrel, but...</i>


1315
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:27.886
Yeah, I know, but he was
with you last night, right?


1316
01:09:27.919 --> 01:09:30.589
Sure, until he took
my brother's truck


1317
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:33.357
and drove off into
the direction of the town.


1318
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:34.559
Super furious. And then,

1319
01:09:34.593 --> 01:09:36.595
he came back
this morning looking...


1320
01:09:36.961 --> 01:09:38.163
Mega-guilty.

1321
01:09:38.830 --> 01:09:41.733
But still,
there's no freaking way.


1322
01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:43.801
Okay, look, I need you
to do something for me.


1323
01:09:43.835 --> 01:09:46.639
No, I am not doing
anything for you.


1324
01:09:47.706 --> 01:09:48.840
That tractor has sailed.

1325
01:09:48.872 --> 01:09:51.477
Okay. Would you do it
for Stephane?


1326
01:09:56.848 --> 01:09:58.550
<i>Stephane was many things...</i>

1327
01:09:58.582 --> 01:10:01.252
<i>Oversexed,
intellectually bereft,</i>


1328
01:10:01.286 --> 01:10:02.520
<i>permanently erect.</i>

1329
01:10:03.688 --> 01:10:06.592
<i>But I knew he wasn't a liar
or a criminal.</i>


1330
01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.894
<i>And I had to make the town
see that, too.</i>


1331
01:10:10.362 --> 01:10:11.596
- Hi.
- Hi.


1332
01:10:19.304 --> 01:10:20.806
Brenda.

1333
01:10:20.839 --> 01:10:23.341
That is crazy. 
That is so weird.

1334
01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:25.577
Tim Long? What are
the chances of that?


1335
01:10:25.609 --> 01:10:27.312
One in a million, maybe.

1336
01:10:27.344 --> 01:10:30.548
I don't know how he got here.
That's too weird.


1337
01:10:31.282 --> 01:10:32.151
I just can't believe it.

1338
01:10:32.184 --> 01:10:35.687
I... I never knew
this could never happen.


1339
01:10:35.719 --> 01:10:37.455
It's the weirdest thing.

1340
01:10:37.488 --> 01:10:38.924
What do you want, Tim?

1341
01:10:38.956 --> 01:10:41.693
Listen, you're in big trouble. Okay?
Because they think you did that.


1342
01:10:42.359 --> 01:10:43.594
Just like Paris.

1343
01:10:43.627 --> 01:10:45.997
Something go wrong,
blame Stephane.


1344
01:10:46.031 --> 01:10:48.700
The squirrel get broken,
you blame Stephane.


1345
01:10:48.733 --> 01:10:50.602
Money go missing,
you blame Stephane.


1346
01:10:50.635 --> 01:10:53.005
Substitute teacher
gets pregnant,


1347
01:10:53.037 --> 01:10:54.240
blame Stephane.

1348
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.242
What?

1349
01:10:57.509 --> 01:10:59.310
Fuck. Shit.

1350
01:10:59.344 --> 01:11:00.679
- Okay, come on.
- Why?


1351
01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:02.547
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1352
01:11:03.447 --> 01:11:05.316
Okay. Put these on.

1353
01:11:07.786 --> 01:11:09.788
Please, it's your turn
to trust me.


1354
01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:25.504
I can't see shit.
Which way are we going?


1355
01:11:25.536 --> 01:11:27.638
If you're gonna let
your kids come to the parade,


1356
01:11:27.671 --> 01:11:29.974
you can't let 'em play
with the beaver tails, okay?


1357
01:11:30.008 --> 01:11:31.643
They play
with their bottoms all day,


1358
01:11:31.675 --> 01:11:33.521
next thing you know,
there's baby shit in the beaver.


1359
01:11:33.545 --> 01:11:35.281
That's why you don't adopt.

1360
01:11:37.916 --> 01:11:41.720
I went to the Crowfoots',
and he was already gone.


1361
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:45.790
Damn it, Herb.
You had one job to do.


1362
01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:47.858
- I'm sorry, Gary.
- Mmm-hmm.


1363
01:11:47.892 --> 01:11:49.795
I saw their truck
on the edge of town.


1364
01:11:49.827 --> 01:11:50.995
He might be here somewhere.

1365
01:11:51.028 --> 01:11:53.764
No shit. He's probably trying
to finish what he started.


1366
01:11:53.797 --> 01:11:55.599
He only wants to ruin
our whole damn parade.


1367
01:11:55.633 --> 01:11:56.800
- He wouldn't.
- He wouldn't?


1368
01:11:56.834 --> 01:12:00.104
Oh, he hates this town,
and everything we stand for, Herb.


1369
01:12:00.138 --> 01:12:03.675
Peace, freedom,
more traditional way of life.


1370
01:12:03.707 --> 01:12:05.310
- Hi, Gary.
- Kev.


1371
01:12:05.977 --> 01:12:08.814
Now, listen, I want you to do

1372
01:12:08.846 --> 01:12:11.849
a thorough sweep of the
entire parade route, okay?


1373
01:12:11.883 --> 01:12:15.120
And you let me know when you
have eyes on that son of a bitch.


1374
01:12:15.152 --> 01:12:16.253
Yes, sir.

1375
01:12:31.603 --> 01:12:33.839
Tim! Tim! Tim!
Where are we going?


1376
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:34.807
What's the plan, Tim?

1377
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.875
People will hear the accent!

1378
01:12:36.907 --> 01:12:38.576
I don't have accent,
you have accent!


1379
01:12:38.609 --> 01:12:41.546
Hey, guys, I actually
can't see anything, so...


1380
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.814
SOS!

1381
01:12:43.848 --> 01:12:45.584
Tim, Brenda is falling.

1382
01:12:45.617 --> 01:12:46.652
Oh, fuck!

1383
01:12:46.684 --> 01:12:47.695
Let me help you up.
Give me your hand.


1384
01:12:47.719 --> 01:12:50.055
Hey, that Mexican fuck
is actually that Arab fuck!


1385
01:12:50.087 --> 01:12:52.456
No, no, no. I am a Mexican.

1386
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:53.692
Uh, <i>por favor!</i>

1387
01:12:53.724 --> 01:12:54.759
Hey, it's him!

1388
01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:55.960
That's him!

1389
01:12:55.993 --> 01:12:57.828
That's the perp!

1390
01:12:57.862 --> 01:12:59.464
Fuck.

1391
01:12:59.496 --> 01:13:01.465
Fuck! Fuck!

1392
01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:03.402
Get out of my way.
Get out of my way.


1393
01:13:03.434 --> 01:13:05.870
<i>Right then, I knew I had
to stand up for Stephane,</i>


1394
01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:08.172
<i>and make the town see
what I saw in him,</i>


1395
01:13:08.206 --> 01:13:10.075
<i>because that's what friends do
for each other.</i>


1396
01:13:10.108 --> 01:13:11.710
Stop the parade! Stop.

1397
01:13:11.742 --> 01:13:13.344
Stop the parade.

1398
01:13:13.377 --> 01:13:15.755
What are we dancing for?
I didn't know there was gonna be a dance.


1399
01:13:15.779 --> 01:13:16.814
Stop.

1400
01:13:16.848 --> 01:13:18.750
This is fun, but who is that?

1401
01:13:18.782 --> 01:13:20.026
What do you think
I'm doing? Stop.


1402
01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:22.153
I'm not dancing.
Stop the parade.


1403
01:13:22.187 --> 01:13:23.688
Stop the...

1404
01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.089
Stop the friggin' parade.

1405
01:13:25.122 --> 01:13:27.425
What are you doing, Long?

1406
01:13:27.459 --> 01:13:28.527
Hey, Gary.

1407
01:13:29.193 --> 01:13:30.828
Look what the cat dragged in.

1408
01:13:30.862 --> 01:13:32.898
No, no, no. Let him go, please.

1409
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:33.898
Let him go. Please, let him go.

1410
01:13:33.932 --> 01:13:37.169
- You're ruining my parade.
- Just hold on.


1411
01:13:37.202 --> 01:13:39.138
<i>Uh...</i>

1412
01:13:40.772 --> 01:13:41.774
<i>Okay.</i>

1413
01:13:47.478 --> 01:13:48.646
<i>Okay.</i>

1414
01:13:48.679 --> 01:13:52.750
<i>Now I know I've never been the
most popular kid in school...</i>


1415
01:13:52.783 --> 01:13:53.986
No shit!

1416
01:13:54.652 --> 01:13:55.720
<i>Okay.</i>

1417
01:13:55.752 --> 01:13:58.590
<i>Uh, and I know a lot of you
probably think I'm some...</i>


1418
01:13:58.622 --> 01:13:59.424
You're a creep!

1419
01:13:59.456 --> 01:14:00.825
- Nerd.
- That's right.


1420
01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:02.794
Go make another tape,
you pervert.


1421
01:14:02.827 --> 01:14:04.096
Go bang Brenda.

1422
01:14:04.828 --> 01:14:06.063
Everyone hates you.

1423
01:14:07.564 --> 01:14:09.099
<i>Okay.</i>

1424
01:14:09.133 --> 01:14:11.803
<i>Well, uh, I just want
to say that Stephane...</i>


1425
01:14:13.004 --> 01:14:16.541
<i>Stephane Belmade is my friend,
and he's a really great guy.</i>


1426
01:14:16.573 --> 01:14:18.042
<i>Okay, come on.</i>

1427
01:14:18.076 --> 01:14:20.746
<i>And I know he would never
do that to the squirrel.</i>


1428
01:14:21.746 --> 01:14:23.547
But how do you know, Tim?

1429
01:14:23.581 --> 01:14:24.650
Yeah!

1430
01:14:27.218 --> 01:14:29.621
<i>Because... Because I just know.</i>

1431
01:14:30.654 --> 01:14:31.723
<i>I just know.</i>

1432
01:14:37.862 --> 01:14:40.832
<i>And if you're not willing
to give a visitor to our town</i>


1433
01:14:40.865 --> 01:14:41.899
<i>the benefit of the doubt,</i>

1434
01:14:41.933 --> 01:14:44.870
<i>then I'm not sure I have
anything left to say to you.</i>


1435
01:14:44.902 --> 01:14:45.970
Okey-doke.

1436
01:14:46.004 --> 01:14:47.538
<i>Wait, no, wait.
Can you stop, please?</i>


1437
01:14:47.572 --> 01:14:50.808
<i>It's a figure of speech.
I have a little bit more to say.</i>


1438
01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:56.180
<i>Stephane Belmade has done
so much for so many of us.</i>


1439
01:14:56.848 --> 01:14:58.582
<i>Yeah.</i>

1440
01:14:58.617 --> 01:15:02.220
<i>You know, he came here and he was
ready to see the best in all of us,</i>


1441
01:15:02.252 --> 01:15:04.121
<i>but we chose to see
the worst in him</i>


1442
01:15:04.154 --> 01:15:06.925
<i>because of what,
because of the way he looks.</i>


1443
01:15:06.957 --> 01:15:08.259
<i>But, look, it's not too late.</i>

1444
01:15:08.292 --> 01:15:10.996
<i>We can launch a full-scale
investigation, we could...</i>


1445
01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:13.063
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
we know what he did.


1446
01:15:13.096 --> 01:15:14.499
- Yeah.
- Okay?


1447
01:15:14.532 --> 01:15:17.269
I saw him break into town hall
yelling, "Fuck ze White Squirrel!"


1448
01:15:17.301 --> 01:15:18.545
- <i>Okay.</i>
- "Fuck it. Fuck it hard!"


1449
01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:21.805
<i>Okay, that can't be true.
Stephane, where were you last night?</i>


1450
01:15:21.839 --> 01:15:22.974
Yeah.

1451
01:15:23.006 --> 01:15:24.542
Tell us.

1452
01:15:24.576 --> 01:15:28.078
I cannot say
where I was. <i>Desole.</i>


1453
01:15:28.112 --> 01:15:29.915
Herb, take him away.

1454
01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:30.981
- <i>Wait.</i>
- Yes, sir.


1455
01:15:31.014 --> 01:15:32.683
- <i>No, no, no.</i>
- Wait!


1456
01:15:33.684 --> 01:15:34.685
Glenn?

1457
01:15:35.152 --> 01:15:36.787
Stephane was with me.

1458
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:37.889
- Come on.
- What?


1459
01:15:37.921 --> 01:15:39.723
And thank
friggin' Christ he was.


1460
01:15:39.756 --> 01:15:41.992
Where to begin? Uh...

1461
01:15:42.026 --> 01:15:43.560
Seven years ago,

1462
01:15:43.594 --> 01:15:47.765
the Canadian government made a series
of disastrous economic decisions...


1463
01:15:47.799 --> 01:15:48.834
<i>Dad!</i>

1464
01:15:48.867 --> 01:15:51.603
<i>Maybe... Maybe start
nearer the end.</i>


1465
01:15:51.635 --> 01:15:54.738
Smart boy. I just wanted
to give them a bit of context,


1466
01:15:54.772 --> 01:15:57.175
put a backstory there, but,
uh...


1467
01:15:57.207 --> 01:15:59.777
<i>Hello? Um...</i>

1468
01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:01.278
<i>Like a lot of youse,</i>

1469
01:16:01.312 --> 01:16:04.049
<i>I've got a business
that's going under.</i>


1470
01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:07.618
<i>Last night, I was desperate,
on the verge of losing everything.</i>


1471
01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:11.223
Hey!

1472
01:16:13.124 --> 01:16:15.126
Glenn, what are you doing, huh?

1473
01:16:15.158 --> 01:16:17.194
<i>Stephane threw me in a chair,</i>

1474
01:16:17.228 --> 01:16:20.866
<i>made me some coffee and
talked some sense into me.</i>


1475
01:16:24.434 --> 01:16:28.772
<i>"Glenn,
you get caught, you go to jail!"</i>


1476
01:16:28.805 --> 01:16:33.243
<i>"You cannot do that to Tim and to Sheila.
They love you so much."</i>


1477
01:16:33.277 --> 01:16:36.147
<i>Uh, I can't really
do the accent that good.</i>


1478
01:16:36.179 --> 01:16:39.084
<i>Anyways, he sat with me
all night.</i>


1479
01:16:39.117 --> 01:16:43.154
<i>He didn't leave my side, did you,
my little French buddy?</i>


1480
01:16:43.187 --> 01:16:45.223
Mr. Long's telling the truth!

1481
01:16:45.255 --> 01:16:47.124
There's a bonfire in there!

1482
01:16:47.157 --> 01:16:48.392
Hold on a moment.

1483
01:16:48.425 --> 01:16:50.361
You couldn't have seen Stephane.

1484
01:16:50.394 --> 01:16:54.131
So, where did you spend
last night, Gary?


1485
01:16:54.365 --> 01:16:55.233
Me?

1486
01:16:55.265 --> 01:16:56.602
Fuck.

1487
01:16:57.702 --> 01:16:58.870
Uh...

1488
01:16:58.902 --> 01:16:59.970
I was with Diane.

1489
01:17:00.004 --> 01:17:01.672
Of course, we were, uh...

1490
01:17:02.206 --> 01:17:03.742
Engaging in...

1491
01:17:04.876 --> 01:17:06.277
Rather heavy petting,

1492
01:17:06.309 --> 01:17:11.883
that led to full-blown,
penetrative intercourse.


1493
01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:13.084
Are you insane?

1494
01:17:13.117 --> 01:17:15.720
I am right here,
and that didn't happen.


1495
01:17:20.892 --> 01:17:21.926
Could have happened.

1496
01:17:25.028 --> 01:17:26.430
Hey!

1497
01:17:26.464 --> 01:17:28.133
Don't let him get away!

1498
01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:30.402
Oh!

1499
01:17:34.037 --> 01:17:37.642
<i>I'm sure you can guess who
actually did destroy the squirrel.</i>


1500
01:17:50.921 --> 01:17:54.759
<i>By dinner time, everyone just
forgot their race-based witch-hunt,</i>


1501
01:17:54.791 --> 01:17:57.194
<i>their xenophobic rush
to judgment,</i>


1502
01:17:57.228 --> 01:18:00.165
<i>their ethnically-motivated
vigilantism...</i>


1503
01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:01.700
<i>You get the point.</i>

1504
01:18:01.733 --> 01:18:04.169
Tim Long, you stand up for me.

1505
01:18:04.202 --> 01:18:05.804
In front of the whole town.

1506
01:18:07.505 --> 01:18:09.941
These people, they hate you.

1507
01:18:09.974 --> 01:18:11.176
No, I...

1508
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:12.309
I wouldn't say "Hate."

1509
01:18:12.343 --> 01:18:13.176
<i>Oui. Oui, oui.</i>

1510
01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:15.245
They said terrible things
about you.


1511
01:18:15.278 --> 01:18:18.348
"Tim Long is a bookworm."
"Tim Long is a loser."


1512
01:18:18.381 --> 01:18:22.352
"Tim Long is needle-dicked,
four-eyes shit boy."


1513
01:18:22.385 --> 01:18:24.188
I actually haven't heard
that one.


1514
01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:26.457
Terrible things.
Me, I don't say these things


1515
01:18:26.491 --> 01:18:27.567
- because...
- Who said "Shit boy?"


1516
01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:31.062
Well, once, because we are
<i>meilleurs copains.</i>


1517
01:18:31.094 --> 01:18:32.430
<i>Meilleurs copains.</i>

1518
01:18:34.799 --> 01:18:35.801
I guess we are.

1519
01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.975
Oh, God. Okay. I've gotta...

1520
01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:48.912
I gotta do something.

1521
01:18:48.946 --> 01:18:51.249
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

1522
01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:53.984
Go get her, Tim Long.

1523
01:18:58.956 --> 01:19:02.260
Why didn't you tell me about the
business going in the crapper?


1524
01:19:03.227 --> 01:19:04.729
'Cause I'm an idiot.

1525
01:19:06.029 --> 01:19:07.866
We might have to sell the house.

1526
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.834
Mmm.

1527
01:19:09.867 --> 01:19:11.970
We've rented before.

1528
01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:15.005
Maybe your mom will die soon too.
She's got cash, right?


1529
01:19:19.943 --> 01:19:21.011
We'll figure it out.

1530
01:19:21.379 --> 01:19:22.747
We always do.

1531
01:19:24.816 --> 01:19:26.984
We still got
what's most important.


1532
01:19:32.389 --> 01:19:35.993
You're... You're talking about
us being together, right?


1533
01:19:36.027 --> 01:19:38.462
- Yes, Glenn.
- Yeah.


1534
01:19:38.496 --> 01:19:41.767
Well, maybe we should tell Tim
that we've patched things up.


1535
01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.435
Oh, I mean...

1536
01:19:45.469 --> 01:19:48.139
We've started the difficult
and painful journey


1537
01:19:48.171 --> 01:19:50.008
towards patching things up.

1538
01:19:50.041 --> 01:19:51.042
Yeah.

1539
01:19:53.978 --> 01:19:55.380
Yeah, yeah. Good.

1540
01:19:57.915 --> 01:19:58.917
Hello, Tim Long.

1541
01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:05.322
I thought what you did
today was not un-heroic,


1542
01:20:05.355 --> 01:20:06.992
and maybe...

1543
01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.863
I... I... I'm really
sorry, Brenda.


1544
01:20:12.897 --> 01:20:17.402
I... I do like your hair,
and your crazy songs, and I...


1545
01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.415
Hi.

1546
01:20:31.448 --> 01:20:33.585
Don't let us stop you.

1547
01:20:33.617 --> 01:20:36.187
They were watching
the whole time?


1548
01:20:36.219 --> 01:20:37.297
It's a good technique, huh?

1549
01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:38.857
Not bad.

1550
01:20:38.889 --> 01:20:41.191
I can... I can feel
you looking. Please stop.


1551
01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:43.594
I don't know...
I don't know why you're staring.


1552
01:20:43.627 --> 01:20:45.197
We're very proud of you.

1553
01:20:56.974 --> 01:20:58.009
All right.

1554
01:20:59.644 --> 01:21:01.279
All right.

1555
01:21:01.312 --> 01:21:03.314
- "All right" what?
- Just hold still.


1556
01:21:03.346 --> 01:21:04.549
Okay.

1557
01:21:17.127 --> 01:21:21.432
<i>The rest of Stephane's stay
with us was, well, kind of terrific.</i>


1558
01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:24.035
<i>Some of the best times
I've ever had.</i>


1559
01:21:29.572 --> 01:21:31.107
You know, if you look closely,

1560
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:36.547
you can see the framing's really been
influenced by Godard and Truffaut...


1561
01:21:38.482 --> 01:21:40.518
I made a mistake. Okay?

1562
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:43.220
So, you haul me in.

1563
01:21:43.254 --> 01:21:45.657
If the coach hadn't dropped
me for the play-offs,


1564
01:21:45.689 --> 01:21:47.658
you wouldn't be staring
at me right here,


1565
01:21:47.692 --> 01:21:49.961
broken, humiliated, soiled.

1566
01:21:51.127 --> 01:21:54.331
<i>But like all of life's
loveliest things,</i>


1567
01:21:54.365 --> 01:21:56.300
<i>it was over way too soon.</i>

1568
01:21:56.334 --> 01:21:57.969
Oh, I'm so sorry we weren't up

1569
01:21:58.001 --> 01:21:59.569
to your high standards,
Jean-Claude...


1570
01:21:59.603 --> 01:22:03.441
Terrible cuisine, terrible
town, terrible country.


1571
01:22:04.041 --> 01:22:05.543
Screw you!

1572
01:22:05.576 --> 01:22:07.045
Let's go.

1573
01:22:09.479 --> 01:22:10.580
Hey, look.

1574
01:22:10.613 --> 01:22:12.482
It's the Hobart posse, huh?

1575
01:22:12.515 --> 01:22:14.184
Hey!

1576
01:22:14.218 --> 01:22:16.520
There you are.

1577
01:22:16.554 --> 01:22:18.189
We came to say goodbye.

1578
01:22:19.322 --> 01:22:20.491
And we're sorry.

1579
01:22:21.358 --> 01:22:24.294
We drew certain conclusions

1580
01:22:24.327 --> 01:22:26.096
based on you being different.

1581
01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:27.198
And that's wrong.

1582
01:22:28.264 --> 01:22:30.567
In Hobart, we pride ourselves

1583
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.269
in treating everyone equally,

1584
01:22:32.303 --> 01:22:34.372
regardless of race.

1585
01:22:40.377 --> 01:22:41.679
Oh, you're being serious.

1586
01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:44.314
What we mean is, uh,

1587
01:22:44.348 --> 01:22:46.216
we were wrong.

1588
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:48.319
I will miss this Hobart.

1589
01:22:48.352 --> 01:22:50.520
I want to make love
on all of you.


1590
01:22:50.554 --> 01:22:51.989
Thank you.

1591
01:22:52.022 --> 01:22:53.758
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, this is the last call</i>


1592
01:22:53.791 --> 01:22:56.328
<i>for flight number 827 to Paris.</i>

1593
01:22:59.063 --> 01:23:00.074
We're gonna miss you, buddy.

1594
01:23:00.098 --> 01:23:02.634
<i>Bonne chance,</i>
my brown-skinned friend.


1595
01:23:07.804 --> 01:23:09.540
We are <i>meilleurs copains.</i>

1596
01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:11.241
Best friends.

1597
01:23:15.179 --> 01:23:16.181
I'll go now.

1598
01:23:17.113 --> 01:23:18.116
Yeah.

1599
01:23:23.653 --> 01:23:24.755
I'll write to you.

1600
01:23:24.788 --> 01:23:26.456
I'll write to you, Tim Long.

1601
01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:28.459
And I'll use the big words
you teach me.


1602
01:23:28.492 --> 01:23:29.661
Diaphanous.

1603
01:23:30.827 --> 01:23:32.763
<i>Stephane might not
have been what I wanted,</i>


1604
01:23:32.796 --> 01:23:34.765
<i>but it turned out
he was what I needed.</i>


1605
01:23:34.799 --> 01:23:37.234
<i>And I think he needed me too.</i>

1606
01:23:37.268 --> 01:23:39.636
<i>He might not have
enlightened me on Truffaut</i>


1607
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:41.506
- <i>or how to conjugate a verb...</i>
- Hey.


1608
01:23:41.538 --> 01:23:44.207
<i>But he taught me things
I'll never forget.</i>


1609
01:23:44.241 --> 01:23:45.343
<i>About love,</i>

1610
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:47.612

<i>second chances...</i>

1612
01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:51.015
- Bye, Stephane.
- Bye, Tim Long.


1613
01:23:52.183 --> 01:23:54.484
<i>And how to undo
a bra with one hand.</i>


1614
01:23:54.518 --> 01:23:55.586
Sexy nerd couple.

1615
01:24:12.402 --> 01:24:14.638
Tim Long,
are you wearing cologne?


1616
01:24:15.706 --> 01:24:18.443
Yeah. Yeah, well,
you know what they say.


1617
01:24:18.475 --> 01:24:22.346
"Before sex happens in the
pants, it happens in the nose."


1618
01:24:23.113 --> 01:24:25.383
Oh.

1619
01:24:26.349 --> 01:24:27.852
<i>As I waved goodbye,</i>

1620
01:24:27.885 --> 01:24:31.722
<i>I didn't know whether
it was</i> au revoir <i>or</i> adieu.


1621
01:24:31.755 --> 01:24:34.592
<i>But I did know that
Stephane had changed my life...</i>


1622
01:24:35.225 --> 01:24:36.227
<i>Forever.</i>

1623
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:50.808
Bonjour! <i>We made it to Paris,</i>

1624
01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.711
<i>my dream city, the heart of all
culture and all that is good.</i>


1625
01:24:54.745 --> 01:24:56.613
<i>We made it. 
We made it.</i>

1626
01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.216
<i>Tim, look.</i>

1627
01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:01.252
<i>I made the Eiffel Tower my cock.</i>

1628
01:25:01.285 --> 01:25:02.252
<i>I know.</i>

1629
01:25:02.286 --> 01:25:04.721
<i>Hey, Tim, you come
jerk me off, huh?</i>


1630
01:25:04.755 --> 01:25:06.491
<i>It'd be funny. 
You jerk me off.</i>

1631
01:25:06.523 --> 01:25:08.759
<i>Okay. When in Paris.</i>

1632
01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:09.961
<i>Yeah.</i>
