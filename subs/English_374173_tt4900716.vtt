1
00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:23.669
Dharmendra!

2
00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:25.252
- Pick up these plates!

3
00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:27.627
Bring the potatoes
out when they're done.


4
00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:30.794
- Have you cleaned the bathroom?
It was filthy yesterday!


5
00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.211
- Dharmendra!

6
00:02:37.377 --> 00:02:40.377
- Hang the clothes
to dry... the sun's out!


7
00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:45.419
Do you need anything, Dad?

8
00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:51.086
Forget your papers for a
minute and concentrate on him...


9
00:02:51.252 --> 00:02:54.377
He's been rehearsing
his death for a week now.


10
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:55.919
You think he listens to me?

11
00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:58.252
As if me saying anything
will make a difference...


12
00:02:58.627 --> 00:02:59.544
What the hell?

13
00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.211
Don't pour the damn tea
so close to the accounts papers!


14
00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:03.752
Ridiculous...

15
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:06.752
All we have are accounts papers.

16
00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:08.377
God alone knows when
we'll see some money.


17
00:03:08.461 --> 00:03:11.794
It'll come when these
snide comments stop.


18
00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:14.794
Did you see this?

19
00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:16.794
Last month's electricity bill.

20
00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:18.252
6,478 rupees...

21
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:20.002
Just one month,
not the whole year!


22
00:03:20.086 --> 00:03:22.711
Can't switch the damn
TV off for a second!


23
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:23.961
"No money, no money!"

24
00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:25.252
I have an idea...

25
00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:26.752
Let's get rid of
the lights and fans...


26
00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:27.877
No electricity, no bill!

27
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.794
I said TV- Why can't
you give a straight answer?!


28
00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.127
By the way,
have you called the plumber?


29
00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:35.044
Oh, don't worry...

30
00:03:35.127 --> 00:03:36.919
The tap's only been
leaking for 3 days now...


31
00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:38.961
We'll call him when
the house is a pool.


32
00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:40.252
His number's right here.

33
00:03:40.336 --> 00:03:42.419
You too could have called him.

34
00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:44.711
This is the limit...

35
00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.794
Dharmendra!

36
00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:49.044
Go see what's happened now!

37
00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:54.169
Day before he was lying in
the lawn with ketchup on his chest.


38
00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:55.836
- When the neighbours came to check...

39
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:58.169
...he said let's go for dinner...
I mean, really!


40
00:04:02.627 --> 00:04:04.086
I don't know what to say, Rahul!

41
00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.627
I don't know what
to tell the publishers!


42
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.461
Your deadline is in two months!

43
00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:09.252
Listen, I'm just
re-working the ending...


44
00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:10.919
I'm fixing the plot points...

45
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.294
I wasn't quite happy with it.

46
00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:15.752
I've been a bit pre-occupied
with that Artist Retreat thing.


47
00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.794
I'm happy for you that the
Artist Retreat is coming together.


48
00:04:18.877 --> 00:04:21.919
I really am happy and I
know that you can multi-task...


49
00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:25.002
But right now I need a moment
as your agent and not as your friend.


50
00:04:25.086 --> 00:04:25.836
Okay?

51
00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.669
Listen, I'm not your friend;
I'm your agent...


52
00:04:27.752 --> 00:04:30.419
And as your agent I'm telling you,
that you're hot property right now.


53
00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:32.127
Your last book is
still on the shelves.


54
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:34.169
I've got you a sweet
deal for this new book...


55
00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:37.086
If you miss that deadline,
you have to return the advance.


56
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:38.211
Okay, I get it, I get.

57
00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:40.961
I promise in the next

58
00:04:41.127 --> 00:04:42.211
20 days!

59
00:04:42.377 --> 00:04:44.461
- 20 days.
- Oh, that reminds me...


60
00:04:44.544 --> 00:04:48.294
I need you to sign these
for my friends who love your work...


61
00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:51.461
I don't know why,
but I just need you to sign them.


62
00:04:52.044 --> 00:04:53.586
Oh... Just give me a second...

63
00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:54.752
It's my Dad.

64
00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.002
On! Say hi!

65
00:04:57.127 --> 00:04:58.377
Hi, Dad.

66
00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:01.669
What?!

67
00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:05.794
Hey, Mike!
Two vodka's coming up!


68
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:13.711
Tonight's Ladies' Night!
You guys like the music?


69
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.294
I'll tell the DJ!

70
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:16.627
Cheers, guys!

71
00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:19.461
Don't drink and drive, alright?!
- Yeah, we'll be safe. Hey, Mike!


72
00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:25.544
- Hey, Mike!

73
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:33.377
Working late tonight?

74
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:35.502
Hey... Yeah,
just sending a few e-mails...


75
00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.377
- Okay. See you tomorrow!
- Bye, see you tomorrow Natalie...


76
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:39.836
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!


77
00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:49.211
Hello?

78
00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:51.086
Arjun, where are you, man?

79
00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:53.002
Why aren't you
answering your phone?


80
00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.461
Why? What happened?

81
00:05:54.544 --> 00:05:56.794
Dad called...
Dadu's had a heart attack...


82
00:05:56.877 --> 00:05:57.794
Shit...

83
00:05:58.294 --> 00:05:59.252
Is he okay?

84
00:05:59.336 --> 00:06:02.294
Yeah, he's stable now...
But he's still in the ICU...


85
00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:04.086
Why didn't they call me?

86
00:06:04.502 --> 00:06:05.461
Arjun...

87
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:07.627
I don't have time
for your childishness.


88
00:06:07.877 --> 00:06:10.544
I'm taking an Air India
flight day after...


89
00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:11.419
It'll arrive at 2 pm.

90
00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:12.419
- And I checked...

91
00:06:12.502 --> 00:06:14.294
- If you take the 7.40 flight
from New Jersey...


92
00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:16.377
...we can leave
the airport together.


93
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:17.586
Hold on.

94
00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:21.669
7.40... New Jersey...

95
00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:25.169
Arjun...

96
00:06:25.377 --> 00:06:27.086
It's alright, man,
I can buy you the ticket...


97
00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.252
No need... I'll manage.
Bye.


98
00:06:31.502 --> 00:06:33.086
Okay fine... Bye.

99
00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:57.961
" Arjun!

100
00:07:07.377 --> 00:07:08.669
How are you?

101
00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:15.502
Where's your bag?

102
00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:30.752
Hello?

103
00:07:31.627 --> 00:07:32.877
Where are you'll?

104
00:07:33.086 --> 00:07:34.544
- We're already here...

105
00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:38.669
- Can't find the keys...
- They aren't under the mat.


106
00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.627
Ahh... Found it.

107
00:07:43.002 --> 00:07:44.627
- Okay see you'll soon.

108
00:07:48.044 --> 00:07:49.377
Hey, Geishu!

109
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.419
Shake hands!
Yes! Good boy!


110
00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:56.169
What's up?!

111
00:07:57.294 --> 00:07:58.919
- Missed you...

112
00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:43.086
What?

113
00:08:50.086 --> 00:08:51.002
Rahul!

114
00:08:51.086 --> 00:08:51.669
Rahul!

115
00:08:51.752 --> 00:08:53.961
Arj- Oho!
Rahul!


116
00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:57.086
- How are you?
- How are you?


117
00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:59.086
So good to see you!

118
00:08:59.294 --> 00:09:01.711
What's this new look!

119
00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:04.586
- How was the flight?
- It was alright!


120
00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:07.002
- His bag got left behind.
- Where's your bag?


121
00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:09.252
Actually, the airline lost my bags...

122
00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:11.627
Are you sure it was
the airline and not you?


123
00:09:12.544 --> 00:09:13.586
- How's Dadu?

124
00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:16.669
- Uhh... He's okay...
- He's old now, no...


125
00:09:16.752 --> 00:09:18.294
He'll be under observation
for a couple of days...


126
00:09:18.377 --> 00:09:19.461
Can we meet him now?

127
00:09:19.544 --> 00:09:20.461
- Now?
- Yeah...


128
00:09:20.544 --> 00:09:23.336
Visiting hours are over now...
Go see him in the morning.


129
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:25.669
I'll stay there tonight.

130
00:09:25.752 --> 00:09:27.669
Oh God, Who did this?!

131
00:09:27.877 --> 00:09:29.294
Who's dirty shoe prints are these?

132
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.419
- Mom... it's...

133
00:09:31.669 --> 00:09:33.002
Geishu! Bad dog!

134
00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:36.294
- Morn, he'll clean it up.
- The house rules are the same!


135
00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:38.419
- Nothing's changed!
- Where's Uncle?


136
00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:40.044
- He's on a cruise...

137
00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:42.877
- No network 'til they dock.

138
00:09:44.252 --> 00:09:45.294
How's work?

139
00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:48.586
- I'll make it in two minutes!
- I'm going to shower.


140
00:09:48.752 --> 00:09:50.086
What's wrong?

141
00:09:50.836 --> 00:09:51.919
I made okra...

142
00:09:52.002 --> 00:09:54.419
Such a fussy boy...
I love okra!


143
00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.752
- What else did you make?
- Come, see...


144
00:09:58.044 --> 00:10:00.169
Who's going to clean this mess? Arjun!

145
00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:02.544
- Very nice.

146
00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:07.752
So this is a place for
creative people to work in peace?


147
00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:08.919
Yup.

148
00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:11.377
- Nice.
- Artist Retreat...


149
00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:13.461
The investors are almost ready.

150
00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:15.544
How's the novel coming along?

151
00:10:16.044 --> 00:10:17.586
There's some work left...

152
00:10:17.836 --> 00:10:20.336
Actually, I'm lying...
There's a lot of work left.


153
00:10:20.544 --> 00:10:22.794
- God knows how you
manage so much work...


154
00:10:23.127 --> 00:10:25.086
- I owe it all to your okra.
- Drink?


155
00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:26.419
- Yeah...
- Arjun?


156
00:10:26.502 --> 00:10:27.544
- Nah, thanks, Dad...

157
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.252
Okay, Arjun... Apple pie?

158
00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:31.294
Did you make this?

159
00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:34.502
I did...but it's
Timmy Aunty's recipe...


160
00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:37.586
How's her catering business doing?

161
00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:38.877
- Oh, wonderful...

162
00:10:39.294 --> 00:10:43.502
In fact she thinks I
should open a branch here...


163
00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:44.961
- You should!
- Why not, Ma!


164
00:10:45.044 --> 00:10:46.336
- You should!
- Really?


165
00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:48.544
In fact, all her recipes are superb...

166
00:10:49.002 --> 00:10:50.544
They're not that great...

167
00:10:51.336 --> 00:10:53.336
- Cheers...
- Cheers, Dad...


168
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:56.919
She earns your annual
income in 3 months...


169
00:10:57.002 --> 00:10:57.877
Here we go...

170
00:10:57.961 --> 00:11:01.086
So it makes no difference
if you think it's great or not...


171
00:11:01.836 --> 00:11:02.711
Morn...

172
00:11:02.877 --> 00:11:04.836
No no, but she's right!

173
00:11:05.252 --> 00:11:06.961
What difference does it make?

174
00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:09.794
- It's really nice...

175
00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:11.419
There's lots more!

176
00:11:13.086 --> 00:11:14.544
- Arjun?

177
00:11:14.836 --> 00:11:16.877
You've only been on your
phone since you got here.


178
00:11:17.502 --> 00:11:19.252
- Why don't you
talk to us a little...

179
00:11:19.377 --> 00:11:20.836
Or do you have nothing to say?

180
00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:22.544
No, no... Tell me...

181
00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:25.127
How's the website job going?

182
00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:30.502
Ummm... I actually
quit that last month...


183
00:11:31.627 --> 00:11:32.711
- You quit?
- Why?


184
00:11:33.377 --> 00:11:34.752
I mean...

185
00:11:35.086 --> 00:11:36.127
- So now?

186
00:11:36.544 --> 00:11:38.669
Now, I'm concentrating
on my writing...


187
00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:40.711
Finishing my novel...

188
00:11:41.294 --> 00:11:43.544
- Finishing?
- Yeah, almost...


189
00:11:44.627 --> 00:11:45.627
Great...

190
00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:46.711
- Good show!

191
00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:49.086
Everyone in this
family's a novelist now.


192
00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:53.544
Shouldn't you have asked before
taking such a big decision?


193
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:55.336
- We could have discussed it?

194
00:11:55.419 --> 00:11:58.211
Dad... What do you know about my work?
What would I ask?


195
00:11:58.377 --> 00:12:00.961
You're right...
What do I know about anything?


196
00:12:01.127 --> 00:12:02.294
- You could have asked Rahul!

197
00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:03.544
- Dad...
- Dad!


198
00:12:03.627 --> 00:12:04.836
Dad, please don't
interfere with my work...


199
00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:06.211
I'm interfering?

200
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.419
- Harsh...
- Talk properly...


201
00:12:07.502 --> 00:12:09.211
- Harsh!
- What "Harsh, Harsh"?!


202
00:12:09.294 --> 00:12:12.169
- The poor child just got here...
- He quits something every month...


203
00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:13.836
Stop, man, please!

204
00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:14.461
- Arjun...

205
00:12:14.544 --> 00:12:16.544
I'll eat in my room from now,
if all you'll do is pick on me


206
00:12:16.627 --> 00:12:18.169
Oh, sorry...
I don't have a room anymore, right?


207
00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:20.336
- Arjun!
- Arjun, it's just a few days, man...


208
00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:21.252
Sleep in my room!

209
00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:23.669
You seem to care more about
your room than your career.


210
00:12:23.752 --> 00:12:24.836
Dad!

211
00:12:25.127 --> 00:12:26.502
- Why do you guys do this Ma?
- What could I do?


212
00:12:26.586 --> 00:12:29.127
The doctor's told me
to sleep on a hard mattress...


213
00:12:29.252 --> 00:12:30.836
It's okay, Ma.

214
00:12:39.127 --> 00:12:41.377
I'm going back to the hospital...

215
00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.002
- Straight there?
- Yes, straight there.


216
00:12:44.752 --> 00:12:45.836
Ma...

217
00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:49.211
- ls there any green tea?
- Green tea?


218
00:12:49.794 --> 00:12:51.169
Since when do you drink green tea?

219
00:12:51.252 --> 00:12:52.877
I got you this...

220
00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:55.961
That's beautiful!

221
00:12:56.127 --> 00:12:58.461
- You like it?
- Of course!


222
00:12:59.002 --> 00:13:01.627
That's lovely...

223
00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:05.669
- My perfect child.
- That I am...


224
00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:11.377
Can't believe the state of this car.
It looks like a junkyard..


225
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:13.919
<i>
- By the Way"-</i>

226
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.544
Morn said she shifted to your
room to sleep on a different mattress.


227
00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:18.169
But both the rooms
have the same mattress.


228
00:13:18.252 --> 00:13:19.461
What?!

229
00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:21.377
The same mattress in both rooms?!

230
00:13:21.586 --> 00:13:22.919
- What now, Sherlock?

231
00:13:23.086 --> 00:13:25.336
Dude... Morn and Dad
are sleeping separately.


232
00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:28.336
You would too if you lived in
the same room as Dad for 35 years.


233
00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:29.669
That's my pen, man!

234
00:13:29.794 --> 00:13:31.794
Leave this damn music
system and watch the road!


235
00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.419
If it bothers you so much
maybe you should learn how to drive.


236
00:13:33.502 --> 00:13:35.169
- I know how to drive...
- Yeah, right...


237
00:13:35.336 --> 00:13:37.127
I'm just not comfortable driving.

238
00:13:43.627 --> 00:13:44.377
What is this?!

239
00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:46.752
Toll is 30 rupees,
this is your change.


240
00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:56.044
Oho!!! Stop moving!

241
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.169
It tickles!

242
00:13:57.252 --> 00:13:59.502
How will she tie your gown?!

243
00:13:59.794 --> 00:14:01.127
Get lost, fatty!

244
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:04.044
- Dad, what are you doing-
- She just wants to see me naked!


245
00:14:04.627 --> 00:14:05.419
Sorry, sorry...

246
00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:06.752
- Why am I wearing an apron?!

247
00:14:07.086 --> 00:14:10.877
I was an army man for 21 years!

248
00:14:11.002 --> 00:14:13.461
You'll get your pants
back when you're discharged!


249
00:14:13.544 --> 00:14:15.377
Yeah, right... Hey, fatty!

250
00:14:15.502 --> 00:14:16.377
Stop it, Dad...

251
00:14:16.586 --> 00:14:17.669
Dadu!

252
00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:18.502
There they are.

253
00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:20.419
Welcome, kids!

254
00:14:20.752 --> 00:14:23.461
Hey, hey! Don't you dare... Hands up!

255
00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:24.794
- I said, hands up!

256
00:14:24.877 --> 00:14:26.544
- This is a hospital, Dad...
- We're not kids anymore...


257
00:14:26.669 --> 00:14:27.669
Ahhhh!

258
00:14:27.877 --> 00:14:28.711
You also!

259
00:14:30.127 --> 00:14:31.336
Hey, fatty!

260
00:14:32.627 --> 00:14:34.252
- Die fatty die!

261
00:14:34.502 --> 00:14:35.877
Stupid fatty...

262
00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:41.877
Get up, kids...
Your mother's here...


263
00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:44.752
What are you two doing?!
Behaving like 5 year olds...


264
00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:46.169
Hello, Dadu...

265
00:14:46.502 --> 00:14:48.336
Welcome, welcome!

266
00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.377
Wow...

267
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:52.669
- Excuse me!

268
00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:55.252
This hospital has a great
psychiatric department...


269
00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:56.627
- Please take him there!

270
00:14:58.294 --> 00:14:59.502
It's not funny, okay!

271
00:14:59.586 --> 00:15:01.169
- Oh, come on...
- Apologise to her!


272
00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:02.461
Sorry, you big fat cow!

273
00:15:02.627 --> 00:15:04.752
Who are you calling a cow?!

274
00:15:05.752 --> 00:15:08.669
- How was the flight?
- It was good, Dadu...


275
00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:11.836
Just latch this here, and prick...

276
00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:14.669
Ow, you idiot!
Are you trying to kill me?!


277
00:15:14.752 --> 00:15:16.669
You can check your
sugar without blood tests!


278
00:15:16.752 --> 00:15:19.086
- What kind of gift is this!
- Well, what do you want?!


279
00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.127
Dadu...

280
00:15:22.419 --> 00:15:25.169
What are you laughing at, rascal?
What did you get me?


281
00:15:27.211 --> 00:15:28.419
Urn... chocolate?

282
00:15:28.544 --> 00:15:29.877
- Chocolate!
- Arjun!


283
00:15:30.002 --> 00:15:32.044
His sugar has to go up
to use your lovely machine!


284
00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:33.044
Exactly!

285
00:15:33.127 --> 00:15:35.419
Arjun! What's going on?

286
00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:40.086
Make yourself useful...
Go make this payment...


287
00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:41.627
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:44.544
Please wait.

289
00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:50.627
Hey, Wasim!

290
00:15:53.461 --> 00:15:54.877
Arjun!

291
00:15:55.502 --> 00:15:56.586
How are you, man?!

292
00:15:56.669 --> 00:15:57.919
When did you get here?
Should have called!


293
00:15:58.002 --> 00:16:00.044
I landed yesterday, man...

294
00:16:00.127 --> 00:16:01.044
What are you doing here?

295
00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.377
Dadu had a heart attack...

296
00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:03.877
Dadu... He's alive?!

297
00:16:04.044 --> 00:16:06.502
- Ass! I'll hit you!
- How's he doing?


298
00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:08.919
He's okay now... What are
you doing here? All okay?


299
00:16:09.044 --> 00:16:11.502
Ummm... hemorrhoids...

300
00:16:12.502 --> 00:16:13.377
What?!

301
00:16:13.836 --> 00:16:15.544
Hemorrhoids, man!

302
00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:18.336
Don't laugh, jerk!

303
00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:20.586
You ran away to the US and I'm
stuck here doing photography!


304
00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:23.419
Rotting all day in dad's studio...
Smile and click, smile and click!


305
00:16:23.502 --> 00:16:24.752
You're chilling in life, man!

306
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:27.586
Really?! Come to the studio
and see the stunners of Coonoor!


307
00:16:27.669 --> 00:16:28.919
Of course! Let's catch up soon!

308
00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:30.336
Come tonight!

309
00:16:30.419 --> 00:16:32.086
- Tonight...
- Remember Malik's bungalow?


310
00:16:32.169 --> 00:16:33.211
Malik...

311
00:16:34.502 --> 00:16:36.294
That's where the party is! Come!

312
00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:37.919
I can't, man... 
Family scene...

313
00:16:38.002 --> 00:16:40.086
How can you ditch a party, bro...

314
00:16:40.544 --> 00:16:43.169
Bro, isn't that your brother? Boobly?

315
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:44.252
- What's he doing?!

316
00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:47.669
- Don't ask, man... He's training for some
Mr. Ooty bodybuilding competition...


317
00:16:47.752 --> 00:16:49.669
- Whose child is this?
- Hi, Boobly!


318
00:16:50.752 --> 00:16:53.752
Why don't you check out some
properties for your retreat here?


319
00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:56.461
- Why not?
- I'll talk to the broker.


320
00:16:56.586 --> 00:16:58.502
I said, switch off your phone!

321
00:16:59.544 --> 00:17:00.752
Yes... and put some adhesive there...

322
00:17:00.836 --> 00:17:02.836
- What's happening?
- And what about this leak here?


323
00:17:03.044 --> 00:17:06.169
He'll take care of it!
He's a professional, we're paying him!


324
00:17:06.377 --> 00:17:07.252
He'll handle it.

325
00:17:07.336 --> 00:17:09.627
- The bucket's full...
- I am aware.


326
00:17:10.336 --> 00:17:11.461
Take lessons... 
She knows everything.

327
00:17:11.544 --> 00:17:13.211
- Geishu! Put him down!

328
00:17:13.294 --> 00:17:14.919
Not on the sofa.. Put him down!

329
00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:17.752
Arjun! the doctor's calling...
Empty this bucket...


330
00:17:17.877 --> 00:17:19.919
Dad! I have to
take Geishu for a walk...

331
00:17:20.002 --> 00:17:22.752
One second...
Arjun, don't be a useless fellow!


332
00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:24.086
Morn told me to!

333
00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.836
Dad, I'm coming... Let it be.

334
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:28.461
Come, Geishu!

335
00:17:29.544 --> 00:17:30.919
Tomorrow? Okay...

336
00:17:37.044 --> 00:17:38.169
Dad, I don't get it...

337
00:17:38.252 --> 00:17:40.502
If the doctors recommend
treating Dadu in Bangalore...


338
00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:41.377
What's the problem?

339
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:43.252
It's not so simple...

340
00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:46.627
It cost <i>7</i> lakh rupees
to put the stents in... 7!


341
00:17:46.752 --> 00:17:48.544
What happened to the advance
you were supposed to get?


342
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:51.502
It's still bloody stuck!
It'll come... Just taking time...


343
00:17:51.627 --> 00:17:53.419
But don't worry... 
I'll talk to Shashi...

344
00:17:53.502 --> 00:17:55.294
How can you keep asking
your younger brother for money?!


345
00:17:55.377 --> 00:17:56.502
Have some shame!

346
00:17:56.586 --> 00:17:59.044
What's shameful about it!
We're both his sons!


347
00:17:59.127 --> 00:18:00.627
Yes, except he takes
care of all the expenses!


348
00:18:00.752 --> 00:18:02.669
And where does Dad stay?
He doesn't take care of that!


349
00:18:02.752 --> 00:18:04.336
- You'll are unbelievable,
you'll fight over anything!


350
00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:08.211
All Shashi's college expenses
were handled by me! Harsh Kapoor!


351
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:10.127
- Morn, dad, please!

352
00:18:10.294 --> 00:18:13.086
No need!
We won't take money from Shashi.


353
00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:15.336
- Where will the money come from?
- Break my fixed deposit.


354
00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:18.086
Sir! Can you please help?

355
00:18:19.252 --> 00:18:20.752
- I'm coming...
- Ma please don't break your FD


356
00:18:20.836 --> 00:18:21.752
- Just hold this, please.

357
00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.669
What a mess you've made!
What the hell are you doing?


358
00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:25.544
- I can help with the money...
- No no no!


359
00:18:25.627 --> 00:18:27.336
You've been talking about
your investment forever...


360
00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:29.169
- It's alright...
- Rahul! Get a cloth!


361
00:18:29.252 --> 00:18:30.836
Yes! Getting it...

362
00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:36.669
Why can't we break my deposit?

363
00:18:36.752 --> 00:18:38.752
I had to pay the loan installment!
Where would I get that?


364
00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:40.211
From your imaginary
catering business?!


365
00:18:40.294 --> 00:18:41.836
- That was my money!
- Yeah, right...


366
00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.711
I've been saving for
my business for 3 years!


367
00:18:43.794 --> 00:18:44.794
What were you saving?!

368
00:18:44.877 --> 00:18:46.961
The money I give you
to run the house, right?


369
00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:47.502
So?

370
00:18:47.586 --> 00:18:48.669
- How is that your money?
- Dad, stop it!


371
00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:49.461
Leave me!

372
00:18:49.544 --> 00:18:50.961
- Where did you spend it?
- Morn...


373
00:18:51.044 --> 00:18:53.044
- Your business is in the dumps.
- Stop behaving like children...


374
00:18:53.127 --> 00:18:55.419
- Did you give it to Anu?
- Stop your nonsense!


375
00:18:55.502 --> 00:18:57.752
Hold this. I said, hold this!

376
00:18:58.169 --> 00:18:59.294
Are you insane?

377
00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:01.586
You sit here and concoct
these wild fantasies in your head!


378
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:02.586
Dad!

379
00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:04.127
Sir...

380
00:19:04.294 --> 00:19:05.336
Should I come later?

381
00:19:05.419 --> 00:19:07.752
- Oh, so Anu just happened
to get a new car?


382
00:19:07.877 --> 00:19:10.461
Smriti told me!
Where did Anu get that much money?


383
00:19:10.544 --> 00:19:12.627
- How would I know?!
- It just fell into her lap'?!


384
00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:15.044
Maybe it did!
Do I look like her accountant?


385
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:17.961
- Get up now! Enough! Get out!
- Dad...


386
00:19:18.127 --> 00:19:20.002
Not a chance!
Sit down and finish your work!


387
00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:21.752
- I said get up!
' Stop it!


388
00:19:21.836 --> 00:19:23.961
Fix this leak!
And switch off your damn phone!


389
00:19:24.044 --> 00:19:25.752
What's happening?
Everyone's at it without me today?


390
00:19:25.836 --> 00:19:27.211
This isn't the time for jokes.

391
00:19:27.544 --> 00:19:30.961
Dad, Morn... I've told you
I have some money... I can invest later!


392
00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:32.961
- Who needs money?
- Just stay out of it...


393
00:19:33.127 --> 00:19:34.294
I'm talking to Morn!

394
00:19:34.377 --> 00:19:36.669
Your father has blown up all my money!

395
00:19:36.836 --> 00:19:38.086
Now we have to beg your uncle.

396
00:19:38.169 --> 00:19:39.586
Enough, Sunita! 
That's enough!

397
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:41.336
- How much money do you need?
- You keep quiet.


398
00:19:41.419 --> 00:19:43.377
Arjun... I've told you already!

399
00:19:43.502 --> 00:19:46.586
We're discussing actual money and
not a packet of m&m's... Stay out of it!


400
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:47.836
It's not like I live off you!

401
00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:50.419
Just shut up! All of you!
I'm tired of you'll!


402
00:19:50.502 --> 00:19:51.711
I was better off at Timmy's!

403
00:19:51.794 --> 00:19:53.002
That's a lovely idea, Sunita...

404
00:19:53.086 --> 00:19:56.169
Last time you went for <i>2</i> months...
Go for 6 months now!


405
00:19:56.252 --> 00:19:58.086
Dad, stop shouting...
Tell me what the problem is!


406
00:19:58.169 --> 00:20:00.794
Arjun, do me a favour.
Handle your own problems!


407
00:20:00.877 --> 00:20:03.461
- Why are you always taunting me?!
- I'm not taunting you!


408
00:20:03.544 --> 00:20:04.752
- I'm done, sir!

409
00:20:05.336 --> 00:20:07.169
- Done? How much?

410
00:20:07.294 --> 00:20:09.752
Anything you can spare
in these tough times...


411
00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:12.877
- I'll slap this idiot...
- Dad, enough now!


412
00:20:13.044 --> 00:20:15.211
- Switch off your phone!
- It's your phone, Dad!


413
00:20:15.294 --> 00:20:17.252
I know it's my phone, I'm not deaf!

414
00:20:17.336 --> 00:20:18.502
Everyone thinks I'm
an idiot around here...


415
00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:20.127
You're not an idiot, 
I'm the idiot...

416
00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:21.711
No one's told me what's
happening since I got here!


417
00:20:21.794 --> 00:20:23.544
I'm always treated like an outsider!
Rahul, stop touching me!


418
00:20:23.627 --> 00:20:24.502
- Stay away!
- Arjun...


419
00:20:24.586 --> 00:20:26.252
I'm always the last to
find out what's happening here...


420
00:20:26.336 --> 00:20:28.294
You called Rahul to tell him
about Dadu... Not me! Why?!


421
00:20:28.377 --> 00:20:29.752
Because you always react like a child!

422
00:20:29.836 --> 00:20:31.794
- Shut up, Rahul!
- You shut up!


423
00:20:32.086 --> 00:20:32.919
Talk softly!

424
00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:35.794
Use your millions from
your "blog" to help out!


425
00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:38.752
You think you're a big shot
because you wrote some book?!


426
00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:40.419
Arjun! Stop!
Stop it!


427
00:20:40.502 --> 00:20:42.586
Only you and I know
the truth about you!


428
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:44.877
- I'll break his goddamn face!
- You've gone mad!


429
00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:47.461
Enough, mom! It's always me...

430
00:20:49.294 --> 00:20:51.211
- What are you doing?!
- What do you mean what am I doing?!


431
00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.419
All you'll want to
do is create a scene!


432
00:20:54.544 --> 00:20:56.336
Arjun... Arjun, listen, please...

433
00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:57.627
Arjun, listen to me!

434
00:20:57.711 --> 00:20:59.002
Morn, even you know he's a thief!

435
00:20:59.086 --> 00:21:01.377
You'll are both here
together after 5 years...


436
00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:03.377
Must you behave like bloody animals?!

437
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:06.252
Everything's always my fault, Ma!
Rahul is totally innocent!


438
00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:08.877
And everything was
just a co-incidence?


439
00:21:10.627 --> 00:21:11.794
Arjun, listen...

440
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:30.086
- Hi this is Wasim! Sorry,
can't talk now... Leave a message!


441
00:21:50.836 --> 00:21:52.252
- Guys! Guys! Come on!

442
00:21:52.419 --> 00:21:54.461
- Someone bet on Sahil!

443
00:21:54.544 --> 00:21:55.836
- You Will?

444
00:21:55.919 --> 00:21:58.627
- What kind of friends
do you have, man?!


445
00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:00.669
Someone put money on me, guys...
I've known you'll for years!


446
00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.461
- Come on, guys!
- Come on, guys...


447
00:22:05.336 --> 00:22:09.419
One second, one second! Guys!
I believe in Sahil! Put money on him!


448
00:22:09.586 --> 00:22:12.169
He has core strength!

449
00:22:14.044 --> 00:22:18.336
Aww man! Kishore!
Kishore the fuse is out again!


450
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:19.877
Fix it!!!

451
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:22.627
- We love you, Kishore!
- Ya, we love you very much!


452
00:22:22.711 --> 00:22:25.919
Now, listen. I'm betting on Sahil.
Twenty bucks!


453
00:22:26.086 --> 00:22:28.502
Twenty bucks!!! Good job, T!

454
00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:31.127
I'm putting 20 bucks...
Excuse me, it's a lot of money!


455
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:33.502
And he'll put money!
Come on!


456
00:22:33.627 --> 00:22:35.169
Come on, man!

457
00:22:35.377 --> 00:22:36.877
What the hell? Okay, you?

458
00:22:36.961 --> 00:22:39.044
Okay, excuse me.
You! He'll put money!


459
00:22:39.127 --> 00:22:41.086
He looks skinny,
but he has core strength!


460
00:22:41.169 --> 00:22:42.669
These guns have a lot of power!

461
00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:45.044
- Come on, come on!
- Alright... ya!


462
00:22:45.252 --> 00:22:46.377
Sahil! Ya? Ya!

463
00:22:49.627 --> 00:22:51.752
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil!

464
00:23:04.252 --> 00:23:06.127
Bunkoo,dude...
Your whole drink is on me!


465
00:23:06.336 --> 00:23:08.086
Shit...

466
00:23:09.377 --> 00:23:10.752
Bunkooo...

467
00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:18.419
Umm... sorry. I was just going out...

468
00:23:18.586 --> 00:23:22.127
I should be the one apologizing...
I lost your money!


469
00:23:22.461 --> 00:23:23.794
No, that's okay...

470
00:23:23.961 --> 00:23:27.294
Actually, I knew
Sahil has no core strength...


471
00:23:28.127 --> 00:23:29.794
Are you Sahil's friend?

472
00:23:30.836 --> 00:23:33.252
Umm... No... I'm Wasim's friend...

473
00:23:33.627 --> 00:23:34.794
Wasim?

474
00:23:35.461 --> 00:23:38.044
He knows the owners of this place.

475
00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:41.877
I'm the owner... 
I don't know Wasim.

476
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:43.377
Oh! Umm...

477
00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:46.169
I was just trying to call Wasim,
but I couldn't get through...


478
00:23:46.252 --> 00:23:47.169
One second.

479
00:23:47.294 --> 00:23:51.544
You're sitting here rolling this...
Gatecrashing my party...


480
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:54.086
Wasim must be here...
I couldn't find him...


481
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:56.044
- Seriously?

482
00:23:56.127 --> 00:23:57.336
Couldn't get through to him?

483
00:23:57.419 --> 00:24:00.086
Kishore! Kishore!
Kishore throw this guy out!


484
00:24:00.252 --> 00:24:01.877
Okay, I'll leave! I'm sorry!

485
00:24:01.961 --> 00:24:04.044
- Can I take that?
- No no no, this is going to stay here...


486
00:24:04.127 --> 00:24:07.502
I'm sorry, I was just having
a really bad day, so I thought...


487
00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:10.419
I'm sorry, what? Seriously? Leave!

488
00:24:10.502 --> 00:24:12.002
- I'm sorry, I know you're upset...
- Leave!


489
00:24:12.086 --> 00:24:14.252
Ya, okay I'm leaving...

490
00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:22.211
What's so funny?

491
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:26.086
I'm so sorry!

492
00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:29.669
Shit... I was just kidding!
I'm sorry!


493
00:24:30.252 --> 00:24:32.336
It's supposed to be funny! I'm sorry!

494
00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:34.044
<i>-</i> Okay...
<i>-</i> Ya!


495
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:36.711
- Listen, you're cool, right?
- Good one...


496
00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:37.544
Ya!

497
00:24:38.836 --> 00:24:41.086
- Do you have a lighter?
- Yeah, of course...


498
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:44.669
- I'm Arjun.

499
00:24:44.836 --> 00:24:46.127
Tia... Tia!

500
00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:47.627
- Hi...
- Hi!


501
00:24:54.836 --> 00:24:56.836
Why are you so troubled, Arjun?

502
00:24:58.711 --> 00:25:01.127
Don't ask...
I'm having such a rubbish day...


503
00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:03.086
Fought with your girlfriend?

504
00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:05.211
Then?

505
00:25:06.794 --> 00:25:08.252
With my brother.

506
00:25:08.544 --> 00:25:09.752
Your butler?

507
00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:11.044
Not butler, brother!

508
00:25:12.044 --> 00:25:13.961
Why would I fight with a butler?

509
00:25:14.294 --> 00:25:15.502
Actually... yeah!

510
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:17.919
And even if I did,
why would I sit here like this?!


511
00:25:18.086 --> 00:25:19.961
Point taken...

512
00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.711
This bungalow's been empty
for years... never seen you around...


513
00:25:23.794 --> 00:25:26.377
The tea state and this bungalow
belong to my grandfather...


514
00:25:26.502 --> 00:25:29.127
I've lived in Bombay since I was 5...
because of Dad's work.


515
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:30.544
So, planning to shift here?

516
00:25:30.627 --> 00:25:32.127
No! Planning to rent it out!

517
00:25:32.502 --> 00:25:34.877
But my best friend Bunkoo's
boyfriend is from Ooty...


518
00:25:34.961 --> 00:25:37.544
So I had to have one last party!

519
00:25:38.752 --> 00:25:40.127
O...kay?!

520
00:25:40.252 --> 00:25:41.752
- Wasim!
- One second...


521
00:25:42.127 --> 00:25:43.627
Bro? Are you okay?

522
00:25:43.711 --> 00:25:44.502
Wasim!

523
00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:46.252
Ya... Him! See? 
I was calling him?

524
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:47.919
- Are you okay?
- Ya...


525
00:25:48.002 --> 00:25:49.086
- You okay, bro?
- Ya...


526
00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:50.502
False alarm.

527
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:53.211
Wasim! Tia. Tia! Wasim.
- Hi Wasim!


528
00:25:53.336 --> 00:25:54.919
She's the owner of this place.

529
00:25:55.044 --> 00:25:56.461
What are you'll doing in the bathroom?

530
00:25:56.544 --> 00:25:58.169
- We were about to take a shower.
- What?!


531
00:25:59.252 --> 00:26:00.669
- Come on...
- Ya, one minute...


532
00:26:00.752 --> 00:26:01.877
- You okay, Wasim?
- I'm fine now.


533
00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:04.544
Tia! Come on,
let's get this party started!


534
00:26:04.627 --> 00:26:07.752
Okay! You're good?
Arjun, Wasim... let's go! Time to party!


535
00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:52.294
Guys! ls there an Arjun here?

536
00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:53.711
Ummm... me!

537
00:28:54.294 --> 00:28:55.794
Don't puke in the car, man!
Get out!


538
00:28:55.877 --> 00:28:57.169
I'll leave you here on the road!

539
00:28:57.377 --> 00:28:59.169
- What are you doing to me!

540
00:28:59.377 --> 00:29:02.544
- Man, couldn't you have
waited two minutes to throw up...


541
00:29:03.086 --> 00:29:04.794
- My day was finally
picking up at that party...


542
00:29:11.211 --> 00:29:13.544
The property agent's coming at 11.30.

543
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.836
He'll show you some places...

544
00:29:16.377 --> 00:29:20.336
Then go see Dadu and tell
him we're taking him to Bangalore.


545
00:29:20.794 --> 00:29:22.836
I'll figure out the money with Shashi.

546
00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:26.252
- You want tea?
- No, thanks... I'm fine.


547
00:29:28.169 --> 00:29:29.377
- Dad...
- Ya?


548
00:29:31.127 --> 00:29:33.752
Why did Morn stay with
Timmy Aunty for <i>2</i> months?


549
00:29:34.461 --> 00:29:36.961
- She came back, right?
- That's not what I asked, Dad...


550
00:29:37.461 --> 00:29:39.044
To belittle me, what else...

551
00:29:39.127 --> 00:29:42.044
Timmy started her catering
business after her divorce...


552
00:29:42.127 --> 00:29:44.169
Morn thinks she can do it too.

553
00:29:44.752 --> 00:29:48.086
How can she compare me
to that bloody wife-beater?!


554
00:29:49.586 --> 00:29:52.044
Do I drink like Timmy's ex?

555
00:29:52.627 --> 00:29:54.711
Have I ever hit her?
Abused her?


556
00:29:54.794 --> 00:29:57.044
Dad... Why do you always do this?

557
00:29:57.127 --> 00:29:58.586
You never listen to anyone.

558
00:29:58.711 --> 00:30:00.794
Morn only needs your
support... Nothing else.


559
00:30:00.877 --> 00:30:03.044
Really?
And what about me?


560
00:30:03.711 --> 00:30:06.169
Where was everyone
when I needed support?


561
00:30:07.169 --> 00:30:09.377
Everything was fine
'til I worked at the bank.


562
00:30:09.544 --> 00:30:12.461
I started this business
for you'll... For you. For her!


563
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:13.752
What's wrong with that?

564
00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:17.752
There is a financial crisis.
What can I possibly do?


565
00:30:18.002 --> 00:30:19.377
Kill myself?

566
00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:22.294
Dad, please...

567
00:30:23.586 --> 00:30:24.919
I'm tired...

568
00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:29.169
I know... and you're a good man.

569
00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:31.336
Everything will be okay, I promise.

570
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:33.086
Just one day at a time, okay?

571
00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:36.294
One day at a time...

572
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:37.877
Thanks,buddy.

573
00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:46.211
Sir, all of Coonoor's
best properties are with us.


574
00:30:46.294 --> 00:30:47.294
- Really?
- So don't worry...


575
00:30:47.377 --> 00:30:50.711
Yes, Mr. Makhija, somehow the
properties today didn't reflect that.


576
00:30:50.836 --> 00:30:52.086
You didn't like anything today, right?

577
00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:54.044
I'll have a fresh batch
ready for you tomorrow...


578
00:30:54.127 --> 00:30:57.002
Yes, please...
A quiet place for creative people...


579
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:59.711
- Not abandoned, haunted houses.
- Thank you.


580
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:02.419
Yeah, Nik!

581
00:31:10.461 --> 00:31:11.461
Woah!

582
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:13.586
- Rahul...
- Arjun?!


583
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:15.836
Dadu was getting bored, man...

584
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:18.169
Ohh, just take him
to a disco then, bro.


585
00:31:18.586 --> 00:31:19.877
Disco?

586
00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:22.294
The nurse is asking for
the reports... Go get them.


587
00:31:22.377 --> 00:31:23.919
Fine.

588
00:31:24.294 --> 00:31:26.169
- Dadu, I'm coming...
- This is a hospital!


589
00:31:26.252 --> 00:31:27.919
I want to go to a disco!

590
00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:29.336
- Tell me something...

591
00:31:30.544 --> 00:31:32.419
Why are you like this?

592
00:31:32.502 --> 00:31:33.544
Like what?

593
00:31:33.627 --> 00:31:35.252
Grumpy...

594
00:31:35.336 --> 00:31:40.044
Don't do this, don't do that,
not like this, not like that...


595
00:31:40.294 --> 00:31:43.336
Relax, son... Relax...

596
00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:45.877
Okay, I'm sorry...

597
00:31:46.794 --> 00:31:48.669
But trust me, whatever we do,
we do for you...


598
00:31:48.752 --> 00:31:50.377
That's true...

599
00:31:50.877 --> 00:31:54.169
And that's why, we're
taking you to Bangalore for treatment...


600
00:31:54.377 --> 00:31:57.711
I don't want to go anywhere!
I'm not going!


601
00:31:58.002 --> 00:32:00.961
Next week is my birthday!

602
00:32:01.377 --> 00:32:05.169
I want to celebrate
my birthday with my family.


603
00:32:05.252 --> 00:32:07.336
Happy Birthday, Dadu,
but your treatment is very important.


604
00:32:07.419 --> 00:32:10.419
- I don't want any treatment!

605
00:32:10.502 --> 00:32:13.627
I don't aspire to live much longer.

606
00:32:13.711 --> 00:32:16.127
When I go, I'll go like this -

607
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:24.211
- I'm right, son...

608
00:32:25.002 --> 00:32:27.252
- But if you do want
to do something for me...


609
00:32:27.419 --> 00:32:29.252
Then I have two wishes.

610
00:32:29.419 --> 00:32:30.544
Which are?

611
00:32:31.211 --> 00:32:35.669
The first is that,
when I die, don't light my pyre.


612
00:32:37.127 --> 00:32:38.336
So, what, you'll just lie there?

613
00:32:38.419 --> 00:32:39.586
No, duffer!

614
00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:41.086
Bury me!

615
00:32:41.544 --> 00:32:44.252
- With my friends from
my army regiment...


616
00:32:44.461 --> 00:32:46.252
In the army burial ground!

617
00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:48.169
Wow. And what's the other wish?

618
00:32:48.252 --> 00:32:56.252
The other one is, before I go,
I want a happy family photograph...


619
00:32:57.002 --> 00:32:59.752
- Which I can put on my wall...

620
00:33:00.127 --> 00:33:07.044
It should read -
'Kapoor and Sons, since 1921'.


621
00:33:07.544 --> 00:33:11.294
Very nice... The creative juices
are really flowing today, huh?


622
00:33:11.377 --> 00:33:14.336
Well, when Uncle gets here,
we can fulfill this wish.


623
00:33:14.419 --> 00:33:15.502
Okay!

624
00:33:19.836 --> 00:33:20.877
Listen, man...

625
00:33:21.794 --> 00:33:24.877
We're here only for a few days...
Let's not fight...


626
00:33:27.294 --> 00:33:29.419
I'm sorry for last night.

627
00:33:39.336 --> 00:33:40.877
- Here you go...Your toll...

628
00:33:40.961 --> 00:33:42.252
- What?

629
00:33:44.252 --> 00:33:46.127
And this is for the hospital... Sorry.

630
00:34:03.294 --> 00:34:04.377
So you're showing me
some places tomorrow, right?


631
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:05.669
- Rahul!
- I hope it's a nice place...


632
00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:07.377
Bye!

633
00:34:08.711 --> 00:34:10.127
- Yeah?
- Mom's calling you in.


634
00:34:10.211 --> 00:34:11.377
Okay... Thanks.

635
00:34:13.544 --> 00:34:14.752
- Listen!
- Yeah?


636
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:17.002
She wants a couple of cigarettes...

637
00:34:17.544 --> 00:34:19.169
Ha ha, very funny...

638
00:34:19.336 --> 00:34:20.461
Want to share?

639
00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:23.794
Thanks.

640
00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:28.627
What did the doctors say?

641
00:34:29.794 --> 00:34:32.419
- What difference does it make?
Ask me what Dadu said.


642
00:34:32.502 --> 00:34:33.419
What?

643
00:34:33.627 --> 00:34:35.461
He wants to get discharged
and celebrate his birthday at home...


644
00:34:35.544 --> 00:34:36.711
Really?!

645
00:34:37.002 --> 00:34:38.752
It's his 90th birthday, man...

646
00:34:39.502 --> 00:34:40.627
Let's do something!

647
00:34:41.294 --> 00:34:43.502
Actually, I was thinking
of the same thing...


648
00:34:43.836 --> 00:34:48.669
Like a surprise 90th birthday party?
It'll be nice...


649
00:34:48.961 --> 00:34:51.419
With the beautiful
grannies of Coonoor?


650
00:34:52.252 --> 00:34:54.461
No, with Russian strippers
and caviar.


651
00:34:54.544 --> 00:34:55.586
Stupid...

652
00:34:55.752 --> 00:34:58.919
Dunno about caviar, but Russian
strippers will make Dadu's day.


653
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:02.419
Remember when Morn found
Dadu's porn stash?


654
00:35:02.919 --> 00:35:05.252
Yeah, behind the pot!

655
00:35:05.586 --> 00:35:07.461
Tied up in a plastic bag...

656
00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:09.252
He's a crazy dude...

657
00:35:09.377 --> 00:35:11.211
One of those magazines were mine, man...

658
00:35:11.377 --> 00:35:12.002
No.

659
00:35:12.086 --> 00:35:12.961
Barely Legal.

660
00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:14.502
- Barely Legal?!
- Ya.


661
00:35:14.711 --> 00:35:15.919
Oh God...

662
00:35:16.461 --> 00:35:18.086
It was depressing!
My only magazine!


663
00:35:18.169 --> 00:35:19.877
But I managed...

664
00:35:20.836 --> 00:35:21.836
Ah...

665
00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:23.377
Still managing, huh?

666
00:35:23.502 --> 00:35:26.544
Doing really well,
actually... Practice makes perfect...


667
00:35:27.627 --> 00:35:29.669
Wait 'til I tell
Morn about your antics...


668
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.127
Look here!

669
00:35:32.127 --> 00:35:33.211
Thanks...

670
00:35:33.669 --> 00:35:34.627
'Barely Perfect'...

671
00:35:34.752 --> 00:35:36.627
- Wait 'til I tell Morn.
- What are you doing, man?


672
00:35:36.711 --> 00:35:38.502
- Nothing, just photoshop.
- Delete it!


673
00:35:38.586 --> 00:35:40.377
- I'm only putting it on instagram!
- Arjun, I was just joking!


674
00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:41.752
Watch it, I'll tweet it...

675
00:35:42.252 --> 00:35:43.211
Arjun, just leave it!

676
00:35:45.044 --> 00:35:46.127
Ninety years...

677
00:35:46.294 --> 00:35:49.336
Ninety... and is this
all Burma Teak wood?


678
00:35:49.461 --> 00:35:50.586
Yeah.

679
00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:52.919
- Hi.
- Hi!


680
00:35:55.377 --> 00:35:57.586
Listen... can I click some pictures?

681
00:35:57.752 --> 00:35:59.669
- Of course.
- Thank you.


682
00:36:00.044 --> 00:36:03.169
Wow, who's that!
I think I'm rushing into this marriage!


683
00:36:03.627 --> 00:36:05.169
So cute, dude!

684
00:36:05.544 --> 00:36:07.002
Hit on him!

685
00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:12.086
- May I have a look inside?
- Sure!


686
00:36:13.086 --> 00:36:14.377
Have you lost it?

687
00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:16.044
- He's so cute, man, I can't help it!
- Tia!


688
00:36:16.127 --> 00:36:17.169
Come with us, Tia...

689
00:36:17.252 --> 00:36:20.252
No, no... You guys go!
It's your pre-Honeymoon period...


690
00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:22.044
What'll I do there?

691
00:36:22.377 --> 00:36:25.502
Okay, but we've decided we're
coming back for your birthday.


692
00:36:25.586 --> 00:36:27.252
Not this birthday thing again.

693
00:36:27.377 --> 00:36:29.294
I honestly want to
spend alone time here.


694
00:36:29.419 --> 00:36:31.836
Plus, I have work - a presentation
to finish and... now I have to go in.


695
00:36:32.002 --> 00:36:33.669
- Yes, sir! Corning.
- Okay, go...


696
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:36.086
- You have a really nice house, Tia!
- Thank you.


697
00:36:36.377 --> 00:36:38.752
So I'll share the pictures
with my partners and...


698
00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:42.711
Meanwhile, if there's a family elder
I can talk to about business and such...


699
00:36:42.877 --> 00:36:44.127
Please give me the number?

700
00:36:44.877 --> 00:36:46.252
Umm... me.

701
00:36:47.877 --> 00:36:49.877
- Oh, sorry.
- No, that's fine.


702
00:36:50.252 --> 00:36:53.044
When I think of owners,
they're usually old men.


703
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:55.377
Stomach out, no hair, etc...

704
00:36:55.794 --> 00:37:00.127
Of course! But I look pretty much
the same without my wig and dentures.


705
00:37:02.419 --> 00:37:04.211
How did you find the place, son?

706
00:37:06.627 --> 00:37:08.502
- You're funny.
- You're hot.


707
00:37:12.419 --> 00:37:15.669
I'm really funny!
Sometimes. Funny girl...


708
00:37:15.794 --> 00:37:17.086
Yeah, it was a pleasure.

709
00:37:17.211 --> 00:37:18.752
- Keep in touch.
- You too.


710
00:37:18.919 --> 00:37:20.419
- Okay, bye...
- Bye!


711
00:37:24.711 --> 00:37:27.086
And this was taken in Hawaii.

712
00:37:28.252 --> 00:37:29.544
You know, son...

713
00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:35.294
I used to dream of going to Hawaii...
And roaming naked on the beach...


714
00:37:35.627 --> 00:37:38.544
One chica here and one...

715
00:37:39.377 --> 00:37:42.836
That dream should have
been fulfilled in your youth.


716
00:37:43.002 --> 00:37:48.086
Ignore her. Maybe we should
take you to France for your birthday.


717
00:37:48.169 --> 00:37:49.336
France has the nude beaches.

718
00:37:49.419 --> 00:37:53.211
Take me anywhere...
All I have to do is shave my chest.


719
00:37:53.586 --> 00:37:57.211
I mean, if you want to get
six pack abs, that'll be good too...


720
00:37:57.377 --> 00:37:58.752
Leave this.

721
00:37:59.044 --> 00:38:02.377
Tell me... Can you watch
anything you want on this... iPanda?


722
00:38:02.544 --> 00:38:03.544
Yeah...

723
00:38:03.877 --> 00:38:05.627
- Films, too?
- Yes...


724
00:38:06.794 --> 00:38:08.377
Like... exciting films?

725
00:38:09.586 --> 00:38:11.002
Exciting?

726
00:38:11.711 --> 00:38:14.919
What do they call it... blue films?!

727
00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:17.627
You can...

728
00:38:18.544 --> 00:38:20.752
- How exciting!
- There are cartoon versions now!


729
00:38:20.836 --> 00:38:22.294
- Ohhh!
- Yeah!


730
00:38:22.419 --> 00:38:24.586
It's so easy for your generation.

731
00:38:24.752 --> 00:38:25.752
How so?

732
00:38:25.919 --> 00:38:31.586
I lied to your Grandma and watched
Ram Teri Ganga Maili 14 times!


733
00:38:31.752 --> 00:38:32.544
14!

734
00:38:32.627 --> 00:38:34.002
Just for one scene...

735
00:38:34.127 --> 00:38:37.086
When Mandakini comes in that wet sari...

736
00:38:37.919 --> 00:38:40.711
After that waterfall...

737
00:38:41.169 --> 00:38:43.711
I would dream of standing behind her...

738
00:38:43.794 --> 00:38:46.086
She would embrace me-

739
00:38:46.627 --> 00:38:50.669
I think the bananas are rotten, buddy...

740
00:38:53.252 --> 00:38:55.419
That's what they
call a change of topic!


741
00:38:55.836 --> 00:38:57.294
My arms call out to you...

742
00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:59.419
- I have a lotto learn from you.
Check this out!


743
00:38:59.627 --> 00:39:00.794
Oi!!!

744
00:39:01.461 --> 00:39:03.419
It's her!

745
00:39:06.044 --> 00:39:09.461
Stop me before I
climb into this iPanda!


746
00:39:13.127 --> 00:39:16.461
Arjun... I have an idea.

747
00:39:18.252 --> 00:39:22.002
Are you sure Dadu won't like a
foxy 10x10 photo of your Grandma more?


748
00:39:22.169 --> 00:39:23.836
You know Dadu...

749
00:39:24.336 --> 00:39:26.419
No, dude... your Grandma was quite sexy.

750
00:39:27.044 --> 00:39:29.461
- Not my Grandmom!
- This could break!


751
00:39:29.877 --> 00:39:31.252
Come here for a second!

752
00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:32.419
Bring this inside!

753
00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:34.086
What man...

754
00:39:34.169 --> 00:39:35.377
Look it's ready... Karim!

755
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:39.336
- Stop staring at Aunty
and bring her in!


756
00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.544
- Uncle! White and red small-
- Boo!


757
00:39:50.627 --> 00:39:52.961
Oh my God! Arjun! Hi!

758
00:39:53.419 --> 00:39:54.627
- How are you?
- Good!


759
00:39:54.711 --> 00:39:55.544
Not available.

760
00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:57.836
- Where can I get it?
- No idea, ma'am.


761
00:39:57.919 --> 00:39:58.794
What are you looking for?

762
00:39:58.877 --> 00:40:01.711
You know... We used to eat
those sweet cigarettes as kids?


763
00:40:01.877 --> 00:40:02.502
Oh ya ya...

764
00:40:02.586 --> 00:40:04.627
I can't find them
anywhere and I love them!


765
00:40:04.836 --> 00:40:05.877
- Ah!
- Yeah...


766
00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:07.752
What are you doing here?

767
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:11.127
I was actually in Wasim's studio...

768
00:40:11.294 --> 00:40:12.419
Want to see?

769
00:40:12.961 --> 00:40:13.836
Okay... what?

770
00:40:13.919 --> 00:40:14.961
- Come I'll show... come!
- Okay!


771
00:40:15.044 --> 00:40:16.961
- Aye! Okay, please pack this!
- Come!


772
00:40:27.086 --> 00:40:28.877
Don't judge,
it's for Dadu's birthday!


773
00:40:29.044 --> 00:40:31.627
Boobly! I know this bodybuilding
competition is important...


774
00:40:31.711 --> 00:40:32.627
I'll get people!

775
00:40:34.419 --> 00:40:35.336
<i>-</i> Hi!
<i>-</i> Hi!


776
00:40:35.419 --> 00:40:36.211
What's up?

777
00:40:36.294 --> 00:40:37.919
Tia... I'm good! How are you?

778
00:40:38.086 --> 00:40:39.752
Stop enjoying this
and take madam inside.


779
00:40:39.877 --> 00:40:41.044
Don't touch her there...

780
00:40:41.127 --> 00:40:43.044
Boobly's called you
for the bodybuilding thing.


781
00:40:43.169 --> 00:40:44.252
Come man, please... it'll be fun.

782
00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:45.461
I have no interest in naked men.

783
00:40:45.544 --> 00:40:49.419
Try and understand, man... Boobly
doesn't have my brains or looks!


784
00:40:49.461 --> 00:40:50.919
- He only knows bodybuilding!
- Let it go, man...


785
00:40:51.002 --> 00:40:52.627
He needs the encouragement...
It'll be fun!


786
00:40:52.836 --> 00:40:53.794
I'll come!

787
00:40:53.919 --> 00:40:55.169
You? Really?

788
00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:56.002
Ya!

789
00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:57.544
- That's nice.
- I'm nice.


790
00:40:57.627 --> 00:40:59.044
Ya... she's nice.

791
00:40:59.294 --> 00:41:02.419
Okay, I guess I'll come too...
Day after, right?


792
00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:04.211
Look at this turncoat.

793
00:41:04.419 --> 00:41:06.211
Team player, bro!
Boobly's like my brother!


794
00:41:06.294 --> 00:41:07.669
Oh, is that right?!

795
00:41:09.044 --> 00:41:10.961
- Day after?
- Day after.


796
00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:28.419
Listen, this is the catering area.
We need 10 tables set up there.


797
00:41:28.502 --> 00:41:29.294
Okay-

798
00:41:29.377 --> 00:41:31.252
- Mehfooz! Up there!
- DJ?


799
00:41:31.336 --> 00:41:32.836
The DJ's ready.
Ready, ready...


800
00:41:32.919 --> 00:41:34.252
- I'm going now.
- Confetti!


801
00:41:34.336 --> 00:41:35.294
Morn!

802
00:41:35.377 --> 00:41:37.752
- Where's the phone diary kept?
- It's right there! Here!


803
00:41:37.836 --> 00:41:38.669
Oh, okay.

804
00:41:39.919 --> 00:41:42.794
I finally spoke to Shashi Uncle... He
said he'll be here as soon as he can.


805
00:41:42.877 --> 00:41:43.669
Okay, thank goodness.

806
00:41:43.752 --> 00:41:46.711
And also why don't you
call some of your hot friends.


807
00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:50.627
Oh and listen...
Don't tell Shashi Uncle anything.


808
00:41:50.794 --> 00:41:51.627
About what?

809
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:53.752
All that drama with your Dad...

810
00:41:53.836 --> 00:41:57.294
Hello? This is Rahul calling on behalf
of Mr. Ramesh Chand...


811
00:41:57.377 --> 00:41:58.669
May I speak to Mr. Chaudhry?

812
00:41:59.627 --> 00:42:00.836
What?!

813
00:42:02.877 --> 00:42:04.086
I'm sorry to hear that.

814
00:42:04.586 --> 00:42:05.502
- Bro...

815
00:42:05.919 --> 00:42:08.252
Looks like at this rate only you,
me and Wasim will be at this party.


816
00:42:08.919 --> 00:42:10.711
Ask Dad to call his friends!

817
00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:12.544
Ask your Dad to call his friends!

818
00:42:14.002 --> 00:42:15.169
What's cooking?

819
00:42:15.377 --> 00:42:17.502
Smells really nice!

820
00:42:21.836 --> 00:42:24.961
Morn, I never talk to Shashi
Uncle about such things.


821
00:42:25.627 --> 00:42:29.044
I'm not choosing sides
or saying who's right...


822
00:42:29.377 --> 00:42:31.752
But lately, you're always
picking fights with Dad.


823
00:42:32.419 --> 00:42:33.502
I'm picking fights?!

824
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:36.461
I'm just telling it as I see it.

825
00:42:36.877 --> 00:42:39.877
You know what my 35th
anniversary gift was?


826
00:42:41.169 --> 00:42:42.252
A Mixer
-Grinder...

827
00:42:42.752 --> 00:42:43.919
- From Harsh.

828
00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:47.586
There's no difference between
Dharmendra and me, these days.


829
00:42:47.752 --> 00:42:49.877
- What?!
- It's not like I can be Anu!


830
00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:53.711
Ever since she opened her boutique,
all I hear is -


831
00:42:54.044 --> 00:42:56.752
"Anu's taste", "Anu's business sense"...

832
00:42:56.836 --> 00:42:59.752
Morn, not this Anu spiel again...
Who cares about Anu's taste?!


833
00:42:59.836 --> 00:43:01.836
Can't we all talk about
this like mature adults?!


834
00:43:04.044 --> 00:43:05.502
Maybe not all of us...

835
00:43:06.836 --> 00:43:09.752
Morn, come to London
with me for a few days?


836
00:43:09.877 --> 00:43:10.752
With you?

837
00:43:11.169 --> 00:43:12.336
What would I do there?

838
00:43:12.419 --> 00:43:13.586
We'll party, obviously!

839
00:43:14.919 --> 00:43:17.836
No, no... You're always so busy...

840
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:19.461
Morn I've lived there for 8 years...

841
00:43:19.544 --> 00:43:22.544
If you don't come,
how will you see how I live...


842
00:43:22.752 --> 00:43:25.752
where I live...and more importantly
with whom I live?


843
00:43:25.961 --> 00:43:27.419
Ah! Point!

844
00:43:27.627 --> 00:43:33.669
But you forget... as your mother,
I know you better than anyone else.


845
00:43:34.461 --> 00:43:37.961
Okay, if you want
to do something for me...


846
00:43:38.294 --> 00:43:43.627
Forget this Nicky person
and get me a nice Indian bride.


847
00:43:44.002 --> 00:43:46.961
- Grandchildren playing on my lap...
- End of conversation!


848
00:43:47.127 --> 00:43:49.794
Look who it is!

849
00:43:50.252 --> 00:43:52.461
I'm ready to have
Rahul's perfect children!


850
00:43:53.044 --> 00:43:54.752
Idiots.

851
00:43:54.961 --> 00:43:56.294
Oh, Rahul... She's perfect!

852
00:43:57.502 --> 00:44:00.127
Look what you've done, Rahul!

853
00:44:01.419 --> 00:44:02.336
Bye!

854
00:44:04.419 --> 00:44:06.002
- I'm here 'til the 12th!

855
00:44:07.419 --> 00:44:10.752
I've called for the documents... They
should be here in a couple of days.


856
00:44:11.919 --> 00:44:14.211
Here we are at the main porch.

857
00:44:15.169 --> 00:44:17.419
Say hello to our helpful broker,
Mr. Makhija.


858
00:44:18.044 --> 00:44:21.419
It's not African, it's an Indian name!

859
00:44:21.711 --> 00:44:26.252
And this, Nick, is the beautiful
owner of this house... Tia.


860
00:44:26.336 --> 00:44:27.377
Say hi.

861
00:44:27.419 --> 00:44:29.669
Hi! Who am I talking to?

862
00:44:29.752 --> 00:44:30.669
Be nice.

863
00:44:31.336 --> 00:44:35.252
I'm heading to the garden
to show you the wonderful sunset.


864
00:44:35.502 --> 00:44:37.586
I really can't believe
this place was shut for <i>2</i> years.


865
00:44:38.294 --> 00:44:40.294
If I was you,
I'd come once every <i>2</i> months.


866
00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:42.044
It's only a 2 hour flight from Mumbai!

867
00:44:42.252 --> 00:44:45.336
Yeah... but I'm scared of flying.

868
00:44:45.794 --> 00:44:49.377
So? Everyone's afraid of something...

869
00:44:49.669 --> 00:44:51.086
What are you afraid of?

870
00:44:51.294 --> 00:44:52.419
I'm not telling you.

871
00:44:52.669 --> 00:44:54.961
Why?! Come on...

872
00:44:55.461 --> 00:44:57.294
- It's embarrassing.
- Come on, Rahul...


873
00:44:57.419 --> 00:44:58.586
- Rats...
- What?!


874
00:44:58.669 --> 00:44:59.461
Rats!

875
00:44:59.544 --> 00:45:00.544
Are you serious?!

876
00:45:00.627 --> 00:45:01.461
I'm serious!

877
00:45:02.377 --> 00:45:03.627
Very manly!

878
00:45:04.044 --> 00:45:06.711
There's a Nepalese
film playing at Liberty...


879
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:09.669
Sorry, Kishore,
I don't know Nepalese...


880
00:45:09.752 --> 00:45:11.544
Tia he isn't asking you out...
I think he's asking for himself.


881
00:45:11.627 --> 00:45:15.836
I know! My sense of humour...
Please go!


882
00:45:16.002 --> 00:45:18.336
- Your dinner?
- I'll eat out.


883
00:45:18.669 --> 00:45:20.252
Bye, Kishore...

884
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:21.544
I love you, Kishore!

885
00:45:21.627 --> 00:45:24.377
Does he always look so scared?
- Always!


886
00:45:25.002 --> 00:45:27.669
Are there any good
restaurants around here?


887
00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:32.002
Maybe Shinchow's?!

888
00:45:41.502 --> 00:45:42.794
Kishore always looks depressed!

889
00:45:42.877 --> 00:45:44.836
He's actually really happy!

890
00:45:45.127 --> 00:45:46.211
By <i>the way...</i>

891
00:45:46.419 --> 00:45:48.419
You're right!
This place is shady as hell!


892
00:45:48.502 --> 00:45:49.794
Warned you...

893
00:45:51.044 --> 00:45:52.169
So spicy!

894
00:45:53.919 --> 00:45:55.586
Something's stuck in your teeth...

895
00:45:57.169 --> 00:45:58.211
Sorry...

896
00:45:58.419 --> 00:45:59.794
More beer?

897
00:46:00.169 --> 00:46:01.794
2 more beers, please!

898
00:46:02.586 --> 00:46:03.627
Oh!

899
00:46:04.419 --> 00:46:06.752
There's something
coming out of your nose...


900
00:46:07.127 --> 00:46:08.044
Sorry...

901
00:46:10.836 --> 00:46:12.002
Now?

902
00:46:16.002 --> 00:46:17.377
<i>I</i> got you!

903
00:46:17.836 --> 00:46:20.461
Okay... what's more embarrassing...

904
00:46:20.752 --> 00:46:24.127
Chicken stuck in your teeth
or a booger coming out of your nose?


905
00:46:24.419 --> 00:46:25.961
A booger stuck in my teeth!

906
00:46:26.211 --> 00:46:27.044
What?!

907
00:46:27.211 --> 00:46:28.377
Can that even happen?!

908
00:46:28.419 --> 00:46:29.877
Didn't you do this as a kid?

909
00:46:30.836 --> 00:46:32.336
Yuck! Rahul!

910
00:46:32.419 --> 00:46:34.544
- I used to love it, man!

911
00:46:34.794 --> 00:46:35.877
That's sick!

912
00:46:35.961 --> 00:46:36.836
Thank you!

913
00:46:42.419 --> 00:46:43.961
No way Tia...
There's a limit to being crazy...


914
00:46:44.044 --> 00:46:44.877
There is no such limit!

915
00:46:44.961 --> 00:46:46.544
There is! You can't do it, anyway...

916
00:46:46.627 --> 00:46:49.544
If I do this,
we are going to the dance floor.


917
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:51.377
- Done.
- Okay.


918
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:07.502
Shit! Sorry!

919
00:47:08.794 --> 00:47:09.836
Sir!

920
00:47:10.252 --> 00:47:13.377
It was a mosquito! 
You'll get dengue!

921
00:47:13.502 --> 00:47:14.919
What mosquito?

922
00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:17.419
I also got bitten...

923
00:47:17.836 --> 00:47:19.044
Sir!

924
00:47:30.044 --> 00:47:31.002
Show me your moves!

925
00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:32.294
What moves?

926
00:47:33.002 --> 00:47:34.377
Everyone's got moves!

927
00:47:34.544 --> 00:47:35.419
Such as?

928
00:47:35.794 --> 00:47:37.002
Such as...

929
00:47:37.169 --> 00:47:39.169
The Shampoo Ad move!

930
00:47:39.252 --> 00:47:40.169
Okay-

931
00:47:42.919 --> 00:47:44.211
Come on!

932
00:47:49.002 --> 00:47:49.919
Your turn.

933
00:47:50.002 --> 00:47:52.294
Okay... The Milkshake!

934
00:47:53.794 --> 00:47:54.586
Okay...

935
00:47:57.919 --> 00:48:00.294
Oh God! Superb!

936
00:48:00.669 --> 00:48:01.919
This is my favourite!

937
00:48:02.294 --> 00:48:03.961
Grinding spices move!

938
00:48:04.044 --> 00:48:05.336
Alright! Okay.

939
00:48:06.502 --> 00:48:08.752
Grinding spices!

940
00:48:11.961 --> 00:48:13.211
The Iron move!

941
00:48:17.211 --> 00:48:18.086
Pigeon!

942
00:48:23.169 --> 00:48:24.502
Electrocution!

943
00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:35.169
Okay... bye...

944
00:48:35.377 --> 00:48:36.294
Bye...

945
00:48:36.586 --> 00:48:37.877
See you.

946
00:48:38.419 --> 00:48:39.836
- Let's go.
- Oh shit...


947
00:48:39.919 --> 00:48:40.752
What's wrong?

948
00:48:40.836 --> 00:48:43.794
- Kishore!
The fuse is out again!


949
00:48:44.169 --> 00:48:47.294
Tell me if there are any more issues
with this house... I'll call Makhija.


950
00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:49.294
- Rat!!!
- What the f-


951
00:48:54.919 --> 00:48:57.086
Are you nuts?!

952
00:48:59.252 --> 00:49:00.711
This might work...

953
00:49:06.211 --> 00:49:07.377
Or not.

954
00:49:08.836 --> 00:49:10.377
It's a little small, isn't it?

955
00:49:14.627 --> 00:49:15.752
What?

956
00:49:17.669 --> 00:49:19.044
What is it?

957
00:49:20.294 --> 00:49:22.169
- Dude...
- Tia, you're sick.


958
00:49:24.377 --> 00:49:25.336
What are you saying?

959
00:49:25.419 --> 00:49:28.419
You're leaving?! 
My fuse... oh.

960
00:49:29.294 --> 00:49:32.377
Sorry!
It was a joke!


961
00:49:32.877 --> 00:49:35.002
Kishore, man!!!

962
00:49:37.961 --> 00:49:40.169
Bang it right in the centre...

963
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:43.544
You hold this.

964
00:49:44.127 --> 00:49:45.836
I'll lift you up.

965
00:49:46.086 --> 00:49:47.461
Are you sure?

966
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:50.419
Okay, one second... One second!

967
00:49:50.627 --> 00:49:51.794
Okay, ready.

968
00:49:53.211 --> 00:49:54.252
Okay, ready.

969
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:57.836
You're really heavy, man!

970
00:49:57.919 --> 00:49:59.919
- Shut up! I have heavy bones!

971
00:50:00.002 --> 00:50:01.169
- Oh God!

972
00:50:01.586 --> 00:50:02.669
- Oh God!

973
00:50:04.836 --> 00:50:06.002
Sorry...

974
00:50:06.502 --> 00:50:08.877
Let me see?

975
00:50:09.419 --> 00:50:11.211
I think it's a scratch or-

976
00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:14.794
A little bit here...

977
00:50:16.044 --> 00:50:17.294
Right there...

978
00:50:17.544 --> 00:50:18.669
Is it hurting?

979
00:50:22.836 --> 00:50:24.127
- Ma'am?!

980
00:50:24.461 --> 00:50:25.752
Kishore!

981
00:50:26.419 --> 00:50:27.294
Where are you?

982
00:50:27.377 --> 00:50:29.002
Kishore, where were you?!

983
00:50:29.086 --> 00:50:31.377
I was watching the movie!

984
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.086
Why didn't you fix this?

985
00:50:33.252 --> 00:50:36.419
That's for the pump room!
The fuse is here.


986
00:50:37.377 --> 00:50:40.127
Why is it there? 
You didn't fix it...

987
00:50:41.336 --> 00:50:42.711
Thank God...

988
00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.711
I'll leave... It's late.

989
00:50:48.836 --> 00:50:49.627
- Yeah...

990
00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:52.169
<i>-</i> Okay...
<i>-</i> Okay!


991
00:50:52.752 --> 00:50:54.002
- Bye...
- Bye.


992
00:51:00.044 --> 00:51:01.169
Bunkoo...

993
00:51:02.669 --> 00:51:04.002
I'm so-

994
00:51:04.419 --> 00:51:06.419
Please go, Kishore. Thank you.

995
00:51:07.794 --> 00:51:10.544
Shit, Bunkoo... 
Shit shit shit...

996
00:51:10.752 --> 00:51:12.294
I'm so stupid!

997
00:51:12.419 --> 00:51:14.544
Shit, I'm so stupid!

998
00:51:16.586 --> 00:51:18.419
This is all your fault!

999
00:51:19.586 --> 00:51:20.752
Hey...

1000
00:51:21.461 --> 00:51:23.377
...you think he won't
want my house now?


1001
00:51:23.627 --> 00:51:26.461
- Listen, let's discuss
this over Skype on Thursday...


1002
00:51:26.919 --> 00:51:29.461
I can't right now!
I've got too much on my plate!


1003
00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.586
I'm at the hospital,
I'll call you later.


1004
00:51:32.294 --> 00:51:33.127
Bye.

1005
00:51:33.502 --> 00:51:35.002
What's wrong? Problem?

1006
00:51:36.336 --> 00:51:38.336
I'm never gonna finish this damn book!

1007
00:51:40.752 --> 00:51:42.086
Harsh isn't here?

1008
00:51:42.794 --> 00:51:43.669
No, Why?

1009
00:51:44.669 --> 00:51:46.836
He said he'd come with you...

1010
00:51:48.669 --> 00:51:49.961
Now he's using you as an excuse.

1011
00:51:50.044 --> 00:51:50.919
Morn!

1012
00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:53.836
Don't be so suspicious all the time...

1013
00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.127
I'm going to Dadu.

1014
00:51:57.419 --> 00:51:58.669
Woah...

1015
00:52:00.461 --> 00:52:02.794
How can they be so huge?!

1016
00:52:03.044 --> 00:52:05.211
You have no idea how
big they can be, Dadu!


1017
00:52:05.419 --> 00:52:08.044
I love this so much...

1018
00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:09.919
It stopped!

1019
00:52:10.169 --> 00:52:12.419
You need a credit card to watch more...

1020
00:52:12.711 --> 00:52:13.794
Give me yours!

1021
00:52:13.877 --> 00:52:15.419
Mine... actually...

1022
00:52:16.086 --> 00:52:19.377
Rahul! You have a credit card, right?

1023
00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:20.627
Ya, Why?

1024
00:52:20.919 --> 00:52:25.377
I... I... want to download
some hymns!


1025
00:52:25.919 --> 00:52:27.752
- Yeah, Wasim!
- Turning to religion, Dadu?


1026
00:52:27.961 --> 00:52:30.669
Ever since my heart attack
it's the only thing that keeps happy.


1027
00:52:30.752 --> 00:52:32.211
<i>-</i> Really?
<i>-</i> Yes!


1028
00:52:32.586 --> 00:52:34.252
Dadu, I'm off.

1029
00:52:34.461 --> 00:52:35.336
What's your hurry?

1030
00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:39.002
I'm going to see Boobly's big ones...
It's free... Wanna come?


1031
00:52:39.086 --> 00:52:40.586
No, no, I have my hymns.

1032
00:52:40.711 --> 00:52:42.502
- Okay, bye...
- Bye!


1033
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:44.794
Oi! spiritual card.

1034
00:52:49.586 --> 00:52:51.461
He's so sexy.

1035
00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:55.419
Boobly! This girl thinks you're sexy!

1036
00:52:55.752 --> 00:52:57.086
Thanks for coming.

1037
00:53:00.169 --> 00:53:01.127
Very welcome.

1038
00:53:07.169 --> 00:53:08.586
This is mad!

1039
00:53:09.752 --> 00:53:12.419
How can I be enjoying this?!
What's wrong with me!


1040
00:53:14.544 --> 00:53:18.252
Look at Mr. Red Briefs...
Such a long nose!


1041
00:53:18.336 --> 00:53:20.586
I can't believe THAT'S
what you noticed!


1042
00:53:20.711 --> 00:53:21.627
I mean...

1043
00:53:22.419 --> 00:53:23.752
You know what they say...

1044
00:53:23.836 --> 00:53:25.586
A long nose means a long...

1045
00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:26.669
Ah...

1046
00:53:29.419 --> 00:53:31.502
Your nose is pretty tiny.

1047
00:53:34.502 --> 00:53:36.794
It's Boobly!

1048
00:53:42.294 --> 00:53:43.669
Oh my God!

1049
00:53:55.086 --> 00:53:57.086
This was my favourite pose!

1050
00:53:57.336 --> 00:54:02.086
Oh, wow... butt in, chest out!
Wow! Too hot!


1051
00:54:02.919 --> 00:54:06.544
One second... God, why is
my brother always calling me!


1052
00:54:07.669 --> 00:54:08.586
Hello?

1053
00:54:08.669 --> 00:54:09.711
Yeah...

1054
00:54:10.544 --> 00:54:13.127
Yes, I'll take morn tomorrow morning...

1055
00:54:13.586 --> 00:54:15.794
Ya, don't worry... 
I'll be there.

1056
00:54:16.502 --> 00:54:19.294
See you in a bit. 
I'll call you... bye.

1057
00:54:21.586 --> 00:54:23.544
So Beavis and Butthead patched up!

1058
00:54:24.044 --> 00:54:26.961
Yeah... Beavis and Butthead
patched up for now.


1059
00:54:27.669 --> 00:54:30.502
- Have you got siblings?
- Nope. One and only!


1060
00:54:30.711 --> 00:54:33.169
Wow! You're so lucky...

1061
00:54:33.502 --> 00:54:35.294
You must've been such a pampered kid.

1062
00:54:35.419 --> 00:54:38.044
I mean, my sweetie pie, my princess...

1063
00:54:38.252 --> 00:54:39.586
That never happened to me.

1064
00:54:41.169 --> 00:54:44.044
You want to be called
'princess' and 'sweetie pie'?


1065
00:54:44.127 --> 00:54:47.544
No, man... I didn't get
much attention growing up...


1066
00:54:48.502 --> 00:54:51.919
My parents died when I was 13.
So I know what you mean.


1067
00:54:52.002 --> 00:54:54.294
Oh... I'm sorry... 
I didn't mean-

1068
00:54:54.461 --> 00:54:56.461
No, it's okay!
It's not like you knew...


1069
00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:58.502
It's okay.

1070
00:55:01.461 --> 00:55:02.586
I have an offer for you.

1071
00:55:02.877 --> 00:55:04.752
Take my family and
give me your bungalow?


1072
00:55:04.877 --> 00:55:07.627
Oh, really! I'll think about it...

1073
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:10.252
- Princess!
- Oh ya, of course!


1074
00:55:15.169 --> 00:55:16.627
- Here you go.

1075
00:55:16.836 --> 00:55:19.127
- Some music?
- Ya! Nice pictures...


1076
00:55:19.294 --> 00:55:20.419
Thank you...

1077
00:55:23.752 --> 00:55:25.502
- Listen I don't mean
to be inappropriate...


1078
00:55:25.586 --> 00:55:27.044
- but isn't this too big for you?

1079
00:55:27.127 --> 00:55:29.336
- Arjun!
- What is this, 48 G?!


1080
00:55:29.419 --> 00:55:31.711
Pervert! It's Bunkoo's!

1081
00:55:31.794 --> 00:55:34.502
- Let's meet Bunkoo again, man.
- You're sick! You know that, right?


1082
00:55:34.752 --> 00:55:36.169
- Sick!
- Jealous?


1083
00:55:36.669 --> 00:55:40.169
Of course... that's why
I sent her far, far away.


1084
00:55:40.752 --> 00:55:43.627
Man... someone sedate my brother.

1085
00:55:44.252 --> 00:55:47.627
- Why do you fight with him so much?
- Why do you ask so many questions?


1086
00:55:47.669 --> 00:55:49.461
That's how you make friends!

1087
00:55:51.169 --> 00:55:53.044
- And you don't give up, huh?
- No!


1088
00:55:53.377 --> 00:55:54.711
I don't give up.

1089
00:55:55.836 --> 00:55:57.711
Come on, you can tell me.

1090
00:56:03.794 --> 00:56:08.294
So... 5 years ago,
I was writing my first novel.


1091
00:56:08.752 --> 00:56:13.252
My brother's first book had failed...
and he was struggling with his second.


1092
00:56:15.252 --> 00:56:18.502
When his second book was published,
a year later...


1093
00:56:18.877 --> 00:56:22.211
it was a bestseller... did really well...

1094
00:56:25.211 --> 00:56:31.419
The only problem was that...
his idea was exactly like mine...


1095
00:56:34.002 --> 00:56:34.961
No...

1096
00:56:35.044 --> 00:56:37.669
Of course the writing style
was different... different ending...


1097
00:56:37.752 --> 00:56:42.252
But... subplots,
characters... very similar.


1098
00:56:45.377 --> 00:56:47.044
Didn't you ever confront him about it?

1099
00:56:48.252 --> 00:56:51.919
No... everyone would have said
I'm jealous of his success, as always.


1100
00:56:52.169 --> 00:56:57.002
Besides... Morn said this
could destroy our family... so...


1101
00:56:58.669 --> 00:56:59.794
Maybe...

1102
00:57:02.877 --> 00:57:06.502
Just think... if my name
had been on that book...


1103
00:57:07.794 --> 00:57:10.169
...today publishers
would be chasing me...


1104
00:57:10.252 --> 00:57:13.711
And my parents wouldn't
think I'm such a big loser.


1105
00:57:18.669 --> 00:57:23.627
I have something to cheer you up.

1106
00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:26.794
First close your eyes... come on.

1107
00:57:28.127 --> 00:57:31.586
- What are your intentions?
- Just wait.


1108
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:36.252
Hold on...

1109
00:57:36.836 --> 00:57:38.377
Okay...

1110
00:57:40.377 --> 00:57:42.752
Actually you're right...
I do feel better!


1111
00:57:43.127 --> 00:57:45.294
- See!
- Thanks! I'll take it home.


1112
00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:46.836
Give it back!

1113
00:57:47.169 --> 00:57:48.919
It's not your size.

1114
00:57:49.794 --> 00:57:51.752
Free tomorrow evening?

1115
00:57:52.711 --> 00:57:53.919
Why?

1116
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:57.919
Arjun Kapoor's suitcase.

1117
00:58:00.002 --> 00:58:01.419
The lock's broken!

1118
00:58:01.669 --> 00:58:03.711
Morn! Where's Arjun?

1119
00:58:03.877 --> 00:58:05.877
- He went to pick up Wasim!

1120
00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.169
You can talk to the airline
if there's a problem...


1121
00:58:12.877 --> 00:58:14.461
- Hello...

1122
00:58:14.586 --> 00:58:16.211
Nice to see you...

1123
00:58:16.419 --> 00:58:18.461
Welcome!
- We are the first ones!


1124
00:58:18.711 --> 00:58:21.086
- Smile!
- Cheese!


1125
00:58:23.294 --> 00:58:26.586
- Thank you!
- Thank you, uncle... take care!


1126
00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.627
- Who's an uncle?!
- Thank you...


1127
00:58:28.794 --> 00:58:30.919
Who taught you all this?!
The ward boy?


1128
00:58:31.002 --> 00:58:34.669
No one! I invented the selfie myself!

1129
00:58:34.877 --> 00:58:35.919
You and your stories...

1130
00:58:36.002 --> 00:58:37.544
What stories?!

1131
00:58:43.877 --> 00:58:45.461
Wow, she's hot!

1132
00:58:45.586 --> 00:58:47.752
She was my flatmate last year.

1133
00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:50.169
- You live with a chick?
- Ya!


1134
00:58:50.377 --> 00:58:52.252
I live with Boobly.

1135
00:58:52.544 --> 00:58:54.919
Can I borrow Rahul for a minute?

1136
00:58:55.044 --> 00:58:56.877
- Come with me...
- Excuse me.


1137
00:58:57.336 --> 00:58:59.169
- There's someone I want you to meet...
- Who?


1138
00:58:59.252 --> 00:59:00.294
Just come!

1139
00:59:00.377 --> 00:59:01.461
- Morn.

1140
00:59:02.294 --> 00:59:03.711
- I'll hang myself if...
- Preet!


1141
00:59:03.794 --> 00:59:06.919
Hi! I want you
to meet my son, Rahul.

1142
00:59:07.002 --> 00:59:07.794
Hi...

1143
00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.794
Preet's family owns
the King's Craig estate now.


1144
00:59:10.961 --> 00:59:12.252
<i>-</i> Really!
<i>-</i> Yes!


1145
00:59:12.336 --> 00:59:13.461
Hi, Preet... I'm Rahul.

1146
00:59:13.544 --> 00:59:15.211
Look at those kids!
Excuse me.


1147
00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.211
What the hell are you doing?!

1148
00:59:18.377 --> 00:59:19.961
I like your shoes!

1149
00:59:20.419 --> 00:59:22.211
Orange is my favourite colour!

1150
00:59:22.461 --> 00:59:23.586
Is it?!

1151
00:59:24.086 --> 00:59:26.086
- They're actually tangerine.
- Oh.


1152
00:59:26.961 --> 00:59:28.044
Nice...

1153
00:59:29.002 --> 00:59:31.169
So... what do you do?

1154
00:59:31.252 --> 00:59:33.586
I work for a tea company.

1155
00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:34.586
Boobly!

1156
00:59:34.669 --> 00:59:36.336
- Hi, what's up?
- How are you?


1157
00:59:36.502 --> 00:59:37.794
Thanks for coming.

1158
00:59:40.336 --> 00:59:41.169
You're welcome!

1159
00:59:41.252 --> 00:59:42.336
- Hey!

1160
00:59:42.836 --> 00:59:44.002
Hi, Arjun!

1161
00:59:45.002 --> 00:59:46.044
Hey, hi!

1162
00:59:46.127 --> 00:59:48.169
- What's up?

1163
00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:50.711
We have organic green teas...

1164
00:59:50.794 --> 00:59:55.211
Black teas, white teas,
silver tips... and Oolong!


1165
00:59:55.294 --> 00:59:56.711
Have you tried it?

1166
00:59:57.002 --> 00:59:59.211
No, I'm an alcoholic...
so just alcohol for me.


1167
00:59:59.336 --> 01:00:00.252
I'm just kidding.

1168
01:00:00.336 --> 01:00:02.461
I'll go get myself a beer. Want one?

1169
01:00:02.544 --> 01:00:03.252
No...

1170
01:00:03.336 --> 01:00:04.336
- Be right back.
- Okay!


1171
01:00:04.419 --> 01:00:05.919
Wow! Thank you!

1172
01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.752
- Did you do all of this?
- Yes!


1173
01:00:08.002 --> 01:00:10.961
If not a writer,
then at least a balloon man.


1174
01:00:11.086 --> 01:00:12.502
- Shut up!
- Save me, man.


1175
01:00:12.586 --> 01:00:14.419
Mom's stuck me with some tea lady!

1176
01:00:14.502 --> 01:00:15.961
Woah, let me see!

1177
01:00:16.669 --> 01:00:17.461
Hi!

1178
01:00:17.544 --> 01:00:18.627
Hi...

1179
01:00:18.711 --> 01:00:19.794
What are you doing here?

1180
01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.461
I'm here for his Dadu's birthday!

1181
01:00:21.544 --> 01:00:22.669
How do you know her?

1182
01:00:22.794 --> 01:00:24.544
We're friends... Wait.

1183
01:00:24.794 --> 01:00:26.336
How do you know each other?

1184
01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:30.086
I'm thinking of leasing her house
for the Artist Retreat.


1185
01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:31.211
My house!

1186
01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:32.252
Oh!

1187
01:00:33.461 --> 01:00:34.294
Okay-

1188
01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:36.127
I didn't know you'll were friends!

1189
01:00:36.336 --> 01:00:37.961
He's my older brother.

1190
01:00:38.211 --> 01:00:39.252
Butthead?!

1191
01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:40.919
- Rahul!

1192
01:00:41.544 --> 01:00:44.419
- Same thing.
- Yeah... no... never mind.


1193
01:00:44.711 --> 01:00:47.086
- Small world!
- Yeah, small world, after all...


1194
01:00:47.627 --> 01:00:48.627
Really...

1195
01:00:50.669 --> 01:00:52.627
- Will you have something?
- Of course!


1196
01:00:52.961 --> 01:00:54.169
I don't mind a drink...

1197
01:00:54.252 --> 01:00:55.586
- Beer?
- Ya... sure.


1198
01:00:55.669 --> 01:00:58.086
- What about you?
- No... thanks.


1199
01:01:03.211 --> 01:01:05.836
Listen, I'm really
sorry about the other day...


1200
01:01:05.961 --> 01:01:08.002
- It's okay...
- I'm really embarrassed.


1201
01:01:08.169 --> 01:01:09.336
Apology balloons?

1202
01:01:09.419 --> 01:01:11.627
Yes! For you! Please!

1203
01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:14.002
Thanks... It's okay,
I was pretty drunk, too.


1204
01:01:14.169 --> 01:01:17.586
Yeah! I think they put
something in those memos.


1205
01:01:17.669 --> 01:01:18.544
Food?

1206
01:01:18.627 --> 01:01:20.294
Nah, my stomach's off...

1207
01:01:22.544 --> 01:01:24.086
Something's burning...

1208
01:01:24.377 --> 01:01:25.877
Careful, Dharmendra!

1209
01:01:26.836 --> 01:01:28.211
It's your butt, buddy!

1210
01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:30.002
Hemorrhoids!

1211
01:01:30.377 --> 01:01:31.586
Dadu's here...

1212
01:01:32.586 --> 01:01:33.836
Uncle, Dadu's here.

1213
01:01:34.044 --> 01:01:35.252
Guys, Dadu's here.

1214
01:01:35.336 --> 01:01:38.044
- Is the gift ready?
- Yeah, I'll get it.


1215
01:01:38.836 --> 01:01:40.586
Guys! Dadu's here... come!

1216
01:01:40.669 --> 01:01:41.961
Wasim!

1217
01:04:05.002 --> 01:04:07.127
Hurry up, old man...

1218
01:04:08.669 --> 01:04:11.377
Dadu, this is my friend...Tia.

1219
01:04:11.461 --> 01:04:13.502
- Happy birthday, Dadu!
- Thank you...


1220
01:04:13.586 --> 01:04:16.627
I have a confession.. You're so cute,
I can't take my eyes off you.


1221
01:04:16.711 --> 01:04:18.336
Really...

1222
01:04:18.669 --> 01:04:20.377
She's hitting on me...

1223
01:04:21.294 --> 01:04:22.961
Girls today, I tell you...

1224
01:04:23.044 --> 01:04:25.419
Will you go on a
date to Hawaii with me?


1225
01:04:25.502 --> 01:04:26.711
Hawaii?! Of course!

1226
01:04:26.877 --> 01:04:28.919
Come on, play your turn!

1227
01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:31.627
Alright, fine...

1228
01:04:32.377 --> 01:04:33.544
Look!

1229
01:04:34.752 --> 01:04:37.461
Wow, Dadu! Great hand!

1230
01:04:38.377 --> 01:04:39.752
Sorry, we pack.

1231
01:04:40.336 --> 01:04:41.377
Pack!

1232
01:04:42.836 --> 01:04:43.919
Damnit

1233
01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:45.294
I'm so sorry!

1234
01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:46.877
So then, I win...

1235
01:04:47.044 --> 01:04:50.002
You come here! 
You're my lucky charm!

1236
01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:51.961
Dharmu! Get her a chair!

1237
01:04:52.044 --> 01:04:53.794
- Come sit!
- Okay...


1238
01:04:53.877 --> 01:04:56.044
Arjun, you come here.
You're my lucky charm!


1239
01:04:56.127 --> 01:04:58.961
Yes, Mr. Choksi... I'll
just go to the loo and come.


1240
01:04:59.044 --> 01:05:00.252
Okay!

1241
01:05:00.752 --> 01:05:01.836
Come on!

1242
01:05:02.002 --> 01:05:04.169
Arjun... Did you invite her?

1243
01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.127
Who her?

1244
01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:06.961
Anu Aunty, man!

1245
01:05:07.377 --> 01:05:08.961
He's always drunk!

1246
01:05:10.211 --> 01:05:11.461
I didn't invite her...

1247
01:05:11.544 --> 01:05:13.502
Lowest card wins!

1248
01:05:21.044 --> 01:05:22.877
Dad the party's screwed now!

1249
01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:26.419
I called all my old bank colleagues!

1250
01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:28.336
It would be strange to not call her!

1251
01:05:28.461 --> 01:05:30.461
And you know when Dadu was sick...

1252
01:05:30.586 --> 01:05:32.586
- Can you'll please taste this soup?

1253
01:05:32.919 --> 01:05:34.252
Is the salt okay?

1254
01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:37.961
- Something wrong?
- No, no... nothing.


1255
01:05:39.127 --> 01:05:40.377
Needs more salt...

1256
01:05:40.544 --> 01:05:42.044
Okay, why are you making such a face?!

1257
01:05:42.211 --> 01:05:44.169
I just have to use the loo...

1258
01:05:44.294 --> 01:05:45.294
So go!

1259
01:05:45.377 --> 01:05:46.877
Taste it, please?

1260
01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.627
- Hello! How are you?
- Hi, Anu Aunty!


1261
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:52.669
- Just needs a little salt, Morn...

1262
01:05:52.752 --> 01:05:53.669
Ummm... Hi!

1263
01:05:54.502 --> 01:05:56.169
Dadu's outside, let's go meet him?

1264
01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.211
I thought I'll meet you first.

1265
01:05:58.294 --> 01:05:59.419
Really...

1266
01:06:00.044 --> 01:06:01.711
- Hello!
- Hi, Anu Aunty...


1267
01:06:01.836 --> 01:06:04.586
- Hi, Harsh!
- Hi... Hi, Anu...


1268
01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.252
Here! Your favourite caramel cookies!

1269
01:06:07.336 --> 01:06:08.544
Oh ya! Thank you!

1270
01:06:08.627 --> 01:06:11.044
When you were a kid you
used to always come to me...


1271
01:06:11.127 --> 01:06:13.336
and ask me for "just one more"!

1272
01:06:13.544 --> 01:06:14.836
Really!

1273
01:06:15.836 --> 01:06:18.002
- I'm so happy to
see you after so long.


1274
01:06:18.169 --> 01:06:19.919
Look at you now! Handsome!

1275
01:06:19.961 --> 01:06:22.127
- Who invited her?

1276
01:06:22.377 --> 01:06:23.919
Dadu's right there...

1277
01:06:24.044 --> 01:06:25.336
- Hi, Sunita!

1278
01:06:25.711 --> 01:06:26.794
You look nice!

1279
01:06:26.877 --> 01:06:27.627
I need some ice...

1280
01:06:27.711 --> 01:06:29.836
- I'll get it!
- Get her out of my house.


1281
01:06:30.294 --> 01:06:32.294
- Please, Harsh!
- She's a guest...


1282
01:06:32.461 --> 01:06:34.127
- Guest, my bloody foot!
- Morn, please...


1283
01:06:34.211 --> 01:06:36.211
- Sunita...
- Anu, one sec.


1284
01:06:36.377 --> 01:06:39.794
I raise you 10!

1285
01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:42.711
Aye!

1286
01:06:42.794 --> 01:06:44.002
- This is cheating!

1287
01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:46.627
Like I would cheat on my birthday!

1288
01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:50.836
Please! You're so old now,
you're relying on a child for help!


1289
01:06:50.919 --> 01:06:52.627
One second!
Choksi uncle!


1290
01:06:52.711 --> 01:06:54.544
I'm taking my 30 bucks back.

1291
01:06:54.752 --> 01:06:57.211
Calm down, everybody!

1292
01:06:57.419 --> 01:06:58.961
One second, everybody!

1293
01:06:59.169 --> 01:07:01.961
- I'm really sorry...
- I don't want to upset anybody...


1294
01:07:02.169 --> 01:07:04.169
I'm sorry... I shouldn't have come.

1295
01:07:04.502 --> 01:07:06.086
I'm so sorry... Come with me.

1296
01:07:06.252 --> 01:07:07.336
Anu...

1297
01:07:08.794 --> 01:07:10.086
What's he saying sorry for?!

1298
01:07:10.252 --> 01:07:12.586
Are you done? Happy now?

1299
01:07:12.711 --> 01:07:13.919
Is this how we treat friends?!

1300
01:07:14.127 --> 01:07:15.836
Stuffing your face with
cake has made you so fat!


1301
01:07:16.002 --> 01:07:17.752
- How dare you call me fat!

1302
01:07:17.919 --> 01:07:20.169
I hope you fall in a ditch!

1303
01:07:20.377 --> 01:07:21.711
Come here, Boobly!

1304
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:24.877
Do something!

1305
01:07:25.086 --> 01:07:28.252
You come to my house
and call me a cheat!


1306
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:29.961
How many such friends do you have?

1307
01:07:30.127 --> 01:07:31.627
Just tell me all at once.

1308
01:07:31.752 --> 01:07:33.669
You're a lunatic.
You belong in an asylum.


1309
01:07:33.752 --> 01:07:35.127
- Dad...
- Good plan!


1310
01:07:35.211 --> 01:07:36.627
Just get me out of the way!

1311
01:07:36.711 --> 01:07:38.211
I'm going to break this goddamn thing!

1312
01:07:38.294 --> 01:07:39.794
<i>-</i> Dad!

1313
01:07:40.086 --> 01:07:41.794
I'll give you a slap!

1314
01:07:42.336 --> 01:07:44.669
Boobly, are you mad?!
Put Uncle down!


1315
01:07:45.044 --> 01:07:47.669
- Don't put him down!

1316
01:07:48.586 --> 01:07:50.211
- Dad!
- Ma, please!


1317
01:07:50.794 --> 01:07:53.127
- I'd like to see what you can do!
- Dad, calm down!


1318
01:07:54.752 --> 01:07:58.294
- Put him down!
- Is he nuts?!


1319
01:07:59.252 --> 01:08:00.919
Put him down, you bloody lunatic!

1320
01:08:01.127 --> 01:08:03.169
<i>'</i> Dad!

1321
01:08:03.336 --> 01:08:06.044
I'll break your limbs
if you do that again!


1322
01:08:06.127 --> 01:08:07.919
How dare he bring her here!

1323
01:08:08.169 --> 01:08:09.961
How dare Harsh do that!

1324
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:11.461
Yeah, Ma...

1325
01:08:11.544 --> 01:08:14.669
- He humiliated in front of the world!
- Morn, you're absolutely right...


1326
01:08:14.836 --> 01:08:17.169
I still have to go to the loo.
Just wait here <i>2</i> seconds...


1327
01:08:17.252 --> 01:08:19.294
Please don't move!

1328
01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:27.294
- Choksi Uncle, 
I apologise...

1329
01:08:27.461 --> 01:08:29.002
Uncle, wait...

1330
01:08:29.169 --> 01:08:31.336
Look here, donkey!

1331
01:08:32.461 --> 01:08:34.086
Cookies, it seems...

1332
01:08:34.336 --> 01:08:36.377
- Dadu...
- Fogie, look here!


1333
01:08:37.961 --> 01:08:39.086
- Dadu, stop!

1334
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:41.377
She forgot her goddamn cookies!

1335
01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.627
What a great party, huh?

1336
01:08:54.544 --> 01:08:56.086
Having fun?

1337
01:08:57.294 --> 01:09:00.211
It's over! Go home!

1338
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:04.752
I'm serious! Go home!

1339
01:09:22.044 --> 01:09:23.752
Where were you?

1340
01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:26.836
Do you have any sense at all?

1341
01:09:26.919 --> 01:09:29.002
Couldn't you sit
with mum for 5 minutes?


1342
01:10:03.294 --> 01:10:04.836
I don't know about Dadu...

1343
01:10:05.794 --> 01:10:07.544
but everyone
else sure was surprised.


1344
01:10:07.627 --> 01:10:08.419
Yeah!

1345
01:10:08.627 --> 01:10:10.752
Do you think Dad and Anu Aunty...?

1346
01:10:11.002 --> 01:10:12.294
No, man...

1347
01:10:12.961 --> 01:10:14.877
Dad's a lot of things but he's
not a cheater.


1348
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.752
Morn just overreacts...

1349
01:10:17.336 --> 01:10:18.461
Morn and overreaction?!

1350
01:10:18.586 --> 01:10:22.669
Shut up... How's your
novel coming along?


1351
01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:24.336
Have you got a publisher?

1352
01:10:24.419 --> 01:10:26.752
No, man... Same old crap...

1353
01:10:27.377 --> 01:10:28.252
What crap?

1354
01:10:28.377 --> 01:10:32.127
Everyone wants a happy ending...

1355
01:10:33.336 --> 01:10:34.377
And your story?

1356
01:10:34.877 --> 01:10:35.752
It's real.

1357
01:10:37.336 --> 01:10:40.127
And real life never
guarantees a happy ending...


1358
01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:44.669
Isn't that why we
look for it in stories?


1359
01:10:54.586 --> 01:10:58.002
Sometimes I wish
I had finished college...


1360
01:10:58.211 --> 01:11:00.586
Or completed the photography course...

1361
01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:05.044
Maybe I wouldn't be as successful as
you, but at least I'd have a back up.


1362
01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:08.086
Don't be so stressed...

1363
01:11:08.586 --> 01:11:10.711
Easy for you to say...

1364
01:11:11.002 --> 01:11:14.294
You're a successful novelist...
an entrepreneur...


1365
01:11:16.127 --> 01:11:20.586
...and what am I ? I'm just a part-time
bartender struggling to be a writer.


1366
01:11:20.919 --> 01:11:22.627
What's wrong with that?

1367
01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:25.794
Every struggler works
part-time... I've done it!


1368
01:11:26.252 --> 01:11:28.002
Yeah, but for how long?!

1369
01:11:30.752 --> 01:11:34.252
As a kid, I used to wonder
what you had that I didn't...


1370
01:11:35.419 --> 01:11:39.002
It took me all these years to
realise that this is who I am...


1371
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:41.586
I'm second best...

1372
01:11:42.919 --> 01:11:44.586
I'm just a runner up.

1373
01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:53.377
Listen...

1374
01:11:54.627 --> 01:11:56.211
if you're comfortable with it...

1375
01:11:56.419 --> 01:11:58.377
I can talk to an agent for you.

1376
01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:00.836
I could even read your
novel... give you feedback.


1377
01:12:01.169 --> 01:12:02.377
If you're okay with it.

1378
01:12:05.586 --> 01:12:07.461
I haven't carried a copy with me...

1379
01:12:08.794 --> 01:12:12.502
Well, okay... But if you
ever need help... just ask.


1380
01:12:13.461 --> 01:12:14.169
Ya!

1381
01:12:14.294 --> 01:12:16.169
Or else you could give it to Morn...

1382
01:12:16.544 --> 01:12:19.002
Her feedback is surprisingly great.

1383
01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.127
Really...

1384
01:12:23.461 --> 01:12:24.711
Tell me something...

1385
01:12:25.752 --> 01:12:27.502
What do you think of Tia?

1386
01:12:28.127 --> 01:12:29.169
Tia...

1387
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:33.419
Dude, she is so hot!
I'm going for it.


1388
01:12:34.461 --> 01:12:35.836
Really?

1389
01:12:37.711 --> 01:12:39.461
Look at your face!

1390
01:12:39.544 --> 01:12:42.502
I have no interest in her.
Relax. You make your move...


1391
01:12:42.919 --> 01:12:44.461
I'm very happy in my relationship.

1392
01:12:44.877 --> 01:12:46.502
Ah... video chat!

1393
01:12:47.211 --> 01:12:48.669
She's hot or what?

1394
01:12:49.711 --> 01:12:50.586
She's good.

1395
01:12:51.544 --> 01:12:53.336
Dude, but you can't even drive...

1396
01:12:53.419 --> 01:12:54.794
I can please her in other ways!

1397
01:12:54.877 --> 01:12:56.086
- Really!
- Want me to teach you?


1398
01:12:56.211 --> 01:12:57.419
Yeah, right.

1399
01:12:58.294 --> 01:12:59.794
Actually, today let me teach you.

1400
01:13:00.544 --> 01:13:01.502
Catch!

1401
01:13:02.752 --> 01:13:04.461
- Accelerate, man...

1402
01:13:04.711 --> 01:13:06.419
- The bloody music is distracting me!

1403
01:13:06.544 --> 01:13:08.211
- Careful, careful, careful!

1404
01:13:08.502 --> 01:13:09.544
- Sorry, bro!

1405
01:13:09.711 --> 01:13:11.169
You almost killed him!

1406
01:13:11.377 --> 01:13:12.544
You drive then, Schumacher!

1407
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:15.377
Shut this guy up, man!
Why is he honking at me!


1408
01:13:15.461 --> 01:13:16.627
Chill, man!

1409
01:13:17.169 --> 01:13:18.377
Geishu! Attack!

1410
01:13:19.711 --> 01:13:21.502
Are you in labour or what?!

1411
01:13:21.586 --> 01:13:23.586
Okay, I have an idea...

1412
01:13:23.836 --> 01:13:25.169
- Something I saw on the internet...

1413
01:13:25.461 --> 01:13:26.669
Drive on the side...

1414
01:13:26.919 --> 01:13:28.669
- What are you planning?
- Just wait...


1415
01:13:29.711 --> 01:13:32.627
- What are you doing, man?
- You drive like an old lady!


1416
01:13:32.877 --> 01:13:33.836
Hi!

1417
01:13:36.336 --> 01:13:37.252
Take that!

1418
01:13:40.294 --> 01:13:42.836
- Arjun! Arjun! What do I do?!
- Brake !! Brake!! Brake!!


1419
01:13:47.544 --> 01:13:48.377
Geishu!

1420
01:13:50.961 --> 01:13:51.877
Uh oh...

1421
01:13:52.002 --> 01:13:53.336
Oh, man...

1422
01:13:59.752 --> 01:14:00.919
What do we do?

1423
01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:08.252
There's a hammer in the garage...

1424
01:14:08.711 --> 01:14:10.461
Break everything in the house...

1425
01:14:11.461 --> 01:14:12.919
TV, fridge, AC... why not?

1426
01:14:13.002 --> 01:14:16.502
Dad, it's not his fault,
it's mine... I was driving.


1427
01:14:23.461 --> 01:14:26.211
What an embarrassing scolding!

1428
01:14:26.544 --> 01:14:28.002
He didn't even call
you an idiot or a jackass!


1429
01:14:28.086 --> 01:14:29.294
Come on!

1430
01:14:30.586 --> 01:14:32.211
- Rahul! Arjun!

1431
01:14:32.586 --> 01:14:34.502
Dadu's called everyone inside.

1432
01:14:35.086 --> 01:14:36.836
Let's go, step child.

1433
01:14:43.086 --> 01:14:45.294
This cake tastes like poop!

1434
01:14:46.419 --> 01:14:47.752
You've tasted poop, Dadu?

1435
01:14:47.919 --> 01:14:49.461
Shut up, you fool!

1436
01:14:49.544 --> 01:14:52.002
It's sugar free because
of your diabetes.


1437
01:14:53.419 --> 01:14:58.461
I would rather die eating
sugar than relive that party.


1438
01:15:00.252 --> 01:15:05.294
So... Is anyone going
to apologise for yesterday?


1439
01:15:10.294 --> 01:15:11.919
Okay, I'll start...

1440
01:15:13.169 --> 01:15:18.252
I'm sorry for calling
that idiot Choksi a shithead.


1441
01:15:19.377 --> 01:15:23.794
By the way... who invited Choksi?

1442
01:15:28.752 --> 01:15:29.669
I'm sorry, Dadu...

1443
01:15:31.752 --> 01:15:34.252
And... who invited Anu?

1444
01:15:39.627 --> 01:15:41.294
That was me, again...

1445
01:15:41.836 --> 01:15:44.919
I just thought I'd invite
some of Dad's colleagues...


1446
01:15:46.294 --> 01:15:47.419
Sorry...

1447
01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:51.877
Alright then, that's settled.

1448
01:15:52.127 --> 01:15:53.419
Can I have that?

1449
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:56.336
- What are you doing?
- My toy... My wish.


1450
01:15:56.461 --> 01:15:57.586
Go stand there.

1451
01:15:57.961 --> 01:15:59.961
- I want to take a picture...
- Come on, Dad...


1452
01:16:00.127 --> 01:16:01.877
- Okay guys, gather around.

1453
01:16:03.419 --> 01:16:05.377
Smile, smile, smile...

1454
01:16:05.544 --> 01:16:06.544
Smile...

1455
01:16:09.002 --> 01:16:11.377
I wish Shashi and family were here...

1456
01:16:11.544 --> 01:16:14.877
- I would have my happy family photo.
- He's coming tonight.


1457
01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:16.502
And you can have your family photo!

1458
01:16:16.586 --> 01:16:19.544
We must click the photograph soon...

1459
01:16:19.794 --> 01:16:22.586
...or else I might be
the one cut out of it!


1460
01:16:22.836 --> 01:16:25.461
Dad, why must you
always talk about dying?


1461
01:16:25.752 --> 01:16:32.211
Speaking of death... Rahul,
have you booked my burial spot?


1462
01:16:32.336 --> 01:16:33.127
- What?!
- Dadu... I...


1463
01:16:33.336 --> 01:16:34.336
What's this new nonsense?

1464
01:16:34.419 --> 01:16:37.877
Dadu said he wants to be
buried... I thought it was a joke...


1465
01:16:38.002 --> 01:16:39.544
Dad, they won't allow it!

1466
01:16:39.627 --> 01:16:41.502
People can't just
change their religion!


1467
01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:45.461
Whether you're a man or tomato...
once you're dead, you're dead.


1468
01:16:47.127 --> 01:16:49.211
- Arjun!
- Yes?


1469
01:16:49.502 --> 01:16:52.336
Go book my burial spot...

1470
01:16:52.711 --> 01:16:53.961
Umm... Dad?

1471
01:16:54.419 --> 01:16:55.211
Dad!

1472
01:16:55.294 --> 01:16:59.502
What, Dad-Dad?!
I'm dying, not him!


1473
01:16:59.836 --> 01:17:02.044
I never know what's
going on in this house...


1474
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:07.836
- Where are we going?

1475
01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:10.377
- On a date.
- Ohh... Hawaii!


1476
01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:13.086
Nah... even better!

1477
01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:14.169
Really!

1478
01:17:14.252 --> 01:17:15.752
Really. You'll see!

1479
01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:32.211
What would your tombstone read?

1480
01:17:34.627 --> 01:17:35.794
Tia Mallik...

1481
01:17:36.794 --> 01:17:38.794
Struck down by Boobly's love...

1482
01:17:39.294 --> 01:17:40.586
For eternity.

1483
01:17:40.752 --> 01:17:42.086
So romantic...

1484
01:17:42.336 --> 01:17:44.252
I can make my pecs dance like Boobly.

1485
01:17:44.877 --> 01:17:46.086
Let's see!

1486
01:17:46.544 --> 01:17:47.711
Hang on...

1487
01:17:50.294 --> 01:17:52.336
- Nothing's happening!
- It's inside the t-shirt!


1488
01:17:52.419 --> 01:17:53.752
Show me, then!

1489
01:17:55.919 --> 01:17:57.711
There's no one like Boobly!

1490
01:18:08.961 --> 01:18:11.336
- I don't know Rahul that well...

1491
01:18:12.294 --> 01:18:13.544
but...

1492
01:18:14.169 --> 01:18:18.419
Maybe the similarities between
your novels really was co-incidence?


1493
01:18:22.544 --> 01:18:23.752
Maybe.

1494
01:18:26.544 --> 01:18:29.252
You're really defending
him... What's up?


1495
01:18:31.086 --> 01:18:32.377
Nothing at all...

1496
01:18:33.002 --> 01:18:34.877
Really... you can tell me!

1497
01:18:43.544 --> 01:18:45.127
I got you something!

1498
01:18:46.086 --> 01:18:47.169
Really?

1499
01:18:47.252 --> 01:18:48.169
What?

1500
01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:51.419
What are you doing?!

1501
01:18:51.502 --> 01:18:52.419
Tia...

1502
01:18:52.502 --> 01:18:53.211
Arjun?

1503
01:18:53.294 --> 01:18:54.752
Will you...

1504
01:18:56.877 --> 01:18:58.169
have some sweet cigarettes?

1505
01:18:58.252 --> 01:19:00.794
Oh my God! Are you serious?!

1506
01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.836
How can I say no?

1507
01:19:03.502 --> 01:19:04.211
Light?

1508
01:19:04.294 --> 01:19:05.627
Oh! Yes, ma'am!

1509
01:19:07.544 --> 01:19:08.752
Thank you.

1510
01:19:51.836 --> 01:19:53.877
Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday...

1511
01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:55.711
About Choksi Uncle and Dadu...

1512
01:19:55.836 --> 01:19:57.294
Are you crazy?! I'm sorry!

1513
01:19:57.586 --> 01:19:59.586
My family doesn't
usually behave like that...


1514
01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:01.711
Correction...

1515
01:20:02.252 --> 01:20:04.336
they don't behave
like that in public.


1516
01:20:05.711 --> 01:20:07.794
You should be happy you have a family...

1517
01:20:12.169 --> 01:20:14.586
You really miss your family, don't you?

1518
01:20:22.336 --> 01:20:23.252
So!

1519
01:20:24.127 --> 01:20:25.961
What would your tombstone say?

1520
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:28.836
Let's see... Arjun Kapoor...

1521
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:31.877
from 1985 tom'?

1522
01:20:32.211 --> 01:20:33.836
2050, at least!

1523
01:20:33.919 --> 01:20:35.919
Okay, 2050 at least.

1524
01:20:36.836 --> 01:20:38.419
Right... Okay...

1525
01:20:41.502 --> 01:20:43.002
'These are my last few words...'

1526
01:20:43.961 --> 01:20:45.627
'Remember my story... If you can.'

1527
01:20:52.794 --> 01:20:54.252
That's damn impressive!

1528
01:20:54.877 --> 01:20:55.919
You like it?

1529
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:59.836
I mean... Oh, look at me, 
I'm a writer...

1530
01:21:00.336 --> 01:21:01.377
Yeah...

1531
01:21:01.836 --> 01:21:03.252
Just a little... Thank you.

1532
01:21:11.294 --> 01:21:13.211
- Thanks for these.
- You're welcome...


1533
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:15.169
How much longer are you here?

1534
01:21:15.794 --> 01:21:17.544
<i>2</i> days... and you?

1535
01:21:18.544 --> 01:21:19.544
4 days...

1536
01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:20.544
Oh.

1537
01:21:26.669 --> 01:21:31.211
Okay, listen... this may sound
a bit crazy... but...


1538
01:21:33.336 --> 01:21:35.211
When we're together...

1539
01:21:36.086 --> 01:21:38.252
I don't know... 
It feels like...

1540
01:21:39.211 --> 01:21:40.669
It just... Something just...

1541
01:21:42.211 --> 01:21:43.336
- Fits?
- Yeah...


1542
01:21:43.794 --> 01:21:45.169
Does it feel like that to you?

1543
01:21:45.711 --> 01:21:46.586
Yeah.

1544
01:21:48.252 --> 01:21:49.586
Stay back a few days?

1545
01:21:52.794 --> 01:21:55.211
If not for me, then for Bunkoo?

1546
01:21:56.086 --> 01:21:56.794
Bunkoo...

1547
01:21:57.127 --> 01:22:01.086
For Bunkoo... I'm convinced. Yes!

1548
01:22:01.461 --> 01:22:03.252
Why few days... at least 10!

1549
01:22:06.252 --> 01:22:07.919
I had a great day...

1550
01:22:08.127 --> 01:22:09.377
Me too.

1551
01:22:10.502 --> 01:22:11.669
Okay, bye!

1552
01:22:15.836 --> 01:22:17.294
- Bye...
- Bye...


1553
01:22:18.961 --> 01:22:19.961
Bye...

1554
01:22:24.877 --> 01:22:26.211
I was in a graveyard.

1555
01:22:28.252 --> 01:22:29.502
On a date...

1556
01:22:34.002 --> 01:22:35.461
With Arjun...

1557
01:22:36.002 --> 01:22:36.877
Yeah...

1558
01:22:40.002 --> 01:22:41.461
I really like him.

1559
01:22:42.752 --> 01:22:47.211
I wish I hadn't made such
a mess by kissing his brother!


1560
01:22:52.877 --> 01:22:55.461
- Arjun, where are the car keys?

1561
01:22:56.544 --> 01:22:58.627
- Arjun! Where is he?!

1562
01:23:05.127 --> 01:23:06.002
- Arjun?

1563
01:23:22.461 --> 01:23:23.586
What's up?

1564
01:23:24.294 --> 01:23:27.211
Nothing! Mom's phone is here...

1565
01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:29.044
She asked for it...

1566
01:23:29.627 --> 01:23:31.127
- Thanks.
- Yeah.


1567
01:23:32.836 --> 01:23:36.211
- Arjun! Rahul!
Look who's here! It's Shashi Uncle!


1568
01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:38.627
Sorry Dadu, we missed your birthday...

1569
01:23:40.252 --> 01:23:42.877
And finally!! Uncle! Aunty!

1570
01:23:43.044 --> 01:23:45.002
Hi! How are you?

1571
01:23:45.211 --> 01:23:47.336
- Hi Aunty, looking nice!
- How was the cruise?


1572
01:23:50.252 --> 01:23:51.461
Hey Rahul!

1573
01:23:52.211 --> 01:23:54.919
Look how excited Dadu
is with his wheelchair!


1574
01:23:55.086 --> 01:23:57.294
- Don't worry about it,
we've booked a room at Elgon Hotel.


1575
01:23:57.544 --> 01:23:59.002
He says he's going to a hotel!

1576
01:23:59.169 --> 01:24:03.211
You're home now, idiot...
You're staying here!


1577
01:24:03.961 --> 01:24:07.752
Listen now! I want to take a
picture of the whole family tomorrow.


1578
01:24:07.919 --> 01:24:09.211
- I want to put it up.

1579
01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:12.211
You know that duffer friend of yours...

1580
01:24:12.294 --> 01:24:14.377
The photographer? 
I'll call him!

1581
01:24:14.627 --> 01:24:16.086
- Dharmendra, take the bags in now!

1582
01:24:16.461 --> 01:24:18.211
Take these bags into the room.

1583
01:24:19.586 --> 01:24:21.752
Come on, let's all have dinner.

1584
01:24:23.627 --> 01:24:26.336
- Sunita, look what I found!
- What?


1585
01:24:26.419 --> 01:24:28.294
Gorgeous pictures!

1586
01:24:28.586 --> 01:24:30.419
That's from our honeymoon...

1587
01:24:30.627 --> 01:24:33.294
Some wine for the hardworking ladies!

1588
01:24:33.377 --> 01:24:34.794
Thank you!

1589
01:24:35.086 --> 01:24:37.961
Wow! Please teach her something...

1590
01:24:38.044 --> 01:24:40.211
Shut up! Just go!

1591
01:24:40.252 --> 01:24:43.336
Sunita, ask Timmy to
e-mail me some recipes.


1592
01:24:43.544 --> 01:24:45.294
Sharic just loves this stuff!

1593
01:24:45.419 --> 01:24:47.252
Of course,
she'll e-mail you tomorrow itself!


1594
01:24:47.377 --> 01:24:50.294
Sunita! This custard is delicious!

1595
01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:53.169
- Rahul, you ass!

1596
01:24:53.336 --> 01:24:54.586
Let me have a little!

1597
01:24:54.711 --> 01:24:55.502
- Dad...

1598
01:24:55.586 --> 01:24:57.127
Dad! You're not allowed!
Doctors' instructions!


1599
01:24:57.211 --> 01:24:58.252
Just one!

1600
01:24:58.336 --> 01:25:00.836
Sunita, you look like
a Bollywood actress!


1601
01:25:00.919 --> 01:25:02.002
Let me see!

1602
01:25:03.502 --> 01:25:04.794
Wow! Seriously!

1603
01:25:04.961 --> 01:25:07.127
- She really does!

1604
01:25:08.461 --> 01:25:09.544
Wow...

1605
01:25:09.877 --> 01:25:12.211
Please, Sharic... I was way
better looking than you!


1606
01:25:12.294 --> 01:25:14.752
Girls used to line
up here for Shashi and me!


1607
01:25:14.836 --> 01:25:15.752
Of course!

1608
01:25:15.919 --> 01:25:17.836
- Rubbish, Dad...
- Hang on!


1609
01:25:18.377 --> 01:25:20.377
They used to line up for me.

1610
01:25:21.002 --> 01:25:23.086
- Absolutely right!
- Correct, Dadu!


1611
01:25:23.169 --> 01:25:25.044
- And what was Grandma doing?
- She was long gone!


1612
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:27.627
Whatever it is! 
I miss those days...

1613
01:25:27.836 --> 01:25:30.127
I wouldn't give those memories
up for a million dollars...


1614
01:25:30.252 --> 01:25:31.461
Oh, Uncle...

1615
01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:33.377
Please! You'd eat poop
for a million dollars!


1616
01:25:33.544 --> 01:25:34.586
- Yuck!
- Dad!


1617
01:25:36.002 --> 01:25:38.044
You'll would all eat
poop for 10 million dollars!


1618
01:25:38.211 --> 01:25:40.169
Sharic would eat poop for 50 bucks!

1619
01:25:41.544 --> 01:25:42.461
- So Sharic...

1620
01:25:43.169 --> 01:25:45.002
ls the guitar just for girls or...

1621
01:25:45.086 --> 01:25:47.294
- No, no! I play!
- Play some Mehmood!


1622
01:25:47.377 --> 01:25:49.711
- Justin Bieber, bro!
- No Justin Bieber!


1623
01:25:49.877 --> 01:25:51.211
Play something vintage!

1624
01:25:51.919 --> 01:25:54.211
Rahul also sings!
Rahul, come on, sing!


1625
01:25:54.461 --> 01:25:57.127
Please, please! Come on, Rahul!

1626
01:25:57.211 --> 01:25:59.044
- Sing what...
- Your Dad's favourite!


1627
01:25:59.127 --> 01:26:00.836
The one he sang at his wedding!
Remember?


1628
01:26:00.919 --> 01:26:02.211
Me?! No way...

1629
01:26:02.502 --> 01:26:04.294
"The way you look tonight!"

1630
01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:07.377
In the voice of Lata
Mangeshkar... Rahul!


1631
01:26:07.461 --> 01:26:08.586
Let’s go!

1632
01:26:09.086 --> 01:26:11.211
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

1633
01:27:07.752 --> 01:27:08.586
- WOW, Dad!

1634
01:27:38.544 --> 01:27:40.002
- Well done, Rahul-
- Kapoor!


1635
01:27:40.461 --> 01:27:41.294
- Wonderfully done!

1636
01:27:41.502 --> 01:27:44.044
Goodnight, my little princess!

1637
01:27:44.169 --> 01:27:46.627
You smell like Geishu!

1638
01:27:53.586 --> 01:27:54.961
Goodnight.

1639
01:27:56.211 --> 01:27:57.336
Goodnight.

1640
01:28:00.836 --> 01:28:03.211
I haven't seen you this happy
in a long time... It suits you.


1641
01:28:07.252 --> 01:28:08.336
Goodnight!

1642
01:28:13.211 --> 01:28:15.544
Dadu... Aunty got this for Morn!

1643
01:28:15.627 --> 01:28:18.919
Shut up and tell me how
long I have to keep this on!


1644
01:28:21.961 --> 01:28:23.461
15 minutes...

1645
01:28:24.336 --> 01:28:25.252
15 minutes?

1646
01:28:26.336 --> 01:28:28.252
Okay, switch off the lights.

1647
01:28:29.044 --> 01:28:29.877
Why?!

1648
01:28:29.961 --> 01:28:32.252
Because I said so!

1649
01:28:34.752 --> 01:28:37.419
Open the drawer... the first one!

1650
01:28:38.419 --> 01:28:39.836
See my underwear there?

1651
01:28:40.002 --> 01:28:41.002
What are you making me do?!

1652
01:28:41.086 --> 01:28:43.377
There's a box underneath. Open it...

1653
01:28:47.044 --> 01:28:48.627
Take the joint out.

1654
01:28:51.211 --> 01:28:53.044
Dadu... You'll have me killed!

1655
01:28:53.419 --> 01:28:55.502
Remember this? Gulmarg...

1656
01:28:57.711 --> 01:28:59.711
- Sonmarg.
- Yeah, Sonmarg...


1657
01:29:00.294 --> 01:29:05.877
And that ski instructor
who kept trying to grab your hand.


1658
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:09.544
- Remember this?
When you threw all my clothes out?


1659
01:29:09.919 --> 01:29:14.877
So'? You promised me a day
out and worked all clay instead.


1660
01:29:15.377 --> 01:29:19.586
Didn't I make it up
to you with my towel dance?


1661
01:29:21.919 --> 01:29:23.711
Yes, I saw the pictures...

1662
01:29:25.461 --> 01:29:28.586
You look nice.
A tad bit overweight... but cute.


1663
01:29:30.044 --> 01:29:32.211
But do you have
to sit next to Chris?

1664
01:29:33.419 --> 01:29:35.752
No, I'm not the jealous type.

1665
01:29:36.836 --> 01:29:39.169
Listen... I'll talk to you later, yeah?

1666
01:29:39.627 --> 01:29:40.419
I love you too.

1667
01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:44.086
2 drags and you're
already breaking glasses?


1668
01:29:44.211 --> 01:29:46.002
You're going to get me killed...

1669
01:29:46.086 --> 01:29:48.794
Just relax, son...

1670
01:29:52.836 --> 01:29:54.752
- Hold this, hold this!
- Why me?!


1671
01:29:56.252 --> 01:29:58.377
- It's Rahul! Come on in.
- Hey...


1672
01:29:59.586 --> 01:30:00.377
What's going on?

1673
01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:03.586
I've applied a mud cap...
The doctor recommended it...


1674
01:30:03.877 --> 01:30:05.336
Yeah, the doctors...

1675
01:30:08.502 --> 01:30:11.461
If you're done praying,
take the incense out...


1676
01:30:11.711 --> 01:30:12.877
Ummm...

1677
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:21.794
Let's see the... incense.

1678
01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:24.752
Oh, damn it!

1679
01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:26.586
Show me!

1680
01:30:27.252 --> 01:30:29.419
Busted!

1681
01:30:31.086 --> 01:30:32.877
Outlaws...

1682
01:30:33.211 --> 01:30:35.127
Wicked!

1683
01:30:44.502 --> 01:30:47.002
We used to be so happy...

1684
01:30:51.294 --> 01:30:53.627
Sunita, I was thinking...

1685
01:30:55.002 --> 01:30:56.336
If you want to...

1686
01:30:57.252 --> 01:31:02.461
start your catering
business... you should.


1687
01:31:09.586 --> 01:31:13.461
I'll try and help
in whatever way I can...


1688
01:31:13.961 --> 01:31:16.836
Is this the alcohol talking?

1689
01:31:20.086 --> 01:31:22.419
What would Grandma think
if she were here today...


1690
01:31:22.586 --> 01:31:28.586
You have no idea... She would be
taking a hit or two of the joint herself!


1691
01:31:29.002 --> 01:31:31.002
- Dadu!
- What nonsense, Dadu!


1692
01:31:31.169 --> 01:31:33.502
I'm telling you guys!

1693
01:31:34.002 --> 01:31:39.169
We used be quite the
'wild couple' in our times!


1694
01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:43.086
Then I've definitely fallen
on you guys!


1695
01:31:44.086 --> 01:31:46.627
This poor fellow turned
out like Morn and Dad...


1696
01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:48.252
What rubbish! I'm Wild.

1697
01:31:48.877 --> 01:31:49.877
- You?!
- Yeah!


1698
01:31:49.961 --> 01:31:51.586
- I'm wild!
- You're wild?


1699
01:31:51.752 --> 01:31:53.669
- I'm wild, dude!
- Wild people can drive!


1700
01:31:53.752 --> 01:31:56.336
- Shut up, I'm wild!
- Ya, right...


1701
01:31:56.502 --> 01:31:59.377
Okay, fine.
Tell us one of your wild tales.


1702
01:32:00.377 --> 01:32:04.294
In Hawaii last year...
I got drunk and got a tattoo.


1703
01:32:04.586 --> 01:32:06.419
What?! Tattoo?!

1704
01:32:06.711 --> 01:32:08.669
Is that a tattoo of pigeons?!

1705
01:32:10.461 --> 01:32:12.086
He got a tattoo!!!

1706
01:32:14.627 --> 01:32:18.419
Sunita, I just got tangled
up in so many things...


1707
01:32:21.336 --> 01:32:23.627
Before I knew it,
time had slipped away...


1708
01:32:26.044 --> 01:32:27.169
I'm sorry.

1709
01:32:28.752 --> 01:32:31.627
I may be drunk, but it's the truth...

1710
01:32:37.544 --> 01:32:39.752
Can't we be happy again?

1711
01:32:43.294 --> 01:32:44.711
We can try...

1712
01:32:52.377 --> 01:32:53.544
You're lost in thought?

1713
01:32:54.711 --> 01:32:56.127
I was just thinking...

1714
01:32:56.419 --> 01:32:58.711
For 10 million dollars...
I could eat some poop.


1715
01:32:58.794 --> 01:33:00.752
You'll eat it for 5!

1716
01:33:00.836 --> 01:33:02.336
Yeah... but with cheese.

1717
01:33:02.461 --> 01:33:04.002
Yuck!

1718
01:33:06.586 --> 01:33:08.336
Dude, where did
Dadu score that shit from?


1719
01:33:09.419 --> 01:33:10.836
Who knows...

1720
01:33:12.752 --> 01:33:15.627
You're not as perfect as you act...

1721
01:33:16.086 --> 01:33:19.252
How did you become the favourite son?

1722
01:33:22.002 --> 01:33:23.419
That's not true.

1723
01:33:24.086 --> 01:33:25.877
Morn and Dad love us equally.

1724
01:33:30.086 --> 01:33:32.377
You asshole... you can't even
say that with a straight face!


1725
01:33:32.502 --> 01:33:33.836
I am serious.

1726
01:33:36.044 --> 01:33:38.544
I would take your
place in a heartbeat.


1727
01:33:38.752 --> 01:33:40.002
Shut up...

1728
01:33:41.461 --> 01:33:43.002
Arjun, can I tell you something?

1729
01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.419
Something no one knows...

1730
01:33:51.961 --> 01:33:52.794
Arjun!

1731
01:34:14.919 --> 01:34:16.461
I thought you could wear this...

1732
01:34:16.627 --> 01:34:18.377
- Is it okay?
- Thank you.


1733
01:34:21.502 --> 01:34:22.794
Coffee...

1734
01:34:25.752 --> 01:34:27.961
I'll just go give
the car to the mechanic.


1735
01:34:28.336 --> 01:34:29.336
Now?!

1736
01:34:29.419 --> 01:34:30.836
Yeah, just get it out of the way...

1737
01:34:31.044 --> 01:34:33.627
Everyone's waiting outside!

1738
01:34:36.544 --> 01:34:38.419
I'll be back quickly. 
Where's Shashi?

1739
01:34:38.502 --> 01:34:40.502
- Pleasure meeting you.
- You too, sir.


1740
01:34:40.627 --> 01:34:43.127
- Okay, we'll talk later.
- Yeah. Sorry, I'm just...


1741
01:34:43.294 --> 01:34:44.377
Bye.

1742
01:34:46.336 --> 01:34:47.169
What's up, man?

1743
01:34:47.252 --> 01:34:48.836
You'll carry on...
I'll come in a bit.


1744
01:34:51.086 --> 01:34:51.794
Very bad...

1745
01:34:51.877 --> 01:34:53.836
I can't let you do this. No, Arjun...

1746
01:34:54.086 --> 01:34:58.377
- The car needs to go back.
- I'll come on my own!


1747
01:34:58.836 --> 01:35:01.419
That's where my family
portrait will be.


1748
01:35:01.877 --> 01:35:06.336
Timmy, you haven't sent the recipes!
Okay wait, I'll check.


1749
01:35:06.794 --> 01:35:08.669
Wow, Sunita, you look lovely!

1750
01:35:09.002 --> 01:35:10.169
Just speaking to Timmy for you!

1751
01:35:10.544 --> 01:35:12.711
I'll check on Rahul's laptop...

1752
01:35:13.586 --> 01:35:15.877
Uff, Dad... Too handsome!

1753
01:35:16.461 --> 01:35:18.461
No, no... Aunty wished me already.

1754
01:35:18.961 --> 01:35:21.586
Thank you for calling... and wishing...

1755
01:35:22.002 --> 01:35:23.044
Bye.

1756
01:35:24.711 --> 01:35:26.211
Is today your birthday?

1757
01:35:27.836 --> 01:35:29.002
Seriously?

1758
01:35:30.127 --> 01:35:32.627
T! Happy birthday!

1759
01:35:32.794 --> 01:35:33.711
Thank you...

1760
01:35:33.919 --> 01:35:36.669
I'd have brought a
cutout of Boobly if I knew!


1761
01:35:39.961 --> 01:35:42.752
Why aren't you more excited
about your birthday?!


1762
01:35:47.461 --> 01:35:49.502
- It's loading, hang on!

1763
01:35:49.836 --> 01:35:50.669
- Sunita!

1764
01:35:50.836 --> 01:35:52.961
Sorry, one sec... 
I'll call back.

1765
01:35:53.086 --> 01:35:54.336
Which one?

1766
01:35:54.502 --> 01:35:55.502
This one!

1767
01:35:55.627 --> 01:35:56.627
<i>'</i> Okay!

1768
01:35:58.086 --> 01:36:00.919
You should think of investing
in my Artist Retreat!


1769
01:36:03.336 --> 01:36:05.211
Raj, stop the car... Stop the car.

1770
01:36:06.002 --> 01:36:07.086
What's wrong?

1771
01:36:07.586 --> 01:36:10.002
No, I just remembered
I have to see a friend...


1772
01:36:10.211 --> 01:36:11.377
Should I wait?

1773
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:15.377
No, you guys carry on.

1774
01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:18.002
- Do you know the way?
- Yes, sir!


1775
01:36:46.252 --> 01:36:47.419
Hello? Dad?

1776
01:36:47.627 --> 01:36:48.836
- I'll be home in a bit...

1777
01:36:49.002 --> 01:36:52.669
Just finishing work at the garage...
will be home in half an hour.


1778
01:36:56.169 --> 01:36:57.836
Time to go, right?

1779
01:37:02.252 --> 01:37:05.461
Seems like your mind
is made up... and that's fine.


1780
01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:09.336
Nothing's fine... but
I'm trying to change that.


1781
01:37:32.336 --> 01:37:35.294
It was my 13th birthday...

1782
01:37:36.336 --> 01:37:41.669
Morn and Dad were returning
from Canada after my Uncle's surgery...


1783
01:37:44.002 --> 01:37:45.627
I was really pissed off...

1784
01:37:46.544 --> 01:37:49.752
They were missing my birthday...

1785
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:55.877
They called me before
boarding the flight...


1786
01:37:57.544 --> 01:37:59.127
I was angry...

1787
01:38:00.627 --> 01:38:03.169
So told them not
to bother coming back...


1788
01:38:03.752 --> 01:38:07.377
I don't need a Morn and Dad!
I'm fine alone! Don't come back.


1789
01:38:12.961 --> 01:38:14.294
The plane crashed.

1790
01:38:19.377 --> 01:38:22.336
My Uncle waited 2 days to tell me...

1791
01:38:22.502 --> 01:38:24.502
Til they found the bodies

1792
01:38:33.461 --> 01:38:37.252
It was the last time...
I ever spoke to them...


1793
01:38:37.336 --> 01:38:40.044
...and I was horrible...

1794
01:38:41.836 --> 01:38:45.002
That phone call haunts
me on every birthday!


1795
01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:48.044
I could have said so many things...

1796
01:38:50.336 --> 01:38:51.961
Like I love you!

1797
01:38:52.544 --> 01:38:56.002
I love you... Just come back...
I miss you!


1798
01:38:56.336 --> 01:38:58.086
I've missed you!

1799
01:39:05.544 --> 01:39:07.586
Just please come back...

1800
01:39:08.377 --> 01:39:10.169
It's all I wanted to say.

1801
01:39:33.794 --> 01:39:35.044
Hello...

1802
01:39:36.877 --> 01:39:37.919
ls Dad there?

1803
01:39:39.919 --> 01:39:41.002
Rahul...

1804
01:39:42.002 --> 01:39:43.419
Stop!

1805
01:40:05.252 --> 01:40:06.252
Rahul!

1806
01:40:53.002 --> 01:40:53.961
Sorry.

1807
01:40:55.544 --> 01:40:56.919
Excuse me for a second...

1808
01:41:05.211 --> 01:41:07.169
You have to tell him.

1809
01:41:13.336 --> 01:41:14.211
- Arjun...

1810
01:41:15.419 --> 01:41:17.586
I have to tell you something.

1811
01:41:19.127 --> 01:41:23.794
Please don't judge me...
I was drunk.


1812
01:41:24.377 --> 01:41:27.086
- Catch that thief! Catch her!

1813
01:41:27.294 --> 01:41:30.169
Rahul! Look what I taught the kids!

1814
01:41:35.169 --> 01:41:38.836
- Tell everyone to hurry up!
- It's going to rain...


1815
01:41:39.002 --> 01:41:40.877
Bite your black tongue you jackass!

1816
01:41:41.086 --> 01:41:41.919
Rahul!

1817
01:41:42.127 --> 01:41:44.169
Do you have a belt for Sharic?

1818
01:41:44.377 --> 01:41:45.711
I'll check...

1819
01:41:48.211 --> 01:41:49.211
Hi!

1820
01:41:52.627 --> 01:41:54.252
You were calling earlier...

1821
01:41:56.461 --> 01:41:59.461
No! Why would you say that?

1822
01:42:03.419 --> 01:42:06.044
Nothing, just
having a bit of a rough day...


1823
01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:13.627
Thanks...

1824
01:42:16.794 --> 01:42:17.752
What's wrong, Ma?

1825
01:42:19.002 --> 01:42:20.669
You're hiding something from me.

1826
01:42:24.086 --> 01:42:25.836
Listen, I'll just call you back.

1827
01:42:29.169 --> 01:42:30.294
What are you hiding?

1828
01:42:33.044 --> 01:42:34.794
Do you know where Dad is?

1829
01:42:35.002 --> 01:42:36.377
Don't change the topic!

1830
01:42:36.752 --> 01:42:38.086
Answer me!

1831
01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:43.252
Whose photographs are on your laptop?

1832
01:42:44.711 --> 01:42:46.919
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.


1833
01:42:47.377 --> 01:42:49.294
They're definitely
not your girlfriend's.


1834
01:42:53.211 --> 01:42:54.919
Why were you looking at my laptop?

1835
01:42:55.294 --> 01:42:56.961
Move, Geishu.

1836
01:42:58.419 --> 01:42:59.586
Do you even have a girlfriend?

1837
01:42:59.669 --> 01:43:00.669
- Move, Geishu!

1838
01:43:01.086 --> 01:43:02.419
I want a name.

1839
01:43:02.544 --> 01:43:05.127
- Tell me the name!
- None of your business!


1840
01:43:05.627 --> 01:43:07.877
Rahul, don't lie to me.

1841
01:43:09.419 --> 01:43:13.127
Those photographs...
This is a misunderstanding, right?


1842
01:43:14.294 --> 01:43:15.752
- I don't have time for this.
- Rahul!


1843
01:43:18.419 --> 01:43:19.544
Ma, don't!

1844
01:43:22.377 --> 01:43:23.752
This is your girlfriend?!

1845
01:43:25.169 --> 01:43:26.127
This!

1846
01:43:26.627 --> 01:43:27.627
Disgusting!

1847
01:43:28.752 --> 01:43:30.252
Do you feel no shame?!

1848
01:43:30.711 --> 01:43:32.627
When did these lies start?

1849
01:43:34.002 --> 01:43:36.627
Did you think about us even once?!

1850
01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:38.377
About Dadu, about Dad...

1851
01:43:38.461 --> 01:43:40.127
Think about Dad?!

1852
01:43:41.919 --> 01:43:44.002
Dad told you he's
at the garage, right?


1853
01:43:44.377 --> 01:43:47.169
No one's a saint in
this house... Everybody lies!


1854
01:43:47.377 --> 01:43:49.044
So instead of finding faults with me...

1855
01:43:49.127 --> 01:43:50.294
save your own bloody marriage!

1856
01:43:50.377 --> 01:43:51.419
Shut up!

1857
01:43:54.877 --> 01:43:56.502
Rahul, the belt...

1858
01:43:57.961 --> 01:43:59.627
- All okay?
- Yeah, it's fine...


1859
01:43:59.794 --> 01:44:02.377
I'll just get it.
You go, I'll bring it...


1860
01:44:03.419 --> 01:44:05.711
- Okay... Ready... and smile!

1861
01:44:06.586 --> 01:44:07.211
- Got it!

1862
01:44:07.627 --> 01:44:09.336
- Now... take a picture of me
as I pretend to be dead.


1863
01:44:09.419 --> 01:44:10.544
Like this.

1864
01:44:11.627 --> 01:44:12.669
Wait!

1865
01:44:14.377 --> 01:44:15.836
- Ready.
- I'll click?


1866
01:44:16.044 --> 01:44:17.419
Got it. You look
very cute, Dadu.


1867
01:44:17.502 --> 01:44:19.627
If my Grandma was alive,
I'd totally set you two up.


1868
01:44:19.752 --> 01:44:21.752
- Really?
- What about your mum?


1869
01:44:23.127 --> 01:44:24.502
- Harsh!
- Yes?


1870
01:44:25.211 --> 01:44:27.419
- Tell everyone to hurry up!
- Okay...


1871
01:44:27.502 --> 01:44:30.044
- It'll get too overcast
to take the picture!


1872
01:44:40.086 --> 01:44:41.919
You said you were at the garage.

1873
01:44:43.711 --> 01:44:45.169
Rahul, I...

1874
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:48.419
You're a disgusting person, Dad.

1875
01:44:51.002 --> 01:44:53.627
I was the one who
took a stand for you.


1876
01:44:55.836 --> 01:44:57.044
I'm sorry...

1877
01:44:58.211 --> 01:44:59.419
You're sorry?!

1878
01:45:01.836 --> 01:45:03.919
It's not what you think, Rahul...

1879
01:45:07.294 --> 01:45:09.086
Let me explain...

1880
01:45:10.836 --> 01:45:12.127
Forget it...

1881
01:45:14.502 --> 01:45:17.752
- It's going to rain.
- What's taking so long?!


1882
01:45:17.919 --> 01:45:20.419
- Go and call everyone!
- Come on, come on!


1883
01:45:20.502 --> 01:45:22.252
Where's Arjun? Call him!

1884
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:23.752
Where were you?

1885
01:45:27.836 --> 01:45:29.169
There you'll are!

1886
01:45:29.252 --> 01:45:31.169
- Everyone's calling you'll!
- Corning...


1887
01:45:31.377 --> 01:45:33.961
- Aunty! Come!

1888
01:45:34.336 --> 01:45:35.836
- Arjun's not answering
his bloody phone.


1889
01:45:35.919 --> 01:45:38.377
- It's started drizzling!
- Aunty, sit here!


1890
01:45:38.461 --> 01:45:39.419
Okay...

1891
01:45:40.252 --> 01:45:42.502
- Quickly now! Fast!

1892
01:45:48.127 --> 01:45:51.044
- Sit there, baby.

1893
01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:54.211
- Sit there or she won't be seen.
- No no no! Not you!


1894
01:45:54.377 --> 01:45:56.002
Sit now. Come on...

1895
01:45:57.127 --> 01:45:58.919
Rahul, closer to your Mum.

1896
01:45:59.794 --> 01:46:01.336
- Show some love, guys!

1897
01:46:01.502 --> 01:46:02.961
- Okay, everyone ready?

1898
01:46:03.086 --> 01:46:04.377
Wait, where's Arjun?

1899
01:46:04.461 --> 01:46:06.336
- Where's Arjun?
- Arjun?


1900
01:46:06.502 --> 01:46:09.169
There you are!
Did you forget about the picture?


1901
01:46:09.252 --> 01:46:11.086
- Come on, Arjun!

1902
01:46:11.252 --> 01:46:12.877
- We were worried you had
gone back to America.


1903
01:46:12.961 --> 01:46:14.294
There! Next to Rahul!

1904
01:46:15.044 --> 01:46:16.919
- Next to Rahul!
- Come on!


1905
01:46:17.211 --> 01:46:20.252
- Hurry up now, it'll rain...

1906
01:46:22.044 --> 01:46:23.794
- Where were you, Arjun?

1907
01:46:24.127 --> 01:46:27.044
What are you planning
with all that space?


1908
01:46:27.211 --> 01:46:29.544
- Come closer!

1909
01:46:30.294 --> 01:46:31.252
Okay!

1910
01:46:31.419 --> 01:46:32.669
Why is only Dadu smiling?

1911
01:46:32.794 --> 01:46:34.627
Happy family photo!

1912
01:46:36.377 --> 01:46:39.044
Uncle! Put your arm around aunty!

1913
01:46:39.127 --> 01:46:41.627
- Like she's your wife!
- They're acting like neighbours...


1914
01:46:41.711 --> 01:46:44.502
The neighbor’s wife is way hotter.

1915
01:46:45.377 --> 01:46:46.961
Okay, focus!

1916
01:46:48.127 --> 01:46:49.252
What's wrong?

1917
01:46:49.419 --> 01:46:51.669
- Change the battery, you idiot!
- Oh, man...


1918
01:46:52.211 --> 01:46:54.127
- He's your friend, right?
- I want to go to the loo!


1919
01:46:54.252 --> 01:46:56.669
- No no!
- 2 minutes!


1920
01:46:56.836 --> 01:46:58.794
He should check the
battery beforehand...


1921
01:46:58.961 --> 01:47:01.627
- What are we waiting for?

1922
01:47:02.169 --> 01:47:03.794
Were you at Anu's?

1923
01:47:05.086 --> 01:47:06.961
We'll talk about this later...

1924
01:47:07.502 --> 01:47:08.586
- Camera ready!

1925
01:47:08.794 --> 01:47:11.377
- Where's Zoey?

1926
01:47:11.544 --> 01:47:12.544
What's wrong with you?

1927
01:47:12.669 --> 01:47:14.252
- Zoey, come back!
- Nothing.


1928
01:47:15.211 --> 01:47:16.419
Then why do you look so irritable?

1929
01:47:16.502 --> 01:47:18.336
Because you're the
scum of this earth.


1930
01:47:18.419 --> 01:47:20.419
- Okay, camera ready!

1931
01:47:23.211 --> 01:47:25.461
- Okay, ready! Smile!

1932
01:47:25.627 --> 01:47:26.961
Uncle, put your arm around Aunty!

1933
01:47:27.044 --> 01:47:29.961
- Come, come...
- Smile everyone!


1934
01:47:30.169 --> 01:47:31.127
- And...

1935
01:47:32.461 --> 01:47:33.461
Ready!

1936
01:47:34.044 --> 01:47:35.752
I've had enough.

1937
01:47:36.002 --> 01:47:37.419
- Sunita...
- Where's Aunty going?


1938
01:47:37.502 --> 01:47:39.711
- Sunita, I was joking!

1939
01:47:39.919 --> 01:47:42.044
I don't want any part
in this 'happy family' sham.


1940
01:47:42.127 --> 01:47:44.877
Everyone's waiting!
I'll tell you everything! Please!


1941
01:47:46.752 --> 01:47:48.169
- Tell me one thing...

1942
01:47:48.419 --> 01:47:50.544
Were you or were you not at Anu's?

1943
01:47:52.294 --> 01:47:53.252
I was.

1944
01:47:54.544 --> 01:47:55.461
Sunita...

1945
01:47:56.544 --> 01:47:59.419
Sunita... listen.
I went to end it.


1946
01:47:59.836 --> 01:48:02.211
I'll never go back again.

1947
01:48:02.627 --> 01:48:04.877
When did all this start?

1948
01:48:05.794 --> 01:48:06.752
One year...

1949
01:48:06.919 --> 01:48:09.086
- One year?!
- How does it matter now?


1950
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:13.836
Liars...

1951
01:48:14.127 --> 01:48:16.419
Both of you! Liars!

1952
01:48:17.461 --> 01:48:18.919
Happy now?

1953
01:48:19.086 --> 01:48:21.294
Satisfied? Isn't this what you wanted?

1954
01:48:21.419 --> 01:48:25.461
Why is he packing?! Stop packing!
Harsh! Harsh!


1955
01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:27.502
- They're all going...
- We can do it later!


1956
01:48:27.711 --> 01:48:29.086
- Let's do this tomorrow...
- Okay, tomorrow.


1957
01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:29.919
- Dadu!

1958
01:48:30.002 --> 01:48:32.169
Arjun... take the kids to a hotel.

1959
01:48:32.252 --> 01:48:33.752
What are you hiding this time?

1960
01:48:34.419 --> 01:48:36.669
- What are you talking about?
- Really?


1961
01:48:36.752 --> 01:48:38.419
I have no idea what
you're talking about!


1962
01:48:38.544 --> 01:48:40.336
So you didn't kiss Tia?

1963
01:48:42.877 --> 01:48:44.252
Why didn't you tell me?

1964
01:48:44.419 --> 01:48:45.294
Look, Arjun...

1965
01:48:45.419 --> 01:48:48.419
Frankly speaking,
I have no time for your love life.


1966
01:48:48.544 --> 01:48:50.711
If you think this is the
best time to talk about this...


1967
01:48:50.877 --> 01:48:53.461
- You can go sulk in some corner!
- Screw this photo!


1968
01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:56.086
- What happened?
- What's going on?


1969
01:48:56.336 --> 01:48:59.377
- Neetu, take the kids and go.
- Nothing's wrong, Dadu.


1970
01:49:01.961 --> 01:49:04.502
- Dad, you'll get wet!

1971
01:49:04.586 --> 01:49:06.794
Go. Please go to Anu's house.

1972
01:49:07.169 --> 01:49:08.211
That's what's best.

1973
01:49:09.086 --> 01:49:10.586
I'm apologizing to you.

1974
01:49:11.127 --> 01:49:13.169
I made a mistake.
I'm only human!


1975
01:49:13.502 --> 01:49:14.544
Sunita...

1976
01:49:26.461 --> 01:49:27.419
Dad!

1977
01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:29.044
Dad!

1978
01:49:50.211 --> 01:49:52.169
What's happening, Rahul?
ls everything okay?


1979
01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:53.794
Everything's fine, Uncle.
Please just handle everyone.


1980
01:49:53.877 --> 01:49:55.294
- Are you sure-
- Yes, I'm sure!


1981
01:49:55.377 --> 01:49:56.794
Please! I'll handle it.

1982
01:49:56.961 --> 01:49:58.419
- Ma...
- Neetu!


1983
01:49:59.377 --> 01:50:00.461
- Shashi!

1984
01:50:01.252 --> 01:50:02.919
- I'm coming, Dad!

1985
01:50:09.877 --> 01:50:11.336
I'll talk to him!

1986
01:50:11.461 --> 01:50:13.336
Dad... Everything's okay.

1987
01:50:13.419 --> 01:50:15.919
What nonsense!
They're all fighting outside!


1988
01:50:16.086 --> 01:50:17.627
I'm here to take care of it!

1989
01:50:24.336 --> 01:50:25.377
Ma...

1990
01:50:25.711 --> 01:50:28.169
I'm sorry for what I said before.

1991
01:50:29.377 --> 01:50:31.252
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

1992
01:50:31.336 --> 01:50:32.544
Go away, Rahul...

1993
01:50:34.836 --> 01:50:38.627
You lied to me... I don't
want to hear any more...


1994
01:50:39.294 --> 01:50:42.461
Ma... Is it the lies that hurt you...
or the truth?


1995
01:50:42.627 --> 01:50:45.544
You and I have no connection now.

1996
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:48.752
You're no one to me.

1997
01:50:50.086 --> 01:50:52.086
Ma... Please... 
Just listen to me.

1998
01:50:52.294 --> 01:50:53.752
Please... <i>2</i> minutes...

1999
01:50:53.919 --> 01:50:55.794
I know I lied.

2000
01:50:56.336 --> 01:50:57.711
I kept a lot of secrets...

2001
01:50:57.794 --> 01:51:01.794
I hurt you and I can
apologize for it all...


2002
01:51:02.252 --> 01:51:05.294
But how do I apologize
for who I really am?


2003
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:09.336
Rahul... my perfect son...

2004
01:51:09.544 --> 01:51:12.877
Morn, I'm tired of being perfect.

2005
01:51:13.461 --> 01:51:14.669
Please...

2006
01:51:16.044 --> 01:51:17.586
I don't want any of this...

2007
01:51:17.919 --> 01:51:21.252
I'm tired of running...
from myself... from you.


2008
01:51:21.461 --> 01:51:23.502
I'm tired of being afraid
of what people will say.


2009
01:51:24.419 --> 01:51:26.294
I am what I am, Ma...

2010
01:51:26.461 --> 01:51:29.377
and I just want you
to love me for who I am.


2011
01:51:32.211 --> 01:51:34.336
Where did I go so wrong...

2012
01:51:36.711 --> 01:51:40.377
- that everyone...
you, Arjun, your father...


2013
01:51:40.586 --> 01:51:42.669
. everyone's pushed me away.

2014
01:51:43.127 --> 01:51:46.711
- God will never forgive me...
- Please, Ma...


2015
01:51:46.961 --> 01:51:49.961
Go away, Rahul!
You've really hurt me!


2016
01:52:15.211 --> 01:52:16.919
Whatever I am today,
is because of you.


2017
01:52:17.002 --> 01:52:19.502
My book, my career... it's all you.

2018
01:52:21.502 --> 01:52:23.377
I've done something terrible, Rahul...

2019
01:52:25.419 --> 01:52:26.502
Rahul...

2020
01:52:28.252 --> 01:52:30.377
- Your book...
- Rahul!


2021
01:52:30.461 --> 01:52:33.919
The story that-

2022
01:52:34.752 --> 01:52:35.794
- Bloody thief!

2023
01:52:37.544 --> 01:52:39.836
Stealing once wasn't enough for you?!

2024
01:52:40.044 --> 01:52:41.169
- Shashi!

2025
01:52:41.377 --> 01:52:42.211
- Shashi!

2026
01:52:42.836 --> 01:52:44.461
- Shashi come quick!

2027
01:52:46.419 --> 01:52:48.752
I was trying to help you...

2028
01:52:50.502 --> 01:52:51.336
- Liar!

2029
01:52:51.377 --> 01:52:53.044
Why do you think your agent's
been trying to get in touch?!


2030
01:52:53.127 --> 01:52:54.544
Ma, he was stealing again!
You know it!


2031
01:52:54.627 --> 01:52:56.752
No! No!
It's not his fault!


2032
01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:59.336
I was the one
who gave him your story!

2033
01:53:27.211 --> 01:53:31.461
Rahul had been trying
to write for ages...


2034
01:53:32.836 --> 01:53:35.169
- He was stuck...
- What about me, Ma?!


2035
01:53:35.336 --> 01:53:39.711
Arjun... I thought you weren't
serious about anything...


2036
01:53:40.711 --> 01:53:42.461
You quit college in 6 months...

2037
01:53:43.127 --> 01:53:46.461
Then adventure sports, photography...

2038
01:53:47.294 --> 01:53:48.711
You had abandoned that book too?
Hadn't you?


2039
01:53:48.794 --> 01:53:50.961
So you gave my story to Rahul!

2040
01:53:51.044 --> 01:53:52.211
I just thought...

2041
01:53:52.294 --> 01:53:55.752
Thought what, Ma?!
Like you ever think about me!


2042
01:53:56.794 --> 01:53:59.627
Do you know why I'm always
taking up new things?!


2043
01:54:00.336 --> 01:54:02.294
I wanted to prove myself!

2044
01:54:02.377 --> 01:54:05.502
I wanted to do something
to make you feel proud!


2045
01:54:06.127 --> 01:54:08.586
And today,
you've snatched that from me!


2046
01:54:09.086 --> 01:54:10.211
I'm sorry...

2047
01:54:11.544 --> 01:54:13.669
I should never have
given him your story...


2048
01:54:13.836 --> 01:54:17.294
Morn, this isn't about
the goddamn story!


2049
01:54:17.627 --> 01:54:20.377
It's about you and me!! It's about what
you made me feel all these years...


2050
01:54:20.419 --> 01:54:22.086
...that I'm just not good enough.

2051
01:54:22.252 --> 01:54:23.377
No, my darling...

2052
01:54:23.461 --> 01:54:25.127
Rahul was always better than me!

2053
01:54:25.377 --> 01:54:27.961
- I'm sorry...
- Sorry?!


2054
01:54:29.294 --> 01:54:32.294
Sorry won't fix this, Ma...
Sorry won't fix anything.


2055
01:54:32.377 --> 01:54:33.627
Arjun, no!

2056
01:54:33.711 --> 01:54:35.794
Arjun! Listen, please!

2057
01:58:36.377 --> 01:58:39.002
Arjun sir... Your bags are packed.

2058
01:58:39.169 --> 01:58:41.502
The taxi will be here at 5 am.

2059
01:58:46.544 --> 01:58:48.377
I'm not hungry...

2060
01:58:49.961 --> 01:58:51.502
You'll eat...

2061
01:58:56.919 --> 01:58:58.294
Arjun, please...

2062
01:59:00.169 --> 01:59:02.002
Stay back a few days...

2063
01:59:03.752 --> 01:59:05.711
Morn needs us.

2064
01:59:07.794 --> 01:59:10.711
She doesn't need us... she needs you.

2065
01:59:17.794 --> 01:59:20.002
She's not even speaking to me.

2066
01:59:24.211 --> 01:59:25.919
Who knows if she ever will.

2067
01:59:26.169 --> 01:59:30.586
Please, Rahul... There's nothing
you can do to make Morn that angry.


2068
01:59:34.836 --> 01:59:36.127
If only.

2069
01:59:40.294 --> 01:59:44.752
Arjun... There's something
I've been lying about my entire life.


2070
01:59:46.627 --> 01:59:48.877
I don't have a girlfriend in London.

2071
01:59:54.711 --> 01:59:59.377
As for Tia... or Geet...
or any girl for that matter...


2072
01:59:59.586 --> 02:00:02.794
I've never been interested...

2073
02:00:03.961 --> 02:00:05.502
...and never will be.

2074
02:00:09.752 --> 02:00:13.419
My whole life has been a lie... and...

2075
02:00:15.836 --> 02:00:19.294
No one in this house
will ever accept the truth.


2076
02:00:27.877 --> 02:00:29.919
I... I don't know what to say.

2077
02:00:31.919 --> 02:00:33.294
It's alright.

2078
02:00:33.627 --> 02:00:35.669
You don't have to say anything.

2079
02:00:38.711 --> 02:00:42.752
All I'm asking is that
you stay back for a while.


2080
02:00:48.836 --> 02:00:50.461
That's something I can't do!

2081
02:00:56.252 --> 02:00:58.169
I... I need some time.

2082
02:01:28.627 --> 02:01:29.961
- So has he read the new draft?

2083
02:01:30.127 --> 02:01:32.002
He's been expecting you!

2084
02:01:35.502 --> 02:01:36.586
Thank you.

2085
02:01:36.919 --> 02:01:38.544
- Hey, Arjun... Edward.
- Hi.


2086
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:39.752
Have a seat.

2087
02:01:40.461 --> 02:01:42.419
So. Loved the new draft.

2088
02:01:43.461 --> 02:01:45.877
Congratulations.
We're going ahead with it.


2089
02:01:48.294 --> 02:01:49.252
Thank you.

2090
02:01:50.419 --> 02:01:52.127
The new ending's great!

2091
02:01:52.294 --> 02:01:54.211
What made you decide to change it?

2092
02:01:56.836 --> 02:01:58.961
Just a good suggestion from someone.

2093
02:03:02.169 --> 02:03:03.461
Hello, kids...

2094
02:03:03.544 --> 02:03:04.752
How are you?

2095
02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:06.294
- I'm fine.

2096
02:03:07.002 --> 02:03:08.836
It's just that...

2097
02:03:09.627 --> 02:03:13.419
I got tired of watching
Mandakini's videos.


2098
02:03:13.544 --> 02:03:15.877
So I thought I'd talk to you guys...

2099
02:03:18.377 --> 02:03:20.711
I really miss you both.

2100
02:03:22.294 --> 02:03:24.044
After Harsh...

2101
02:03:25.086 --> 02:03:27.211
- It's difficult to
find the will to live.


2102
02:03:28.627 --> 02:03:31.877
Otherwise I was all
set for my century...


2103
02:03:32.877 --> 02:03:34.877
Now it's too hard...

2104
02:03:35.627 --> 02:03:37.627
I feel very alone...

2105
02:03:39.294 --> 02:03:42.086
Sometimes I look at
your father's pictures and...


2106
02:03:54.586 --> 02:03:58.336
You'll should call
your mother sometimes...


2107
02:03:58.877 --> 02:04:03.794
She acts like she's very strong...

2108
02:04:05.127 --> 02:04:08.836
But I hear her crying every night.

2109
02:04:10.086 --> 02:04:11.502
- Every night.

2110
02:04:12.627 --> 02:04:18.419
I'm asking you'll for
the one thing I don't have...


2111
02:04:19.419 --> 02:04:21.919
Just a little... Time.

2112
02:04:23.211 --> 02:04:25.627
Everyone makes mistakes, kids...

2113
02:04:26.419 --> 02:04:29.252
- But we don't abandon our families.

2114
02:04:30.794 --> 02:04:32.669
Consider this an old man's request...

2115
02:04:32.752 --> 02:04:36.544
Once... just once... Come back.

2116
02:04:37.086 --> 02:04:40.961
After that... who knows
if you'll need to.


2117
02:04:44.502 --> 02:04:45.336
<i>Bye..bye...</i>

2118
02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.044
- Hi Shashi Uncle...

2119
02:05:12.294 --> 02:05:13.461
Hi Zoey!

2120
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:14.669
- Flight was okay?
- Hi...


2121
02:05:14.752 --> 02:05:16.752
- How are you?
- Good, good...


2122
02:05:27.919 --> 02:05:29.294
Come with me!

2123
02:05:29.502 --> 02:05:31.544
- See my new book!
- Hi, Ma.


2124
02:05:38.794 --> 02:05:40.086
Thank you...

2125
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:42.086
Thank you for coming...

2126
02:05:42.461 --> 02:05:44.961
- Hi, Dadu...
- I'm so happy to see you'll...


2127
02:05:46.127 --> 02:05:49.169
- You rest, Dadu...
- We'll see you in the morning.


2128
02:05:49.377 --> 02:05:51.336
Do me a favour...

2129
02:05:52.627 --> 02:05:54.961
Another small request...

2130
02:05:55.502 --> 02:05:59.919
Bring the whole family to me tomorrow...

2131
02:06:04.961 --> 02:06:06.752
God bless you both...

2132
02:06:16.002 --> 02:06:17.127
Rahul?

2133
02:06:17.377 --> 02:06:18.627
Come in, Ma...

2134
02:06:19.502 --> 02:06:21.252
Just dropping these off...

2135
02:06:22.669 --> 02:06:24.961
Dharmendra forgot to keep them...

2136
02:06:35.377 --> 02:06:36.419
I'll get you a glass...

2137
02:06:36.502 --> 02:06:37.961
<i>-</i> Ma?
<i>-</i> Yes?


2138
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:41.752
Sit with me...

2139
02:06:59.836 --> 02:07:01.169
How are you?

2140
02:07:02.377 --> 02:07:03.669
I'm fine...

2141
02:07:05.169 --> 02:07:06.252
Busy...

2142
02:07:07.919 --> 02:07:09.002
I'm fine.

2143
02:07:13.919 --> 02:07:15.002
Are you okay?

2144
02:07:15.086 --> 02:07:17.419
Yes... I'm fine.

2145
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:21.752
And... How's...

2146
02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:29.461
Your... friend?

2147
02:07:42.419 --> 02:07:43.586
It's okay.

2148
02:07:45.336 --> 02:07:47.044
I missed you.

2149
02:07:47.752 --> 02:07:49.044
I'm sorry.

2150
02:07:56.586 --> 02:07:58.211
I didn't think you'd come.

2151
02:07:59.419 --> 02:08:01.169
I didn't think you'd call.

2152
02:08:05.294 --> 02:08:09.294
You know, Tia... When you
told me about your family...


2153
02:08:12.252 --> 02:08:14.294
I could understand your pain...

2154
02:08:17.336 --> 02:08:18.877
But now... I can feel it.

2155
02:08:20.294 --> 02:08:21.752
I know how you feel, Arjun.

2156
02:08:31.752 --> 02:08:34.252
I'm tired of running away...
that's all I've ever done.


2157
02:08:34.586 --> 02:08:35.836
Then come back...

2158
02:08:38.211 --> 02:08:39.877
Everyone's here...

2159
02:08:40.586 --> 02:08:42.044
They always were.

2160
02:08:47.836 --> 02:08:49.169
I missed you.
