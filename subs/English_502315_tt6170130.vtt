[Narrator] When
The Beatles burst


10
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.612
onto the world stage in 1963,

11
00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:57.074
they transformed
popular music overnight.


12
00:00:57.116 --> 00:00:59.743
A commercial phenomenon
like no other,


13
00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:01.870
they paved the way
for every artist


14
00:01:01.912 --> 00:01:03.747
who followed in their wake.

15
00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.668
They were selling
vast amounts of records,


16
00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.795
a quarter of a million a week.

17
00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.463
No one had ever
done that before.


18
00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.758
Even Elvis hadn't,
Lonnie Donegan hadn't.


19
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.095
Every week selling a quarter
of a million records.


20
00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:22.390
You had a revolution,
just in terms of sales.


21
00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:23.892
But in addition to that,

22
00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:25.811
we wouldn't have had
The Rolling Stones.


23
00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:27.479
You wouldn't have The Byrds,

24
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.439
you wouldn't have had
Dylan going electric.


25
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:31.025
You wouldn't have had The Doors,

26
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:35.236
and all those other bands
we associate with the 60s.


27
00:01:35.278 --> 00:01:37.072
The chances of them existing

28
00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:40.199
without The Beatles
are pretty slim.


29
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:43.954
[Narrator] Yet the band's
impact spread far beyond music.


30
00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:46.289
As figureheads for
a blooming youth culture,


31
00:01:46.331 --> 00:01:48.083
their influence
penetrated to the heart


32
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:49.751
of the post-war world.

33
00:01:49.793 --> 00:01:52.046
[Mark] They were
agents of change.


34
00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:53.839
They were carrying
everyone with them.


35
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:58.010
Everything felt modern, new,
fresh, everywhere you looked.


36
00:01:58.052 --> 00:01:59.553
The world started
to look different.


37
00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:02.056
[Mark] The colors
started to really emerge,


38
00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:05.225
the green shoots
of a new culture.


39
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.895
From the point of
The Beatles' arrival,


40
00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:10.397
they completely reinvented
how culture works.


41
00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:13.817
Suddenly, adults were
growing their hair long.


42
00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.112
Grown-up women were
wearing mini-skirts.


43
00:02:17.154 --> 00:02:20.657
Suddenly, it was young people
who were determining everything.


44
00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.910
That started with The Beatles.

45
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.745
[Narrator] By the
second half of the '60s,


46
00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:26.205
the band transformed

47
00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:28.790
into leaders of the
emerging counterculture.


48
00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:32.169
Bringing new social,
sexual and artistic ideas


49
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.214
into the mainstream, through
their peaceful revolution


50
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:39.426
they became the undisputed
voice of a generation.


51
00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:42.303
The Beatles were the most
commercial band on earth.


52
00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:45.265
But they were also the most
avant-garde and experimental.


53
00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:47.101
That was their role.

54
00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:48.643
Through their music, they
opened up peoples' minds.


55
00:02:48.685 --> 00:02:51.438
They helped to
move a lot of people


56
00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.148
who might not otherwise
have gone along


57
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.818
with the stuff that happened
in '66, '67 and '68.


58
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.822
They were inspirational and
influential in that way.


59
00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:04.659
But as they became more
involved in the counterculture


60
00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:06.203
and more representative of it,

61
00:03:06.245 --> 00:03:09.164
they became a political threat.

through the most extraordinary
decade of the 20th century.

It reveals the lasting impact

of four musicians
from Liverpool,


66
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.927
who went from class warriors
to cultural revolutionaries,


67
00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.639
while providing the
soundtrack for a generation.


68
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.682
They were catalysts
for a great many things.

about everything.

Great Britain, 1962.

A small and once
dominant Kingdom,

finally recovering
from years of austerity

A nation of
discipline and order,

of industrial cities and
quiet village greens.

And although outwardly it
appeared stuck in the past,


78
00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:05.679
beneath the surface a fresh
culture was developing


79
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.889

by some of the coldest
weather it had ever suffered,

quickly rose to number
two on the British charts,

a kind of eruption.


100
00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:21.922
They took the blunt force
of 1950s rock and roll,


101
00:05:21.963 --> 00:05:23.298
which was a blunt instrument,

there's no other
way to describe it.


103

Musically and socially,
it was a blunt instrument.


104
00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.055
And they grafted on
to that the harmonies

and the whole plaintive vocal
quality of the girl groups

Nobody had ever heard anything
quite like this before.

This was a group that had

I don't think had
really happened before.


112

The sound of John Lennon and
Paul McCartney singing together


113
00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:57.124

They were a shock
to the system.


117
00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:13.807
Love Me Do was the first single,

118
00:06:13.848 --> 00:06:15.434
and it was a bit
of a false start.

Please Please Me is when
you had

the unison sound of the band.

They're singing,
"Come on, come on."

There's this sense
of anticipation

and a sense of excitement.

124
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.112
It was a fresh sound.

125
00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:28.905
It sounds so traditional now.

126
00:06:28.947 --> 00:06:30.282
But at the time,

127
00:06:30.324 --> 00:06:32.909
the look and the sound
was completely fresh.


128

George Harrison
and Ringo Starr...


131
00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:45.005
provided a much needed
shot in the arm


132
00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:47.132
to Britain's pop scene.

133
00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.926
Although American rock and roll
had been enormously popular


134
00:06:49.968 --> 00:06:51.510
in the mid 1950s,

135
00:06:51.552 --> 00:06:55.015
its electrifying initial
surge proved short-lived.


136
00:06:55.056 --> 00:06:57.809
With its major stars
either selling out


137
00:06:57.851 --> 00:06:59.560
or disappearing from the scene,

138
00:06:59.602 --> 00:07:02.481
the musicians that came in
their wake were more wholesome


139
00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:04.858
and less threatening.

140
00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:07.277
British artists followed suit,

141
00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.154
and the musical
landscape in the UK


142
00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:11.198
was dominated by
talented imitators


143
00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.951
and the teen idols of pop
Svengali Larry Parnes.


144
00:07:14.993 --> 00:07:17.704
With the support of their
manager Brian Epstein


145
00:07:17.745 --> 00:07:19.664
and producer George Martin,

146
00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:22.292
The Beatles offered
something very different.


147
00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:24.919
Driven by the unique
songwriting partnership


148
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:26.796
of John Lennon and
Paul McCartney,


149
00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:29.924
this band composed
their own material.


150
00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.260
Most of conventional
English show business,


151
00:07:32.302 --> 00:07:33.887
as we think of it,

152
00:07:33.928 --> 00:07:36.515
was really a pale reflection
of American show business.


153
00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.183
It had not always been the case.

154

But since the war,
certainly it was.


155
00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:41.978
You had singers like Matt Monro

156
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.524
who did an almost letter perfect
imitation of Frank Sinatra.


157
00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:47.108
By the same token,

158
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.237
you had the famous facile,
fatuous English pop stars


159
00:07:50.278 --> 00:07:51.738
of the period,

160
00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:53.990
of whom Cliff Richard
was by far the best known


161
00:07:54.032 --> 00:07:55.534
and the most successful,

162
00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.912
who was a kind of third-rate
version of Elvis.


163
00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:02.040
And not of the Elvis
of Heartbreak Hotel


164
00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:04.125
but of the Elvis of King Creole,

165
00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:06.294
the Elvis of Elvis
the movie star.


166
00:08:06.336 --> 00:08:09.464
["Summer Holiday"]

167

172
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:29.150
It was pretty professional.

173
00:08:29.192 --> 00:08:31.528
Cliff Richard and The
Shadows were good players.


174
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.154
It was a good act.

175
00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:34.864
But it was family friendly.

176
00:08:34.906 --> 00:08:38.201
And you had also characters
like Larry Parnes,


177
00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:42.997
with his stable of pretty boys
who did what they were told,


178
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.417
who sung what they
were told to sing,


179
00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:48.878
and who had no particular
creative input at all.


180
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.131
So when somebody like
The Beatles comes along


181
00:08:51.172 --> 00:08:52.799
and they're not only

182
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.968
playing their own instruments,
singing beautifully,


183
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:56.595
they're also singing
their own compositions,


184
00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.597
this was incredibly
rare at the time.


185
00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:01.724
The Beatles were
keen from the start


186
00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:03.226
to write their own material.

187
00:09:03.268 --> 00:09:05.186
They wrote the songs
to the audience,


188
00:09:05.228 --> 00:09:06.813
to address the audience.

189
00:09:06.854 --> 00:09:10.233
They knew that the audience
was 80% teenage girls


190
00:09:10.275 --> 00:09:11.692
and they wrote songs

191
00:09:11.734 --> 00:09:13.320
that elicited the perfect
response from them.


192
00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:16.239
And after that,
the deluge followed.


193
00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:18.533
It sent the signal out
to everybody


194
00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:21.328
that you can all
write your own song,


195
00:09:21.369 --> 00:09:22.954
get a slice of the action.

196
00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.624
Within a year or two,
all bands were writing,


197
00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.292
or having a crack at it.

198
00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.419
[Narrator] It wasn't only
the extraordinary sound


199
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:31.963
of The Beatles or the unique
talents of Lennon and McCartney


200
00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:35.091
that were revolutionizing
popular music.


201
00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:38.512
As they came to dominate
the charts in 1963,


202
00:09:38.553 --> 00:09:40.138
their string of hit records

203
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.098
transformed the
commercial fortunes


204
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.601
of the British record
industry itself.


205
00:09:44.643 --> 00:09:47.145
As The Beatles
became more popular,


206
00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:50.398
and every record seemed
to sell more and more,


207
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.028
you had a revolution in the
British record industry,


208
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:56.904
just in terms of sales.

209
00:09:56.946 --> 00:09:59.699
They'd never seen
anything like this,


210
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.284
both in the amount of sales

211
00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:03.411
and the how long
The Beatles would hang around


212
00:10:03.453 --> 00:10:06.789
in the charts, for months
and months and months.


213
00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:08.542
In addition to that,

214
00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:13.796
there was the rolling impact
of hit after hit after hit,


215
00:10:13.838 --> 00:10:16.299
that never let the quality drop.

216
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:18.718
If anything, the
quality increased,


217
00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:21.971
from Please Please
Me to From Me to You,


218
00:10:22.013 --> 00:10:25.850
which was a little more
downbeat but was no less wily.


219
00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:28.936
And then between the eyes:
She Loves You,


220
00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:32.940
which explodes out of
the radio to this day.


221
00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:35.902
♪ She loves you,
yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

226
00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:55.296
People like Cliff
and Billy Fury and Elvis,


227
00:10:55.338 --> 00:10:58.508
they were selling quite
substantial amounts of


228
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:03.638
records per se, but
by the beginning of 1963


229
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.891
when Please Please Me
and From Me to You


230
00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:08.560
and the Please Please Me
album,


231
00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:12.146
they were selling vast
amounts of records.


232
00:11:12.188 --> 00:11:14.190
No one had seen
anything like this


233
00:11:14.232 --> 00:11:15.567
in the pop industry before.

234
00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:17.776
This was suddenly a
happening industry


235
00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:20.572
that not only young people
were taking notice of it,


236
00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:22.574
but the bean counters too.

237
00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:26.327
So you had everyone scouring
Birmingham for The Moody Blues,


238
00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:28.162
The Hollies in Manchester.

239
00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:29.872
And Liverpool of course,

240
00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:31.541
all the scouts were up there
looking for the next Beatles.


241
00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:33.167
Everyone wanted a
slice of the action


242
00:11:33.209 --> 00:11:36.421
because they'd revolutionized
the music industry


243
00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:39.048
in just a matter
of months in 1963.


244
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.468
[Narrator] But
the group's impact


245
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:44.387
was not merely confined
to the musical world.


246
00:11:44.429 --> 00:11:48.266
They also both represented
and inspired a seismic shift


247
00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:51.519
at the very heart
of British society.


248
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:54.522
How these four young
working class Liverpudlians


249
00:11:54.564 --> 00:11:56.733
managed to spearhead
such a change


250
00:11:56.775 --> 00:12:00.361
lie in The Beatles, '
and the country's, past.


251
00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:06.951
In the two centuries before
the Second World War,


252
00:12:06.993 --> 00:12:09.496
the United Kingdom had led
the Industrial Revolution


253
00:12:09.537 --> 00:12:12.415
and had ruled over the
greatest Empire on earth.


254
00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:15.168
One of the foundations
behind this superpower


255
00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:16.877
was its class system,

256
00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:20.173
which both divided and
ordered its citizens.


257
00:12:20.214 --> 00:12:24.051
After emerging victorious
from war in 1945,


258
00:12:24.093 --> 00:12:25.886
the elite class in this system,

259
00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:29.140
known as the Establishment,
which included the monarchy,


260
00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:30.767
the aristocracy, and the heads

261
00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:33.603
of all the major institutions
governing society,


262
00:12:33.645 --> 00:12:35.938
immediately tried to
reinforce their power,


263
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.525
and this chain of
command would once again


264
00:12:38.566 --> 00:12:41.860
shape life in Britain
during the post-war years.


265
00:12:41.902 --> 00:12:45.239
Britain was a very
class-ridden society.


266
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:48.201
We were a nation of
subjects, not citizens.


267
00:12:48.242 --> 00:12:51.954
And as long as you do
have a royal family


268
00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:53.832
and a set of lords and ladies,

269
00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:56.584
the whole hierarchy
of privilege,


270
00:12:56.626 --> 00:12:59.128
then obviously someone's
going to be at the bottom.


271
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.755
After the war,

272
00:13:00.797 --> 00:13:03.007
the Establishment obviously
tried to reassert itself.


273
00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:06.302
So you still had the old
Christian values, for instance.


274
00:13:06.344 --> 00:13:08.887
Nothing happened on a Sunday.

275
00:13:08.929 --> 00:13:11.599
Even children's
swings in the parks


276
00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:13.309
were chained up on Sundays.

277
00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:15.228
The '60s really
was the first time


278
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:17.689
that anyone kicked a hole
in any of that


279
00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:19.566
and started to challenge all

280
00:13:19.607 --> 00:13:21.442
of these traditional
assumptions.


281
00:13:21.484 --> 00:13:25.405
Really, it was the same
group of middle class people,


282
00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:28.449
who assumed they had the right
to tell everybody how to live,


283
00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:30.869
were still very much in power.

284
00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:33.162
[Narrator] Yet
Britain's power was waning


285
00:13:33.204 --> 00:13:36.123
and its empire slowly crumbling.

286
00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:39.168
Almost bankrupt as a result
of its war effort,


287
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.128
the years of hardship
that followed


288
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.715
saw the entire country suffer.

289
00:13:43.757 --> 00:13:46.342
The North of England in
particular struggled to recover,


290
00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:49.345
and the once dominant
port city of Liverpool,


291
00:13:49.387 --> 00:13:51.723
heavily targeted by
German air raids,


292
00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:55.976
was beset by widespread damage
and disappearing industry.


293
00:13:56.018 --> 00:13:58.062
During the 19th century,

294
00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:01.816
the North developed this
proud sense of itself.


295
00:14:01.858 --> 00:14:05.027
The port of Liverpool was the
greatest port in the world


296
00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:07.447
because England was the
greatest commercial nation


297
00:14:07.488 --> 00:14:11.284
in the world and most things
came in and out there.


298
00:14:11.325 --> 00:14:13.870
But over the course
of the 20th century,


299
00:14:13.912 --> 00:14:16.497
England went through
a phenomenon that


300
00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:18.165
is now very familiar

301
00:14:18.207 --> 00:14:20.794
to Americans of the
late 20th century,


302
00:14:20.835 --> 00:14:23.922
which is the decline
of industrialization,


303
00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.339
the decline of manufacturing.

304
00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:27.926
By the 1940s, it was very clear

305
00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:31.011
that Liverpool was in decline.

306
00:14:31.053 --> 00:14:34.265
As a result, The Beatles'
generation grew up in this place


307
00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:37.310
that was filled with the
emblems of imperial might


308
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:40.897
but which was becoming a
very dire place to live


309
00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:42.565
in many ways.

310
00:14:42.607 --> 00:14:43.983
Everywhere there was a debris.

311
00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:46.861
The streets were full
of bombed buildings.


312
00:14:46.903 --> 00:14:48.279
All the kids used to play

313
00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:50.448
in the buildings
and deserted places.


314
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.701
The debris was still going

315
00:14:53.743 --> 00:14:57.872
There was no money about,
and it was very hard.


316
00:14:57.914 --> 00:15:02.543
What did young people have in
Liverpool to look forward to?


317
00:15:02.585 --> 00:15:04.337
Everything was closing down.

318
00:15:04.378 --> 00:15:06.422
All the factories
were closing down.


319
00:15:06.464 --> 00:15:11.719
It was pretty tough times
in Liverpool in those days.


320
00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:14.931
[Narrator] And it was
within this stark landscape


321
00:15:14.973 --> 00:15:16.891
that The Beatles grew up.

322
00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:20.019
The band's founder and
eldest member, John Lennon,


323
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.729
was the product of a broken home

324
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:23.773
and was raised by
his aunt and uncle


325
00:15:23.815 --> 00:15:26.233
in a fairly affluent
area of the city.


326
00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:27.694
His future bandmates,

327
00:15:27.735 --> 00:15:29.612
Paul McCartney and
George Harrison, however,


328
00:15:29.654 --> 00:15:32.281
both came from working
class neighborhoods.


329
00:15:32.323 --> 00:15:34.575
Despite the dereliction
surrounding them


330
00:15:34.617 --> 00:15:36.661
and the hard times in
which they were raised,


331
00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:39.873
the future prospects of all
three were given a boost


332
00:15:39.914 --> 00:15:42.082
by a new educational initiative

333
00:15:42.124 --> 00:15:45.003
that saw the brightest children
enrolled in grammar schools,


334
00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:48.006
whatever their
financial background.


335
00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:51.050
John Lennon, Paul
McCartney and George Harrison


336
00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:54.053
took an examination when
they were 11 years old


337
00:15:54.094 --> 00:15:56.973
that essentially
certified them as clever.


338
00:15:57.015 --> 00:16:00.643
And as a result of passing
what was called the 11+ exam,


339
00:16:00.685 --> 00:16:03.730
that meant they were eligible
to go to grammar schools.


340
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:06.399
Grammar schools were
designed to educate children


341
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.402
in order to go on to some
form of higher education.


342
00:16:09.443 --> 00:16:12.947
What this meant was that
at a relatively early age,


343
00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:14.699
at the age of 11,

344
00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:16.868
particularly Paul McCartney
and George Harrison,


345
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.078
whose origins were
truly working class.


346
00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:21.163
John Lennon was a
bit more complicated.


347
00:16:21.205 --> 00:16:23.249
John was a little
betwixt and between.


348
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.419
But in the case of both Paul
McCartney and George Harrison,


349
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.255
at the age of 11, they
were somewhat isolated


350
00:16:29.296 --> 00:16:32.842
from the world of
the housing estates


351
00:16:32.884 --> 00:16:34.510
that they had grown up on.

352
00:16:34.552 --> 00:16:37.179
Every day they took the bus
into the center of Liverpool


353
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:40.099
to go to a place called
the Liverpool Institute


354
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.810
and they were essentially marked

355
00:16:42.852 --> 00:16:44.645
and educated from the age of 11

356
00:16:44.687 --> 00:16:46.856
to transcend their
working class origins.


357
00:16:46.898 --> 00:16:49.943
[Narrator] With far better
schooling than their parents,


358
00:16:49.984 --> 00:16:52.486
these future Beatles
were a new breed,


359
00:16:52.528 --> 00:16:55.073
raised within the proud
Liverpudlian working class,


360
00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:59.035
yet unfazed by the educated
elites supposedly above them.


361
00:16:59.077 --> 00:17:02.080
And with the coming of
rock and roll in 1956,


362
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:06.166
a musical form exploded that
spoke directly to their youth


363
00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:08.252
and their sense of difference.

364
00:17:08.294 --> 00:17:09.629
It was the following year

365
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.297
that John Lennon
met Paul McCartney


366
00:17:11.338 --> 00:17:14.216
and invited him to join
his band The Quarrymen,


367
00:17:14.258 --> 00:17:17.511
with George Harrison
joining shortly thereafter.


368
00:17:17.553 --> 00:17:19.597
All around them in Liverpool

369
00:17:19.639 --> 00:17:22.683
a new phenomenon was finding
its own rebellious voice:


370
00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:25.352
the teenagers had arrived.

371
00:17:25.394 --> 00:17:29.315
The '50s became the era

372
00:17:29.356 --> 00:17:32.610
when teenagers really
came into their own.


373
00:17:32.652 --> 00:17:35.655
We were together in
our love of the music.


374
00:17:35.696 --> 00:17:40.618
Up until that time a young
lad would be taken to the pub


375
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.913
for his first pint, when he
turned of age, by his dad.


376
00:17:43.955 --> 00:17:45.999
He'd dress like his dad.

377
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.126
He'd go into the
union of his dad


378
00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:50.336
and he'd go in the
same work as his dad.


379
00:17:50.377 --> 00:17:52.630
With the girls, she
was in the kitchen


380
00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:54.882
learning how to
make the breakfast,


381
00:17:54.924 --> 00:17:56.550
do the cleaning,
all the rest of it.


382
00:17:56.592 --> 00:18:00.013
But suddenly the youngsters
were now earning money


383
00:18:00.054 --> 00:18:02.682
and they wanted to
spend it their way


384
00:18:02.723 --> 00:18:06.185
and do their things and
not be told what to do.


385
00:18:06.226 --> 00:18:08.813
[Narrator] A generation
gap was opening up


386
00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:11.482
and this would dominate
cultural life in Britain


387
00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:13.067
across the next decade.

388
00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:14.568
And while rock and roll
resonated


389
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.821
with young working
class Britons,


390
00:18:16.863 --> 00:18:18.364
other American influences,

391
00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:20.741
from the Beat poets
to jazz and blues,


392
00:18:20.783 --> 00:18:23.410
were embraced by
middle class teenagers.


393
00:18:23.452 --> 00:18:26.539
If the future Beatles were at
heart rock and roll rebels,


394
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.876
none of them more embodied
this than John Lennon.


395
00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:32.962
But having failed
his exams in 1957,


396
00:18:33.004 --> 00:18:35.673
he found a place at the
Liverpool College of Art,


397
00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:38.051
where he was thrown
into an unfamiliar,


398
00:18:38.092 --> 00:18:39.760
Bohemian student culture.

399
00:18:39.802 --> 00:18:43.181
Although this would prove
vital in expanding his talents,


400
00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:45.808
here Lennon was an outsider.

401
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.394
I first met John Lennon
at the College of Art.


402
00:18:48.435 --> 00:18:51.605
I was sitting down
in the canteen.


403
00:18:51.647 --> 00:18:54.984
Suddenly I noticed
this guy walk past.


404
00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:58.612
And I thought, what's
he dressed up like?


405
00:18:58.654 --> 00:19:01.490
He was dressed almost
like a teddy boy,


406
00:19:01.532 --> 00:19:05.119
in a completely
unconventional type of dress


407
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:06.954
compared to all
the other students.


408
00:19:06.996 --> 00:19:10.124
I looked round and everyone
was wearing duffle coats


409
00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.667
and turtleneck sweaters.

410
00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:14.212
I thought, oh, they're
all wearing the same,


411
00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:16.005
they're all conventional.

412
00:19:16.047 --> 00:19:18.632
He's the rebel.
He's the one who's different.


413
00:19:18.674 --> 00:19:19.884
I must get to know him.

414
00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:28.226
If you were in art
school in the 1950s


415
00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:29.936
you would have been exposed

416
00:19:29.977 --> 00:19:33.564
to the intellectual radicalism
and rebellion of figures


417
00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:37.359
like Jack Kerouac and
the Beat generation


418
00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:42.448
who were anti-established
religion, pro self-expression


419
00:19:42.489 --> 00:19:45.785
anti any kind of
Establishment repression.


420
00:19:45.826 --> 00:19:48.328
And the angry young men
of theater,


421
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.664
John Osborne, Arnold Wesker...

422
00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:54.210
these guys were angry,
but they were clever.


423
00:19:54.252 --> 00:19:57.463
They found a way of
directing their anger,


424
00:19:57.504 --> 00:19:59.632
which may well have
been a personal angst,


425
00:19:59.673 --> 00:20:02.593
but when it's directed
to the outside world


426
00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:07.556
it can create a great articulate
voice of a generation,


427
00:20:07.598 --> 00:20:09.308
if you like.

428
00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:12.270
[Man]
Nine hundred and fifty-four...


429
00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:17.524
nine hundred
and fifty-bloody-five,


430
00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:21.195
I could get through in half
the time if I went like a bull,


431
00:20:21.237 --> 00:20:23.906
but they'd only slash me wages,
so they can get stuffed.


432
00:20:27.076 --> 00:20:29.245
Don't let the bastards
grind you down,


433
00:20:29.287 --> 00:20:31.205
that's one thing I've learned.

434
00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:34.875
This sort of influence
would have been very appealing


435
00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:36.836
to someone like John Lennon

436
00:20:36.877 --> 00:20:39.379
who was himself an
angry young man,


437
00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:41.423
for all kinds of
personal reasons.


438
00:20:41.465 --> 00:20:43.092
But if you could be
an angry young man


439
00:20:43.134 --> 00:20:46.595
and thoughtful with it,
then that's very appealing.


440
00:20:46.637 --> 00:20:49.265
[Narrator] By
the summer of 1960,


441
00:20:49.307 --> 00:20:50.766
the school days of John Lennon,

442
00:20:50.808 --> 00:20:53.311
Paul McCartney and George
Harrison were over.


443
00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:54.728
Yet they were quickly thrust

444
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.148
into an education
of another kind.


445
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.567
In August, the band, now
calling itself The Beatles,


446
00:21:00.609 --> 00:21:02.111
headed for a season of shows

447
00:21:02.153 --> 00:21:03.904
in the vibrant
German city Hamburg,


448
00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:06.032
and over the following year

449
00:21:06.073 --> 00:21:08.034
it was here that they
earned their stripes


450
00:21:08.075 --> 00:21:09.743
as a rock and roll band.

451
00:21:09.785 --> 00:21:12.663
Upon their return to
Liverpool in 1961,


452
00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:16.209
they quickly rose to the very
top of the city's music scene.


453
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.627
Yet they were
isolated in the North,


454
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:21.380
and the rest of the country
paid little attention.


455
00:21:21.421 --> 00:21:24.675
I started writing to
papers like The Daily Mail


456
00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:26.677
saying what is
happening in Liverpool


457
00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:29.596
is like New Orleans at
the turn of the century,


458
00:21:29.638 --> 00:21:32.141
but with rock and roll
instead of jazz.


459
00:21:32.183 --> 00:21:34.143
Of course, no one
was interested.


460
00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:38.981
So I decided to do it myself
and created Mersey Beat


461
00:21:39.023 --> 00:21:42.193
and of course my friends,

462
00:21:42.235 --> 00:21:45.571
John and the group he
formed, The Beatles,


463
00:21:45.612 --> 00:21:47.740
were the main people
I wrote about.


464
00:21:47.781 --> 00:21:51.118
[Narrator] With a teenage
audience hungry for information


465
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.204
about this new rock
and roll scene,


466
00:21:53.246 --> 00:21:56.665
Bill Harry's Mersey Beat music
paper proved a huge success


467
00:21:56.707 --> 00:21:58.334
in the North of England.

468
00:21:58.376 --> 00:22:00.878
Celebrating The Beatles
in almost every issue,


469
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.839
it brought them to the attention
of one of its contributors,


470
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:06.717
local businessman Brian Epstein.

471
00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:09.220
The manager of a
Liverpool music store,


472
00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:12.265
through Bill Harry, Epstein
arranged to see the band play


473
00:22:12.306 --> 00:22:14.392
at the city's
legendary Cavern Club


474
00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.977
and was blown away
by their performance.


475
00:22:17.019 --> 00:22:19.313
He immediately offered
to manage the band


476
00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:23.734
and by January 1962,
a contract was signed.


477
00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:27.445
Wary of the controlling approach
of managers like Larry Parnes,


478
00:22:27.487 --> 00:22:30.657
Epstein was still conscious
of the unwritten rules


479
00:22:30.699 --> 00:22:32.659
of the British
entertainment industry.


480
00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:35.037
If The Beatles were going
to change the world,


481
00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:37.998
they'd first have to
change their look.


482
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.001
What I think he
had was the instinct


483
00:22:41.043 --> 00:22:45.131
to realize the general
overall pattern


484
00:22:45.172 --> 00:22:48.259
of how things worked
in this country.


485
00:22:48.301 --> 00:22:50.803
They were the savage
young Beatles


486
00:22:50.844 --> 00:22:52.305
dressed in black leather

487
00:22:52.346 --> 00:22:55.557
and playing rock and
roll to prostitutes,


488
00:22:55.599 --> 00:22:57.977
gangsters and all the rest
of it in Hamburg,


489
00:22:58.018 --> 00:22:59.979
taking drugs
and all the rest of it.


490
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.814
They were the savage
young Beatles.


491
00:23:01.855 --> 00:23:04.317
They would never
have been accepted


492
00:23:04.358 --> 00:23:07.485
by the established media.

493
00:23:07.527 --> 00:23:10.448
- [piano plays]
- [female fans screaming ]


494
00:23:10.488 --> 00:23:13.451
[Narrator] And The Beatles'
breakthrough in early 1963


495
00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:17.288
confirmed that Epstein's
instincts were spot on.


496
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.874
He had successfully smuggled
a unique band of rebels


497
00:23:20.916 --> 00:23:22.918
into the heart of
the mainstream.


498
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.670
Yet unlike the
controlling managers


499
00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:27.006
that dominated the British
entertainment world,


500
00:23:27.047 --> 00:23:29.758
he then simply set them loose.

501
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.802
From the moment they
soared to the top


502
00:23:31.844 --> 00:23:33.553
of the British charts,

503
00:23:33.595 --> 00:23:35.973
the press, radio interviewers
and television presenters


504
00:23:36.015 --> 00:23:38.351
came face to face
with The Beatles,


505
00:23:38.392 --> 00:23:40.436
and these quick-witted,
confident


506
00:23:40.478 --> 00:23:41.979
and very modern young men

507
00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:45.858
chose to play the game
by their own rules.


508
00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:48.568
In the beginning, The
Beatles' behavior with the press


509
00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.322
was the most revolutionary
thing about it.


510
00:23:51.364 --> 00:23:52.823
Nobody of their age group,

511
00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:55.493
and to a certain extent,
of their background,


512
00:23:55.533 --> 00:23:58.245
had ever behaved this way
with reporters before.


513
00:23:58.287 --> 00:24:00.456
Do you know, you
look like Matt Monro?


514
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:03.709
Give us "Russia with Love."

515
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.336
[Interviewer] Thanks, boys.

516
00:24:05.378 --> 00:24:08.088
The Beatles were
just audacious.


517
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.465
When they were
being interviewed,


518
00:24:09.507 --> 00:24:11.175
they kind of turned the tables.

519
00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:13.760
When Adam Faith or someone like
that was interviewed before,


520
00:24:13.802 --> 00:24:17.681
it was very much a master
and servant kind of thing.


521
00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:19.599
Cliff, what sort
of tour did you have?


522
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:21.519
I can honestly say it's been

523
00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:23.479
probably the most pleasurable
one we've had for some time,


524
00:24:23.521 --> 00:24:26.273
mainly because, not
just the audiences,


525
00:24:26.315 --> 00:24:28.401
but because we've
had a few hours off,


526
00:24:28.442 --> 00:24:30.944
we've been swimming
and sunbathing.


527
00:24:30.986 --> 00:24:32.905
The Beatles just
ripped into that,


528
00:24:32.946 --> 00:24:35.699
and almost ridiculed
the whole thing,


529
00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:38.035
turned the whole thing
into a Marx Brothers farce,


530
00:24:38.077 --> 00:24:39.661
which was fantastic.

531
00:24:39.703 --> 00:24:42.373
I hear the four of you
are going to be millionaires


532
00:24:42.415 --> 00:24:45.251
by the end of the year.
- Oh, that's nice.


533
00:24:45.292 --> 00:24:49.922
Have you got time to
actually spend this money?


534
00:24:49.963 --> 00:24:52.383
What money? He said.

535
00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:54.592
- Doesn't he give any to you?
- No.


536
00:24:54.634 --> 00:24:56.220
Have you seen that car of his?

537
00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:57.721
[laughing]

538
00:24:57.763 --> 00:24:59.597
It was very, very
close to the way groups


539
00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:02.435
of male adolescents
interacted with one another


540
00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:03.769
as a matter of course.

541
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.272
This is what teenage boys do.

542
00:25:06.313 --> 00:25:08.107
They try to top one another.

543
00:25:08.148 --> 00:25:10.984
They try to cut one another
down, all this sort of thing.


544
00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:14.572
The Beatles simply had the
nerve to take this thing


545
00:25:14.612 --> 00:25:19.285
and to perform it in front
of microphones and cameras.


546
00:25:19.326 --> 00:25:20.953
John, we hear there's a rumor

547
00:25:20.994 --> 00:25:22.288
in The News of The Beatles paper

548
00:25:22.329 --> 00:25:23.789
that you might be
leaving the group.


549
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.417
Rubbish, I'm contracted.

550
00:25:26.459 --> 00:25:28.210
I've been trying to
get out for years.


551
00:25:28.252 --> 00:25:30.129
You've been
writing some poetry.


552
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.838
What paper?

553
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.299
[Interviewer] A paper called
The News of The Beatles.


554
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.550
- Never heard of it.
- Do you want to see it?


555
00:25:34.592 --> 00:25:36.009
- No.
- Must be American.


556
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:37.803
Part of their success
came from the fact


557
00:25:37.844 --> 00:25:39.388
that they were not plastic.

558
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.680
They were authentic.

559
00:25:40.722 --> 00:25:42.600
They came out of a
fairly tough city.


560
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.770
They were just being themselves
and that was astonishing.


561
00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.647
That was new to actually
be yourself, it was new.


562
00:25:49.689 --> 00:25:53.152
[Narrator] By presenting
themselves genuinely,


563
00:25:53.193 --> 00:25:55.488
The Beatles managed to
highlight the mannered,


564
00:25:55.529 --> 00:25:58.365
stilted exterior of
British cultural life


565
00:25:58.407 --> 00:26:01.785
at a time when it was already
showing signs of weakness.


566
00:26:01.827 --> 00:26:05.122
Polite society's attitude
to all forms of behavior,


567
00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:06.999
in particular sex,

568
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.502
had been prudish and
stuffy for centuries,


569
00:26:09.543 --> 00:26:13.213
but by the early 1960s
things were changing.


570
00:26:13.255 --> 00:26:15.174
At the beginning of the decade

571
00:26:15.215 --> 00:26:16.967
the novel Lady
Chatterley's Lover


572
00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:18.552
was successfully published.

573
00:26:18.594 --> 00:26:21.805
Withheld from the general
public since the late 1920s,


574
00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:24.600
this erotic tale of love
across the class divide


575
00:26:24.642 --> 00:26:27.102
became a phenomenon
upon its release,


576
00:26:27.144 --> 00:26:29.771
quickly selling over
three million copies.


577
00:26:29.813 --> 00:26:32.566
At the same time,
a scandal erupted


578
00:26:32.608 --> 00:26:34.818
at the very heart of the
British Establishment,


579
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.029
with the exposure
of an illicit affair


580
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.867
between politician John Profumo
and a 19-year-old model.


581
00:26:41.908 --> 00:26:44.286
The uptight sexual
attitudes of the British


582
00:26:44.328 --> 00:26:46.455
were being confronted in public.

583
00:26:46.497 --> 00:26:49.124
And then Beatlemania happened.

584
00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:53.086
By the summer of 1963, the
band's overwhelming effect


585
00:26:53.128 --> 00:26:56.882
on teenage girls was becoming
a nationwide epidemic.


586
00:26:56.923 --> 00:26:59.259
Their critics warned
that the Liverpudlians


587
00:26:59.301 --> 00:27:01.512
had unleashed a wave
of sexual frenzy


588
00:27:01.554 --> 00:27:03.222
in their female audience.

589
00:27:03.263 --> 00:27:05.849
Yet the liberation that The
Beatles offered these girls


590
00:27:05.891 --> 00:27:09.436
was more complicated
than it first appeared.


591
00:27:09.478 --> 00:27:11.564
What everybody
wanted to think,


592
00:27:11.605 --> 00:27:13.399
and also didn't want to think,

593
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.235
was this was somehow
all about eroticism,


594
00:27:16.276 --> 00:27:18.028
this was all about sex,

595
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.155
and that what was going on here

596
00:27:20.197 --> 00:27:23.576
was that these young women
were having something


597
00:27:23.617 --> 00:27:26.662
that looked like it
simulated a sexual experience


598
00:27:26.704 --> 00:27:30.708
in response to the sight
and sound of The Beatles.


599
00:27:30.748 --> 00:27:33.502
Therefore, it was always
talked and written about


600
00:27:33.544 --> 00:27:36.338
in the Freudian
terms of hysteria,


601
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.466
which of course is
a sexually charged term also.


602
00:27:39.508 --> 00:27:42.386
Were these girls orgasmic?
Was this orgasmic?


603
00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:44.221
That's not what was going on.

604
00:27:44.263 --> 00:27:47.099
[Chris] With rock
and roll in the 1950s,


605
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.019
that was a catalyst
for a lot of young men


606
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:56.816
finding a reason to be
something other than a version


607
00:27:56.858 --> 00:28:00.320
of their dad when they
became adolescents.


608
00:28:00.362 --> 00:28:03.449
It wasn't necessarily
fabulously articulate


609
00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:06.702
to dress as a teddy boy and
be a bit rowdy on the street,


610
00:28:06.744 --> 00:28:10.247
but at least it was
finding an identity.


611
00:28:10.289 --> 00:28:12.332
I think for a young female,

612
00:28:12.374 --> 00:28:14.042
it wasn't quite as
straightforward.


613
00:28:14.084 --> 00:28:15.961
Something like Beatlemania,

614
00:28:16.002 --> 00:28:18.171
the screaming that
surrounded The Beatles,


615
00:28:18.213 --> 00:28:20.215
it's quite tempting
to interpret it


616
00:28:20.257 --> 00:28:23.343
as a sort of howl of frustration

617
00:28:23.385 --> 00:28:26.472
as they try and find
their own identity,


618
00:28:26.513 --> 00:28:28.682
and it's as
inarticulate, in a way,


619
00:28:28.724 --> 00:28:30.976
as teddy boys
rampaging in cinemas.


620
00:28:31.017 --> 00:28:32.810
[Interviewer] Do
you deliberately try


621
00:28:32.852 --> 00:28:34.896
and create this
screaming reaction?


622
00:28:34.938 --> 00:28:37.608
No, we just arrive
at the theater,


623
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.818
and they're always
there waiting.


624
00:28:39.859 --> 00:28:42.821
Whenever we're doing a show,
the police always come and say,


625
00:28:42.862 --> 00:28:45.491
"Don't look out the window,
'cause you excite them."


626
00:28:45.532 --> 00:28:47.159
[laughing]

627
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.245
These girls were
controlling public space,


628
00:28:50.287 --> 00:28:53.206
and nobody could do
anything about it.


629
00:28:53.248 --> 00:28:56.418
It's a perfect example of what
we would call bad behavior.


630
00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.004
Screaming, yelling,
weeping in public.


631
00:28:59.045 --> 00:29:01.423
This is bad behavior
in one way or another.


632
00:29:01.465 --> 00:29:04.217
Yet, it was sanctioned,
not by the authorities,


633
00:29:04.259 --> 00:29:05.761
but by The Beatles themselves.

634
00:29:05.803 --> 00:29:09.473
[Narrator] The Beatles
phenomenon was unstoppable.


635
00:29:09.515 --> 00:29:12.434
At the end of August,
the single She Loves You


636
00:29:12.476 --> 00:29:14.019
became the fastest
selling record


637
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.647
that had ever been
released in the UK.


638
00:29:16.689 --> 00:29:19.274
In less than a year, the
band's success outstripped


639
00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:21.777
that of any artist
who had preceded them.


640
00:29:21.819 --> 00:29:24.279
And the final stage in
their conquest of Britain


641
00:29:24.321 --> 00:29:27.157
came on November 4th, 1963,

642
00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.785
when for the first time The
Beatles came face to face


643
00:29:29.827 --> 00:29:32.371
with the highest order
of the Establishment,


644
00:29:32.412 --> 00:29:34.247
the royal family.

645
00:29:34.289 --> 00:29:36.750
The occasion unleashed
the rock and roll rebel


646
00:29:36.792 --> 00:29:39.461
in John Lennon, who saw
in the night's performance


647
00:29:39.503 --> 00:29:42.922
an opportunity too
good to pass up.


648
00:29:42.964 --> 00:29:45.175
[Interviewer] John, In
this Royal Variety Show,


649
00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:46.844
when you're appearing
before royalty,


650
00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:49.346
your language has got to be
pretty good, obviously.


651
00:29:49.388 --> 00:29:50.764
This thing about
Ted Heath saying


652
00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:53.141
that he couldn't distinguish...

653
00:29:53.183 --> 00:29:55.268
- I can't understand that.
- The Queen's English...


654
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.896
I can't understand Teddy
saying that at all, really.


655
00:29:57.937 --> 00:29:59.398
[laughing]

656
00:29:59.439 --> 00:30:01.525
I'm not going to vote for Ted.

657
00:30:01.567 --> 00:30:03.736
[Interviewer] But
you're not going


658
00:30:03.777 --> 00:30:05.945
to change your act,
just for the...


659
00:30:05.987 --> 00:30:09.449
Ah no, like, we'll keep the
same kind of thing, won't we?


660
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:11.577
- Oh aye, yes.
- Yeah, that's right.


661
00:30:11.618 --> 00:30:16.540
Lennon always had an
ambivalent relationship with how


662
00:30:16.582 --> 00:30:21.545
the Entertainment Establishment
were cozying up to The Beatles.


663
00:30:21.587 --> 00:30:23.046
On the one hand,

664
00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:25.716
the professional in
him loved the fact


665
00:30:25.758 --> 00:30:28.552
that they were being
fantastically successful.


666
00:30:28.594 --> 00:30:32.347
But the rebel in him
found it all hard to take.


667
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:36.184
So on the occasion of the
Royal Command Performance,


668
00:30:36.226 --> 00:30:40.439
he teased Brian
Epstein by suggesting


669
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.192
that he was going to go up and
swear in front of the Queen.


670
00:30:44.234 --> 00:30:48.280
But in the end, his
professionalism won out.


671
00:30:48.321 --> 00:30:51.074
He managed to create a
little bit of subversion,


672
00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:54.160
but it was very carefully
thought through.


673
00:30:54.202 --> 00:30:55.788
[audience applauding]

674
00:30:55.829 --> 00:30:57.414
Thank you.

675
00:30:57.456 --> 00:31:01.334
For our last number, I'd
like to ask your help.


676
00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:04.922
Would the people in the
cheaper seats clap your hands?


677
00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:06.548
[laughing]

678
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.801
And the rest of you, if you
just rattle your jewelry.


679
00:31:11.637 --> 00:31:14.556
And this is like a moment
of insurrection, it felt like.


680
00:31:14.598 --> 00:31:18.852
But the thing is it wasn't
quite as radical perhaps


681
00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:21.271
because you look at Lennon's
face after he says it


682
00:31:21.313 --> 00:31:26.652
and he looks as if he's
just admitted to his mum


683
00:31:26.693 --> 00:31:29.237
that he's messed himself,
or something like that!


684
00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:31.323
It was something
really humble pie.


685
00:31:31.364 --> 00:31:33.116
He felt quite sheepish.

686
00:31:33.158 --> 00:31:35.327
But no one else but John
Lennon would come out


687
00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:37.579
and even have the
gall to say that.


688
00:31:37.621 --> 00:31:40.499
What may have seemed
a kind of revolutionary,


689
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.795
insurrectionary moment by
saying, rattle your jewelry,


690
00:31:44.837 --> 00:31:47.464
in a really class driven moment,

691
00:31:47.506 --> 00:31:50.133
was actually punctured
by this sense


692
00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:52.260
that The Beatles were nice boys

693
00:31:52.302 --> 00:31:55.681
and they can get
away with anything.


694
00:31:55.722 --> 00:31:57.808
[Narrator] With the youth
of Britain in their thrall,


695
00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:00.226
The Beatles headed out
to new territories,


696
00:32:00.268 --> 00:32:02.688
traveling to Scandinavia
at the close of the year


697
00:32:02.729 --> 00:32:04.356
and then on to France.

698
00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:09.653
The domestic pop scene
that they left behind


699
00:32:09.695 --> 00:32:11.989
had been transformed
by their success,


700
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.741
and from Liverpudlian acts
like Gerry and the Pacemakers


701
00:32:14.783 --> 00:32:16.785
to London's The Rolling Stones,

702
00:32:16.827 --> 00:32:19.955
new groups were emerging
on an almost weekly basis


703
00:32:19.997 --> 00:32:23.208
to battle it out in the
clubs and on the charts.


704
00:32:23.249 --> 00:32:25.251
The Beatles were
moving on, however,


705
00:32:25.293 --> 00:32:27.963
with manager Brian
Epstein's sights set firmly


706
00:32:28.005 --> 00:32:32.050
on the largest territory
of all: America.


707
00:32:32.091 --> 00:32:33.969
[Interviewer] Looking
forward to this American trip,


708
00:32:34.011 --> 00:32:35.470
have you had any
reaction over there?


709
00:32:35.512 --> 00:32:36.805
Have you got any
fan clubs going?


710
00:32:36.847 --> 00:32:38.306
There's one
supposedly started.


711
00:32:38.348 --> 00:32:41.935
They're getting quite
a good response.


712
00:32:41.977 --> 00:32:43.770
12,000 letters a day.

713
00:32:43.812 --> 00:32:45.814
[laughing]

714
00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:48.025
But The Beatle movement's
going over there?


715
00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:51.110
Yeah, it can even be
a Beatle booster, folks.


716
00:32:51.152 --> 00:32:54.031
I must tell you, by the
way, that Detroit University


717
00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.908
have got a Stamp out
The Beatles movement.


718
00:32:55.949 --> 00:32:57.325
- Oh yeah?
- Ah, no.


719
00:32:57.367 --> 00:32:58.994
We're going to
stamp out Detroit.


720
00:32:59.036 --> 00:33:02.789
They think your
haircuts are un-American.


721
00:33:02.831 --> 00:33:04.499
Well, that's very
observant of them


722
00:33:04.541 --> 00:33:06.585
because we aren't
American actually.


723
00:33:06.626 --> 00:33:10.047
There was always a thing
of, what happens next?


724
00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:13.592
Is The Beatles' bubble
is going to burst?


725
00:33:15.134 --> 00:33:16.970
But it never did.

726
00:33:17.012 --> 00:33:19.056
It just kept going on.

727
00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.640
[Narrator] If
Britain was suffering


728
00:33:20.682 --> 00:33:22.726
a particularly harsh
winter when The Beatles


729
00:33:22.768 --> 00:33:26.229
had first set the charts
alight in early 1963,


730
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:28.356
when their single I
Want to Hold Your Hand


731
00:33:28.398 --> 00:33:30.442
reached America
the following year,


732
00:33:30.483 --> 00:33:34.320
it entered a nation grappling
with far greater misfortunes.


733
00:33:34.362 --> 00:33:36.448
Having emerged from
the Second World War


734
00:33:36.489 --> 00:33:38.825
as one of the world's
two superpowers,


735
00:33:38.867 --> 00:33:40.869
the following decade
had been dominated


736
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:42.955
by the country's
hostile relationship


737
00:33:42.996 --> 00:33:44.372
with the Soviet Union

738
00:33:44.414 --> 00:33:47.417
and the threat of
a full blown nuclear war.


739
00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:49.377
But Americans
themselves were enjoying


740
00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:51.337
the fruits of
a flourishing economy,


741
00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:53.548
a strong consumer
culture had developed


742
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.259
and domestic confidence
was running high.


743
00:33:56.301 --> 00:34:00.806
In 1960, President John
F. Kennedy came to office,


744
00:34:00.847 --> 00:34:03.100
a young, charismatic politician

745
00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:04.977
who embodied this new confidence

746
00:34:05.018 --> 00:34:07.896
and who promised a bright
and optimistic future.


747
00:34:07.938 --> 00:34:12.109
My fellow citizens
of the world,


748
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.655
ask not what America
will do for you,


749
00:34:16.696 --> 00:34:21.326
but what together we can
do for the freedom of man.


750
00:34:21.367 --> 00:34:26.372
[Narrator] Three years
later, in November 1963,


751
00:34:26.414 --> 00:34:30.418
his assassination shook
the country to its core.


752
00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.588
There was this injection
of energy into American life


753
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.132
that he represented.

754
00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.009
He was young, he was handsome.

755
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:41.179
It represented such a marked
change from Dwight Eisenhower.


756
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.683
Eisenhower was a carry-over
from World War II.


757
00:34:44.724 --> 00:34:46.559
Obviously, he was a war hero.

758
00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:51.690
He was an extension of that
generation into modern America.


759
00:34:51.731 --> 00:34:54.359
But John Kennedy
was modern America.


760
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.570
All of the optimism
and youthfulness.


761
00:34:57.612 --> 00:34:59.238
The baby boom was going on.

762
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.534
You know, it was kind of
epitomized by John Kennedy.


763
00:35:02.575 --> 00:35:07.039
And the Kennedy
assassination just,


764
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.832
it just ended that.

765
00:35:08.874 --> 00:35:12.711
The Beatles
represented, also, youth,


766
00:35:12.752 --> 00:35:17.716
just as John Kennedy did,
and wit and intelligence.


767
00:35:17.757 --> 00:35:19.217
Certainly, for young people

768
00:35:19.258 --> 00:35:21.553
it turned things
around immediately.


769
00:35:21.594 --> 00:35:24.556
The Beatles just lit America up.

770
00:35:24.597 --> 00:35:26.933
I'm sure it could have
been something else.


771
00:35:26.975 --> 00:35:31.771
I'm sure that some other joyful
manifestation of something


772
00:35:31.813 --> 00:35:35.525
could have occurred, but
what occurred was a song.


773
00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:38.028
And it's really
important to realize


774
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.906
in Britain,
The Beatles' personalities,


775
00:35:40.947 --> 00:35:43.658
their repartee, their
whole public performance


776
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.620
was a critical part of the
way they came to the attention


777
00:35:47.662 --> 00:35:48.747
of the British public.

778
00:35:48.788 --> 00:35:50.999
In America, it was a song.

779
00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:55.754
♪ Oh yeah I tell you somethin'

780
00:35:55.795 --> 00:35:58.673
♪ I think you'll understand

781
00:35:58.715 --> 00:36:03.178
♪ When I say that somethin'

782
00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.598
♪ I want to hold your hand ♪

783
00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:09.434
It was the perfect vehicle

784
00:36:09.475 --> 00:36:15.023
to come into this traumatized
national atmosphere.


785
00:36:15.065 --> 00:36:16.983
What is the dominant
quality of the sound


786
00:36:17.025 --> 00:36:19.277
of John Lennon and Paul
McCartney signing together?


787
00:36:19.318 --> 00:36:21.320
Joy, joy in performance,

788
00:36:21.362 --> 00:36:23.531
joy in listening to
one another's voices,


789
00:36:23.573 --> 00:36:27.827
joy in whatever kind of
reinforcement is going on here.


790
00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:31.456
That's painting with
really broad strokes.


791
00:36:31.497 --> 00:36:33.083
There's nothing
subtle about that.


792
00:36:33.125 --> 00:36:35.334
There is no
question The Beatles


793
00:36:35.376 --> 00:36:36.920
changed everything immediately.

794
00:36:36.962 --> 00:36:40.590
I Want to Hold Your Hand
made a gigantic impact.


795
00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:43.051
Then of course the
flood gates opened,


796
00:36:43.093 --> 00:36:46.888
not only with one great
Beatles' song after another,


797
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.932
but the British Invasion.

798
00:36:48.974 --> 00:36:51.350
I mean, The Beatles just
knocked the door down.


799
00:36:51.392 --> 00:36:54.062
[Narrator] What The
Beatles had done to Britain


800
00:36:54.104 --> 00:36:56.564
they were now doing to America.

801
00:36:56.606 --> 00:37:00.026
Released at the close of

802
00:37:00.068 --> 00:37:03.155
I Want to Hold Your Hand had
sold more than a million copies


803
00:37:03.196 --> 00:37:06.616
and became the band's first
number one single in the US.


804
00:37:06.658 --> 00:37:08.827
A week after they
topped the charts,


805
00:37:08.868 --> 00:37:11.746
John, Paul, George and
Ringo crossed the Atlantic


806
00:37:11.788 --> 00:37:13.456
and arrived in New York City

807
00:37:13.498 --> 00:37:16.709
to greet a new set of
screaming teenage fans.


808
00:37:16.751 --> 00:37:19.045
They were also met by
members of the press


809
00:37:19.087 --> 00:37:21.506
keen to understand this
foreign phenomenon,


810
00:37:21.547 --> 00:37:23.133
and the group introduced them

811
00:37:23.175 --> 00:37:25.677
to their unique brand
of informal humor,


812
00:37:25.718 --> 00:37:28.763
as rare in America as
it had been in Britain.


813
00:37:28.805 --> 00:37:30.389
There's no question

814
00:37:30.431 --> 00:37:32.725
that the way they dealt
with the press was original.


815
00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:36.521
It was quite clear that they
were not like anything else.


816
00:37:36.562 --> 00:37:40.525
How smart they really
were, how funny they were!


817
00:37:40.566 --> 00:37:42.610
John and Paul in particular

818
00:37:42.652 --> 00:37:47.824
were extremely intelligent,
articulate, original people.


819
00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:52.370
And George was also
a very droll guy.


820
00:37:52.411 --> 00:37:55.665
And Ringo was sort
of a natural clown.


821
00:37:55.707 --> 00:37:59.919
Who was just that quick,
that smart,


822
00:37:59.961 --> 00:38:02.922
who was a pop star?

823
00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:06.634
I must be forgetting somebody,

824
00:38:06.676 --> 00:38:09.804
but damned if I can
think of who it would be.


825
00:38:09.846 --> 00:38:12.932
Do you think of your records
as funny records or as music?


826
00:38:12.974 --> 00:38:17.062
No, we think that
it's rather peculiar.


827
00:38:17.103 --> 00:38:19.022
Do you feel they're musical?

828
00:38:19.064 --> 00:38:21.691
Obviously they're musical,
because it's music, isn't it?


829
00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:23.068
Instruments make music.

830
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:24.861
It's a record.
- It's musical.


831
00:38:24.903 --> 00:38:28.656
You know: ♪ Bom ♪
It's music, isn't it?


832
00:38:28.698 --> 00:38:31.326
♪ Bom ♪
That's music too.


833
00:38:31.368 --> 00:38:33.619
He's good.
He knows music.


834
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:35.538
All right, but
what do you call it?


835
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.249
Do you call it rock and roll?

836
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.251
We try not to define it.

837
00:38:39.292 --> 00:38:42.962
We've got so many wrong
classifications of it.


838
00:38:43.004 --> 00:38:46.841
It's no use, we
just call it music.


839
00:38:46.883 --> 00:38:48.634
Even if you don't.

840
00:38:48.676 --> 00:38:50.887
- With a question mark?
- Pardon?


841
00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:52.889
- With a question mark?
- No.


842
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:55.100
With an exclamation mark.

843
00:38:55.141 --> 00:38:59.145
The underlying message
of The Beatles' wit


844
00:38:59.187 --> 00:39:02.982
in their press conferences
was about a youth movement


845
00:39:03.024 --> 00:39:09.364
that wasn't going to be
determined by old people.


846
00:39:09.406 --> 00:39:11.824
From the point of
The Beatles' arrival,


847
00:39:11.866 --> 00:39:15.078
they completely reinvented
how culture works.


848
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.665
Before that everything...
fashion, movies, music...


849
00:39:19.707 --> 00:39:21.459
it all was top down.

850
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.795
It all was what grown-ups liked,

851
00:39:23.836 --> 00:39:25.964
and then it filtered
down to the kids.


852
00:39:26.005 --> 00:39:29.175
After a year or two,
suddenly it was young people


853
00:39:29.217 --> 00:39:30.802
who were determining everything.

854
00:39:30.843 --> 00:39:32.845
That started with The Beatles.

855
00:39:32.887 --> 00:39:35.974
[Narrator] Having broken
all previous sales records


856
00:39:36.015 --> 00:39:37.725
in Britain the year beforehand,

857
00:39:37.767 --> 00:39:42.355
by April 1964, the band made
Billboard Hot 100 history


858
00:39:42.397 --> 00:39:44.565
by becoming the only act ever

859
00:39:44.607 --> 00:39:47.777
to occupy the first five
positions on the chart.


860
00:39:47.819 --> 00:39:51.281
The Four Mop-Tops were now
revolutionizing popular music


861
00:39:51.323 --> 00:39:52.949
in America too,

862
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:56.702
and Beatlemania spread like
wildfire throughout the country.


863
00:39:56.744 --> 00:39:58.246
And then, in July,

864
00:39:58.288 --> 00:40:00.415
following the time-honored
career trajectory


865
00:40:00.457 --> 00:40:02.917
of all post-war
popular entertainers,


866
00:40:02.959 --> 00:40:05.837
the band starred in their
first full-length feature film.


867
00:40:05.878 --> 00:40:08.881
Yet A Hard Day's Night
was, unsurprisingly,


868
00:40:08.923 --> 00:40:11.926
unlike anything that
had preceded it.


869

♪ It's been a hard day's night

872
00:40:23.396 --> 00:40:26.649
Music movies before
A Hard Day's Night


873
00:40:26.691 --> 00:40:28.485
were profit-making ventures

874
00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:32.405
intended exclusively
for the teen audience


875
00:40:32.447 --> 00:40:35.741
of whatever artist
happened to be in now.


876
00:40:35.783 --> 00:40:38.411
A Hard Day's Night
just flipped that.


877
00:40:38.453 --> 00:40:44.250
They took what was a toss-off
form, the rock movie,


878
00:40:44.292 --> 00:40:46.044
and made it something great.

879
00:40:46.085 --> 00:40:48.671
[Narrator] Directed by
American Richard Lester,


880
00:40:48.713 --> 00:40:51.341
the film created an
entirely new language


881
00:40:51.383 --> 00:40:53.718
for rock and roll cinema.

882
00:40:53.759 --> 00:40:56.137
Previously, musicians had
all made their transition


883
00:40:56.179 --> 00:40:58.597
to the big screen playing
fictional characters


884
00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:00.433
created by screenwriters.

885
00:41:00.475 --> 00:41:02.685
In A Hard Day's Night, however,

886
00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:05.271
The Beatles played
themselves in a comedy


887
00:41:05.313 --> 00:41:08.107
inspired by their own
experiences of fame.


888
00:41:08.149 --> 00:41:11.110
It was both a commercial
and a critical phenomenon.


889
00:41:11.152 --> 00:41:15.532
They're playing themselves
in a fictional film.


890
00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:17.700
That didn't happen.

891
00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:22.830
So much of what happened in
the early career of The Beatles


892
00:41:22.872 --> 00:41:24.665
hadn't really happened before.

893
00:41:24.707 --> 00:41:26.792
They were breaking through
on so many different levels.


894
00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:29.837
Tell me, how did
you find America?


895
00:41:29.879 --> 00:41:31.297
Turn left at Greenland.

896
00:41:31.339 --> 00:41:34.384
- Has success changed your life?
- Yes.


897
00:41:34.426 --> 00:41:36.219
I'd like to keep Britain tidy.

898
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:38.263
Are you a mod or a rocker?

899
00:41:38.304 --> 00:41:40.265
No, I'm a mocker.

900
00:41:40.306 --> 00:41:41.849
[laughing]

901
00:41:41.891 --> 00:41:43.684
Have you any hobbies?

902
00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:53.069
As I see it, it's
really A Hard Day's Night


903
00:41:53.111 --> 00:41:59.367
that establishes them as
something completely new


904
00:41:59.409 --> 00:42:04.289
and interesting beyond
your wildest imaginings.


905
00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:06.874
- I don't snore.
- You do, repeatedly.


906
00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:08.293
Do I snore, John?

907
00:42:08.334 --> 00:42:10.836
[John] Yeah, you're
a window rattler, son.


908
00:42:10.878 --> 00:42:13.548
That's just your opinion.
Do I snore, Paul?


909
00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.091
With a trombone
hooter like yours


910
00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:16.593
it would be unnatural
if you didn't.


911
00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:19.220
No, Paulie, don't
mock the afflicted.


912
00:42:19.262 --> 00:42:20.930
Ah, come off it.
It's only a joke.


913
00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:23.349
It may be a joke,
but it's his nose.


914
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:26.811
He can't help having
a hideous great hooter,


915
00:42:26.852 --> 00:42:28.396
and a poor little head

916
00:42:28.438 --> 00:42:30.022
trembling under
the weight of it.


917
00:42:30.064 --> 00:42:31.941
This was not the
rock and roll movie


918
00:42:31.983 --> 00:42:34.277
that you were expecting
to see, not at all.


919
00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:36.988
And although their wit,

920
00:42:37.029 --> 00:42:40.158
it had been clear
they were always funny


921
00:42:40.199 --> 00:42:43.702
on the microphone,
its irreverence


922
00:42:43.744 --> 00:42:46.623
and its irreverence
about themselves


923
00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:50.001
was just completely
unprecedented.


924
00:42:50.042 --> 00:42:54.005
And, of course, it just made
them seem even more godlike.


925
00:42:54.046 --> 00:42:55.965
[Narrator] And
while The Beatles


926
00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:59.718
embarked on a substantial US
tour in the summer of '64,


927
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.679
back in Britain
the whole country


928
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.389
was evolving in their wake.

929
00:43:03.431 --> 00:43:05.975
Following the sex scandals
of the previous year,


930
00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:08.478
the nation had turned
against the Establishment


931
00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.396
and voted in the
Labor government


932
00:43:10.438 --> 00:43:12.940
of new Prime Minister
Harold Wilson,


933
00:43:12.982 --> 00:43:15.193
a man who seemed to
represent the voice


934
00:43:15.234 --> 00:43:18.196
of a younger, more
progressive United Kingdom.


935
00:43:18.237 --> 00:43:20.657
Harold Wilson actually became
leader of the Labor party


936
00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:23.284
around the same time that
The Beatles were having


937
00:43:23.326 --> 00:43:25.537
the first stirrings
of huge success.


938
00:43:25.578 --> 00:43:27.830
He was northern.
Let's not forget that.


939
00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:31.709
So this was again part of
this big northern powerhouse.


940
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.003
You had The Beatles on
the popular culture sense,


941
00:43:34.045 --> 00:43:37.923
and then you had Harold Wilson
who was reflecting modernity


942
00:43:37.965 --> 00:43:39.967
in the political sense.

943
00:43:40.009 --> 00:43:42.345
We're thrusting
into a new world.


944
00:43:42.387 --> 00:43:44.722
We were behind
Europe in the '50s.


945
00:43:44.763 --> 00:43:45.973
The Tories had let us down.

946
00:43:46.015 --> 00:43:47.892
He wanted to:
Let's get modern.


947
00:43:47.933 --> 00:43:49.852
Like the Italians, like the
French, like the Germans,


948
00:43:49.894 --> 00:43:51.604
let's get working

949
00:43:51.646 --> 00:43:54.732
and let's make everyone enjoy
the fruits of the success.


950
00:43:54.773 --> 00:43:58.069
[gentle instrumental music]

951
00:44:01.072 --> 00:44:02.781
[Narrator]
And central to this new,


952
00:44:02.823 --> 00:44:05.326
progressive Britain
was its youth.


953
00:44:05.368 --> 00:44:07.579
The staggering
international success


954
00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.121
of the homegrown pop scene

955
00:44:09.163 --> 00:44:11.249
had injected the younger
generation with confidence,


956
00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.835
and, boosted by the
country's growing prosperity,


957
00:44:14.877 --> 00:44:17.796
a new consumer culture emerged.

958
00:44:17.838 --> 00:44:20.508
Fresh from the breeding
grounds of the art colleges,


959
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.260
the modern ideas

960
00:44:22.301 --> 00:44:24.803
of Britain's budding
designers were unleashed.


961
00:44:24.845 --> 00:44:26.847
This was nowhere more
apparent than in fashion,


962
00:44:26.889 --> 00:44:30.935
and its nerve center in London's
bustling Carnaby Street.


963
00:44:30.976 --> 00:44:33.771
This was the first time that
young people had enough money


964
00:44:33.812 --> 00:44:37.233
to buy records, to buy clothes,
to have their hair cut.


965
00:44:37.275 --> 00:44:40.361
Out of that almost immediately
came a separate youth market.


966
00:44:40.403 --> 00:44:42.029
Carnaby Street thrived.

967
00:44:42.071 --> 00:44:44.490
Up until that point,
when a girl left school,


968
00:44:44.532 --> 00:44:46.284
she immediately began
dressing like her mother.


969
00:44:46.325 --> 00:44:48.869
whereas someone like Mary Quant

970
00:44:48.911 --> 00:44:50.622
made dresses you could run in,

971
00:44:50.663 --> 00:44:54.833
you could dance in and do
stuff that young people do.


972
00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:57.002
And, of course, that
transformed the whole face


973
00:44:57.044 --> 00:44:58.421
of British fashion.

974
00:44:58.463 --> 00:45:01.173
Everything felt
modern, new, fresh.


975
00:45:01.215 --> 00:45:04.218
Everywhere you looked the world
started to look different.


976
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.097
The black and white of the
early Beatles and pre-Beatles,


977
00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:10.182
even with The Beatles
all in black and white,


978
00:45:10.224 --> 00:45:12.101
even A Hard Day's Night
was in black and white.


979
00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:15.688
Within a year, the colors
started to really emerge,


980
00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:19.150
the green shoots
of a new culture.


981
00:45:19.191 --> 00:45:21.944
[Narrator] Although they
had played the central role


982
00:45:21.986 --> 00:45:24.614
in cultivating this
new cultural landscape,


983
00:45:24.656 --> 00:45:28.660
by late 1964, The Beatles
themselves were growing weary


984
00:45:28.701 --> 00:45:30.745
of their Eight Days a Week fame.

985
00:45:30.787 --> 00:45:33.581
In an attempt to escape
from Beatlemania,


986
00:45:33.623 --> 00:45:35.708
both John Lennon
and George Harrison


987
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.376
had moved to rural Surrey,

988
00:45:37.418 --> 00:45:39.545
30 miles from the
center of London,


989
00:45:39.587 --> 00:45:42.632
and Ringo Starr would join
them there the following year.


990
00:45:42.674 --> 00:45:44.925
In December, Beatles For Sale,

991
00:45:44.967 --> 00:45:47.637
the band's fourth studio
album, was released,


992
00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:50.139
and it clearly showed
signs of fatigue.


993
00:45:50.181 --> 00:45:51.808
You only have to
look at the cover.


994
00:45:51.848 --> 00:45:54.268
These are young men
exhausted really


995
00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:56.729
by a couple of years
of Beatlemania.


996
00:45:56.771 --> 00:45:59.315
It was just obvious that
they were becoming worn out,


997
00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:02.318
and that the incredible
appeal of early fame,


998
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.279
which they just rode that
like a wonderful wave,


999
00:46:05.321 --> 00:46:07.406
and you can see and feel the joy

1000
00:46:07.448 --> 00:46:09.325
in the records and
the interviews.


1001
00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:14.831
By Beatles for Sale, it's
losing its luster quite quickly.


1002
00:46:14.871 --> 00:46:18.083
[Narrator] Yet the onward
march of youth culture


1003
00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:20.252
would soon revive the band.

1004
00:46:20.294 --> 00:46:23.130
While the kaleidoscopic
colors of Carnaby Street


1005
00:46:23.172 --> 00:46:24.632
were in full bloom,

1006
00:46:24.674 --> 00:46:27.009
a more experimental
subculture was developing


1007
00:46:27.051 --> 00:46:28.969
in West London, the
leaders of which


1008
00:46:29.011 --> 00:46:32.139
would soon cross paths
with The Beatles.


1009
00:46:32.181 --> 00:46:35.560
Inspired by avant-garde
literature, art and music,


1010
00:46:35.601 --> 00:46:38.437
this loose group of
artists and artisans


1011
00:46:38.479 --> 00:46:40.272
lacked a sense of community.

1012
00:46:40.314 --> 00:46:44.443
In June 1965, however,
Barry Miles, the manager


1013
00:46:44.485 --> 00:46:47.071
of renowned independent
bookshop Better Books,


1014
00:46:47.112 --> 00:46:50.949
arranged a momentous poetry
event at London's Albert Hall,


1015
00:46:50.991 --> 00:46:52.618
featuring Allen Ginsberg

1016
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.413
and other leading
American Beat writers.


1017
00:46:55.454 --> 00:46:57.540
It was of huge significance,

1018
00:46:57.582 --> 00:46:59.916
uniting the various
creative clans


1019
00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:02.294
of an emerging British
counterculture.


1020
00:47:02.336 --> 00:47:05.506
The big poetry reading
at the Albert Hall in '65


1021
00:47:05.548 --> 00:47:08.342
and was I think the
first time a constituency


1022
00:47:08.384 --> 00:47:10.010
was seen in London.

1023
00:47:10.052 --> 00:47:11.928
Up until that point the
actors and the poets


1024
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.224
and the filmmakers and the
people who ran boutiques,


1025
00:47:15.266 --> 00:47:17.059
none of them knew each other.

1026
00:47:17.101 --> 00:47:18.644
At this event,

1027
00:47:18.686 --> 00:47:20.730
which was basically
a Beat generation reading


1028
00:47:20.772 --> 00:47:23.900
of Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso,


1029
00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.234
all of these people
came together


1030
00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:27.820
into the Albert Hall,

1031
00:47:27.862 --> 00:47:29.988
The whole thing
was a giant party,


1032
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:35.119
really like the first mass
networking session, I suppose.


1033
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.037
[Narrator] At
this pivotal event


1034
00:47:37.079 --> 00:47:38.372
that he had helped organize,

1035
00:47:38.414 --> 00:47:41.375
Miles met John Dunbar,
an artist friendly


1036
00:47:41.417 --> 00:47:44.002
with both Allen Ginsberg
and Gregory Corso


1037
00:47:44.044 --> 00:47:48.424
and who had recently married
young singer Marianne Faithful.


1038
00:47:48.466 --> 00:47:50.217
Together, they
planned a new center


1039
00:47:50.259 --> 00:47:53.805
for underground activities,
the Indica Bookshop and Gallery,


1040
00:47:53.846 --> 00:47:56.140
and this would
bring Miles directly


1041
00:47:56.181 --> 00:47:58.267
into The Beatles' world.

1042
00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:00.352
We went along
to the Albert Hall


1043
00:48:00.394 --> 00:48:03.856
and a friend called
Paolo Leone went,


1044
00:48:03.898 --> 00:48:05.942
"Oh, you should meet this guy."

1045
00:48:05.982 --> 00:48:08.694
Miles worked at Better
Books at that point.


1046
00:48:08.736 --> 00:48:11.113
So we got chatting.

1047
00:48:11.155 --> 00:48:14.199
I don't know how many people
it holds, the Albert Hall,


1048
00:48:14.241 --> 00:48:16.368
couple of thousand,

1049
00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:17.787
Anyway, we kind of thought,

1050
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:19.996
everybody's paid a quid
to see this,


1051
00:48:20.038 --> 00:48:22.541
so maybe we could do a shop.

1052
00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:24.627
We decided to combine forces

1053
00:48:24.669 --> 00:48:27.839
and start a bookshop
art gallery combined.


1054
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.091
His best friend was a
guy called Peter Asher


1055
00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:33.552
who at that point was
in Peter and Gordon,


1056
00:48:33.594 --> 00:48:35.805
a little rock and folk duo

1057
00:48:35.847 --> 00:48:37.556
who had number
one hits, in fact,


1058
00:48:37.598 --> 00:48:39.350
in Britain and
America and Japan.


1059
00:48:39.391 --> 00:48:41.936
And so Peter had some money,
so naturally we looked to Peter


1060
00:48:41.978 --> 00:48:43.688
to finance this venture.

1061
00:48:43.729 --> 00:48:46.398
Consequently, we
started a company


1062
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.651
called Miles, Asher
and Dunbar, MAD.


1063
00:48:48.693 --> 00:48:51.696
I got to know Peter, of
course, through this.


1064
00:48:51.737 --> 00:48:53.948
He was living at home
with his parents.


1065
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.617
Also living at home was
his sister Jane Asher.


1066
00:48:56.659 --> 00:48:58.577
Jane was a TV personality.

1067
00:48:58.619 --> 00:49:00.329
She interviewed people.

1068
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:03.541
She was a child star in films
and did a lot on the radio.


1069
00:49:03.582 --> 00:49:06.711
Also living there was
Jane Asher's boyfriend


1070
00:49:06.752 --> 00:49:08.379
who was Paul McCartney,

1071
00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.839
who was living on the top floor

1072
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:12.341
in a little attic room
next to Peter's room.


1073
00:49:12.383 --> 00:49:14.259
So there was this
extraordinary household


1074
00:49:14.301 --> 00:49:16.094
that I got introduced to.

1075
00:49:16.136 --> 00:49:17.972
And when I was setting
up the bookshop,


1076
00:49:18.014 --> 00:49:19.974
we had all the books
delivered to the basement


1077
00:49:20.016 --> 00:49:21.642
because we hadn't
found any premises yet.


1078
00:49:21.684 --> 00:49:25.145
Obviously, through that I
got to know Paul as well.


1079
00:49:25.187 --> 00:49:27.857
He would come in late at
night, browse through the books


1080
00:49:27.899 --> 00:49:29.734
and just leave me a note
saying what he'd taken.


1081
00:49:29.775 --> 00:49:32.319
So he was my first customer,
in fact, in the bookshop.


1082
00:49:32.361 --> 00:49:33.821
When we did find some premises,

1083
00:49:33.863 --> 00:49:36.782
he helped put up the
shelves and paint the walls,


1084
00:49:36.824 --> 00:49:39.618
so he was very, very involved
with the whole project.


1085
00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.161
It was wonderful
to get to know him.


1086
00:49:41.203 --> 00:49:43.706
[Narrator] While his
bandmates had fled London


1087
00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:46.166
in favor of the
quiet suburban life,


1088
00:49:46.208 --> 00:49:48.627
through his contact with
the progressive art world,


1089
00:49:48.669 --> 00:49:52.840
Paul McCartney soon became the
most cultured of The Beatles.


1090
00:49:52.882 --> 00:49:55.009
Where John Lennon had
been married for years


1091
00:49:55.051 --> 00:49:56.719
and was raising a young son,

1092
00:49:56.761 --> 00:49:59.513
George Harrison had moved in
with girlfriend Patti Boyd


1093
00:49:59.555 --> 00:50:01.682
and Ringo Starr was a newlywed,

1094
00:50:01.724 --> 00:50:04.560
McCartney was actively
pursuing fresh sounds


1095
00:50:04.602 --> 00:50:08.814
and fresh concepts, with Miles
as his avant-garde guide.


1096
00:50:08.856 --> 00:50:10.315
In his own words,

1097
00:50:10.357 --> 00:50:12.317
he used to go round London
with his antenna out.


1098
00:50:12.359 --> 00:50:16.739
One day he would go to
see a John Cage concert


1099
00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:20.034
or Luciano Berio or
some electronic music.


1100
00:50:20.076 --> 00:50:22.536
Then the next day he would
go to see Tessie O'Shea


1101
00:50:22.578 --> 00:50:23.871
at the Talk of the Town,

1102
00:50:23.913 --> 00:50:26.874
or some torch singer
down at The Blue Angel.


1103
00:50:26.916 --> 00:50:28.751
It was all being sucked in.

1104
00:50:28.793 --> 00:50:32.254
McCartney was very much
the culturally aware Beatle


1105
00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:34.090
about town, while the others

1106
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.093
went into a slightly
cozier existence


1107
00:50:37.133 --> 00:50:38.677
in the stockbroker belt.

1108
00:50:38.719 --> 00:50:40.304
He was still curious,

1109
00:50:40.345 --> 00:50:43.975
he was still hungry
for any stimulation.


1110
00:50:44.016 --> 00:50:46.727
It's around this time,

1111
00:50:46.769 --> 00:50:51.440
that McCartney really
begins to drive The Beatles.


1112
00:50:51.482 --> 00:50:55.527
He hung around in
London, being stimulated,


1113
00:50:55.569 --> 00:50:59.115
and bringing all of that
back to The Beatles' table


1114
00:50:59.155 --> 00:51:03.410
and giving them, continuing
to give them an artistic edge.


1115
00:51:03.452 --> 00:51:07.123
[Narrator] That artistic
edge would prove unmistakable


1116
00:51:07.163 --> 00:51:10.459
when The Beatles headed
to the studio in mid-1965


1117
00:51:10.501 --> 00:51:12.419
to record the album Rubber Soul.

1118
00:51:12.461 --> 00:51:14.254
Across the previous year,

1119
00:51:14.296 --> 00:51:17.299
the wave of bands inspired
by The Beatles' example


1120
00:51:17.341 --> 00:51:19.969
had not only begun to catch
up with the Liverpudlians,


1121
00:51:20.011 --> 00:51:22.930
but in some cases
threatened to overtake them.


1122
00:51:22.972 --> 00:51:25.265
Following Lennon and
McCartney's lead,


1123
00:51:25.307 --> 00:51:27.434
the Rolling Stones had
managed to break America


1124
00:51:27.476 --> 00:51:30.062
and had begun to
write their own hits.


1125
00:51:30.104 --> 00:51:32.397
Folk icon Bob Dylan
had gone electric


1126
00:51:32.439 --> 00:51:35.151
and transformed into the
preeminent poet of rock,


1127
00:51:35.191 --> 00:51:38.487
and new bands were emerging,
from The Who to The Byrds,


1128
00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:41.782
introducing fresh
sounds and perspectives.


1129
00:51:41.824 --> 00:51:44.910
Yet The Beatles were ready
to pave the way once again.


1130
00:51:44.952 --> 00:51:47.663
In pursuit of total
creative control,


1131
00:51:47.705 --> 00:51:50.833
with Rubber Soul, producer
George Martin booked the band


1132
00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:53.669
into Abbey Road Studios
for an entire month,


1133
00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:56.797
turning conventional
recording rules on their head.


1134
00:51:56.839 --> 00:52:00.092
Before Rubber Soul,
a professional recording day


1135
00:52:00.134 --> 00:52:04.220
was overseen by recording
engineers in white coats.


1136
00:52:04.262 --> 00:52:07.474
And there was three hours in
the morning, a break for lunch,


1137
00:52:07.516 --> 00:52:09.727
and three hours
in the afternoon.


1138
00:52:09.768 --> 00:52:10.936
And that was it.

1139
00:52:10.978 --> 00:52:12.688
That was your recording day.

1140
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:16.984
When Rubber Soul came along,
they had enough clout to say,


1141
00:52:17.026 --> 00:52:19.695
we want a bit more
flexibility than that.


1142
00:52:19.737 --> 00:52:22.406
We might want to stay on
and record into the night.


1143
00:52:22.447 --> 00:52:26.827
They invented the idea
of treating a record album


1144
00:52:26.869 --> 00:52:29.705
as if it were a work of art.

1145
00:52:29.747 --> 00:52:33.249
It takes time to do
anything that's worthwhile.


1146
00:52:33.291 --> 00:52:35.544
So you had this new idea,

1147
00:52:35.586 --> 00:52:37.755
the idea of the recording studio

1148
00:52:37.796 --> 00:52:39.673
as compositional laboratory.

1149
00:52:39.715 --> 00:52:42.134
This was this incredible
real revolution,


1150
00:52:42.176 --> 00:52:44.720
not just how to make records,
but how to make music.

from the entertainment world,
in October 1965


1197
00:55:19.583 --> 00:55:23.212
they were invited to Buckingham
Palace to meet the Queen.


1198
00:55:23.254 --> 00:55:25.256
Here they would be
anointed as members


1199

of the Most Excellent Order of
the British Empire, or MBEs.


1200

This has been one of the
talents of the Establishment

for a very long time.

1202
00:55:33.805 --> 00:55:36.725
In fact, this is what
the MBEs and knighthoods


1203
00:55:36.767 --> 00:55:39.061
and all sorts of things
like that were all about.

At a certain point,

1205
00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:43.107
renegades need to be
brought into the fold.


1206
00:55:43.148 --> 00:55:46.568
But it's at that very
moment that they now,


1207
00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:49.363
'cause they were always
importing musical influences,


1208
00:55:49.405 --> 00:55:53.033
but they also become a conduit
for imported American influences

in these other fields that
they're getting interested in.


1210
00:55:55.202 --> 00:55:58.247
Miles is turning them
onto Ginsberg's poetry.


1211
00:55:58.289 --> 00:55:59.706
Robert Fraser is turning them

that at that very moment

00:56:07.172 --> 00:56:09.425
the British

No, she's not going

[Interviewer] Now
you've got this,


1226
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:32.406
do you feel that you're becoming
part of the Establishment,


1227
00:56:32.448 --> 00:56:33.657
as it's so called?

1228
00:56:33.698 --> 00:56:36.076
No, don't feel any different.

1229
00:56:36.118 --> 00:56:38.787
I still feel just like before.

1230
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:41.248
I feel exactly the same.
- You feel exactly the same.


1231
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:44.376
It was a recognition that
the pop world had come of age.


1232
00:56:44.418 --> 00:56:48.504
They were the aristocracy

working class culture.

that they would be rewarded

00:56:55.471 --> 00:56:58.432
in the spirit of
the new democracy.


1236
00:56:58.474 --> 00:57:01.685
But also it closed
a chapter, because from then on


1237
00:57:01.726 --> 00:57:03.728
they went off and
did it their way


1238
00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:06.064
which wasn't the
Establishment's way.


1239
00:57:06.106 --> 00:57:09.067
In fact, it was the
beginning of a period


1240
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:13.238
of great antagonism with the
Establishment and pop culture,


1241
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.824
and The Beatles, as usual,

1242
00:57:15.866 --> 00:57:17.784
were pretty much at
the center of that.


1243
00:57:17.826 --> 00:57:20.412
[Narrator] The Beatles'
position at the center


1244
00:57:20.454 --> 00:57:22.580
of these new developments
in youth culture


1245
00:57:22.622 --> 00:57:26.043
was crucial to their evolution
over the next two years.


1246
00:57:26.084 --> 00:57:28.170
With McCartney now
closely affiliated


1247
00:57:28.212 --> 00:57:31.965
with key players in London's
underground artistic scene,


1248
00:57:32.007 --> 00:57:35.093
and with similar movements in
both New York and Los Angeles


1249
00:57:35.135 --> 00:57:36.928
influencing American musicians,

1250
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:40.391
the stage was now set
for more radical ideas


1251
00:57:40.432 --> 00:57:41.892
to enter the mainstream.

1252
00:57:41.933 --> 00:57:43.519
And as these were developing,

1253
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.855
a new drug and a new figurehead
were gaining prominence


1254
00:57:46.897 --> 00:57:48.648
on both sides of the Atlantic.

1255
00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:51.109
The message is very simple.

1256
00:57:52.986 --> 00:57:55.489
Six words.

1257
00:57:55.531 --> 00:58:01.619
Turn on, tune in, drop out.

1258
00:58:01.661 --> 00:58:04.248
[Narrator] Psychologist
Timothy Leary had emerged


1259
00:58:04.289 --> 00:58:06.333
in the US as a
prominent spokesman


1260
00:58:06.375 --> 00:58:09.586
for the hallucinogen
LSD, or acid.


1261
00:58:09.627 --> 00:58:12.089
Having led psychedelic
experiments at


1262
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.883
Harvard University
since the turn of the '60s,


1263
00:58:14.925 --> 00:58:18.554
and with Beat poet Allen
Ginsberg a key early supporter,


1264
00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:23.559
by 1965 Leary was becoming a
major countercultural figure.


1265
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.772
Tim Leary was a psychiatrist,
psychoanalyst, psychotherapist.


1266
00:58:28.813 --> 00:58:31.316
He claimed to have
something like seven PhDs.


1267
00:58:31.358 --> 00:58:33.444
He was a professor at Harvard

1268
00:58:33.485 --> 00:58:37.030
who began working
originally with psilocybin


1269
00:58:37.072 --> 00:58:39.074
before he got onto LSD

1270
00:58:39.116 --> 00:58:43.370
as a way of treating prisoners
and treating mental illness.


1271
00:58:43.412 --> 00:58:45.830
I mean, the thing is
Leary was very much part


1272
00:58:45.872 --> 00:58:47.583
of the Establishment.

1273
00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:50.794
He'd worked right across the
normal lines of psychiatry.


1274
00:58:50.835 --> 00:58:53.046
But, of course, when he started
to take all these things,


1275
00:58:53.088 --> 00:58:57.384
he contacted his own self
on a cellular level


1276
00:58:57.426 --> 00:58:59.386
and he realized that
an awful lot of this


1277
00:58:59.428 --> 00:59:01.096
was gameplaying and rubbish.

1278
00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:04.224
So he basically felt that this
was in fact a spiritual key


1279
00:59:04.266 --> 00:59:06.101
that he'd been handed

1280
00:59:06.143 --> 00:59:07.978
and that his message
really should be


1281
00:59:08.019 --> 00:59:10.272
to encourage people to
leave the Establishment


1282
00:59:10.314 --> 00:59:13.567
and find themselves
creatively or spiritually.


1283
00:59:13.609 --> 00:59:17.279
[Narrator] And the newly
appointed MBEs, The Beatles,


1284
00:59:17.321 --> 00:59:19.990
were already on their way
to leaving the Establishment


1285
00:59:20.031 --> 00:59:22.784
and rediscovering themselves
through hallucinogens.


1286
00:59:22.826 --> 00:59:25.621
John Lennon and George
Harrison had been introduced


1287
00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:29.958
to LSD in early 1965, and had
been joined by Ringo Starr


1288
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.752
for their second experience
with the drug later that year.


1289
00:59:32.794 --> 00:59:36.089
Combined with Paul
McCartney's newfound interest


1290
00:59:36.131 --> 00:59:39.009
in experimental art through
his London social circle,


1291
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:41.470
the world's most commercial band

1292
00:59:41.512 --> 00:59:44.848
were ready to take a
very unexpected detour.


1293
00:59:44.889 --> 00:59:47.976
They wanted to
discover who they were.


1294
00:59:48.018 --> 00:59:50.770
They had no real sense of who
they were, I think, anymore.


1295
00:59:50.812 --> 00:59:52.606
So they were picking
up the pieces,


1296
00:59:52.648 --> 00:59:54.232
putting it together it again.

1297
00:59:54.274 --> 00:59:56.193
How the hell did they make sense

1298
00:59:56.234 --> 00:59:58.529
of the goldfish bowl life
they'd been thrown into?


1299
00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:03.074
From playing at the Casbah
in Liverpool, and the Cavern,


1300
01:00:03.116 --> 01:00:05.869
to being feted all
around the world


1301
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:07.663
and just seeing
themselves reflected back,


1302
01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:09.498
people getting pieces
of them everywhere,


1303
01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.333
not knowing really
who they were.


1304
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.878
And I think that was the
engagement of pop culture,


1305
01:00:14.919 --> 01:00:17.589
represented by The Beatles
with the counterculture,


1306
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:19.424
which was growing in confidence.

1307
01:00:19.466 --> 01:00:22.344
And the fact that the two
started to join forces


1308
01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:25.597
in London, in San Francisco...
they sparked off each other.


1309
01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:28.933
[Narrator] It was
at the close of 1965


1310
01:00:28.975 --> 01:00:31.186
that McCartney drew the
ever skeptical Lennon


1311
01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:32.896
out of his Surrey sanctuary

1312
01:00:32.937 --> 01:00:35.607
and introduced him to the
underground world of Miles


1313
01:00:35.649 --> 01:00:38.402
and the Indica
Bookshop and Gallery.


1314
01:00:38.443 --> 01:00:40.612
One day, very shortly
after we opened,


1315
01:00:40.654 --> 01:00:42.489
Paul McCartney showed
up with John Lennon,


1316
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:45.075
I think it was the first time
John was ever in the shop.


1317
01:00:45.116 --> 01:00:49.496
He was looking for
a book by "Nitzske."


1318
01:00:49.538 --> 01:00:53.375
I just didn't know who he meant.

1319
01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.335
It took me maybe half a minute

1320
01:00:55.377 --> 01:00:57.087
to figure out it was Nietzsche.

1321
01:00:57.128 --> 01:01:00.382
And that was just enough time
for him to get quite irritated


1322
01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:03.260
and think I was being this
middle class university type,


1323
01:01:03.301 --> 01:01:04.595
putting him down.

1324
01:01:04.636 --> 01:01:06.430
And then Paul had
to do his usual role


1325
01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:07.931
of sort of calming everybody.

1326
01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:09.683
"No, no, he went to art
school just like you.


1327
01:01:09.725 --> 01:01:12.060
It's just 'cause you
didn't know how to say it!"


1328
01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:13.395
In the meantime,

1329
01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.522
I remembered we had
only just the day before


1330
01:01:15.564 --> 01:01:16.981
had a big shipment

1331
01:01:17.023 --> 01:01:18.983
of The Psychedelic
Experience by Tim Leary.


1332
01:01:19.025 --> 01:01:21.361
John curled up on
the settee with it.


1333
01:01:21.403 --> 01:01:23.905
And literally in Tim
Leary's introduction


1334
01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:25.073
before you even get to the text,

1335
01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:27.701
it says, turn off
your mind, relax


1336
01:01:27.743 --> 01:01:30.787
and drift down the stream,
or however the lines are


1337
01:01:30.828 --> 01:01:34.291
that finally showed up
only about a month later


1338
01:01:34.332 --> 01:01:35.875
in Tomorrow Never Knows.

1339
01:01:35.917 --> 01:01:38.211
[Narrator] This song would be

1340
01:01:38.253 --> 01:01:39.796
the most innovative composition

1341
01:01:39.837 --> 01:01:42.132
of the band's career to date.

1342
01:01:42.173 --> 01:01:44.760
Alongside Lennon's
Leary-inspired lyrics,


1343
01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.470
Paul McCartney's contributions

1344
01:01:46.511 --> 01:01:49.013
to the track were
equally radical.


1345
01:01:49.055 --> 01:01:50.890
Having joined Miles at a number

1346
01:01:50.932 --> 01:01:53.059
of avant-garde
electronic music events,


1347
01:01:53.101 --> 01:01:55.604
the Beatle had begun
enthusiastically working


1348
01:01:55.646 --> 01:01:58.106
on his own experimental
compositions


1349
01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:00.317
using loops of recorded tape.

1350
01:02:00.358 --> 01:02:02.360
As The Beatles
entered the studio


1351
01:02:02.402 --> 01:02:04.988
to begin producing
Tomorrow Never Knows,


1352
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:07.157
George Martin invited McCartney

1353
01:02:07.198 --> 01:02:09.451
to bring these to the sessions.

1354
01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.411
He had produced a
whole load of them


1355
01:02:11.453 --> 01:02:14.456
and brought them into the
studio just in a plastic bag.


1356
01:02:14.498 --> 01:02:15.791
They arranged the studio

1357
01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.542
so that there were
different tape recorders


1358
01:02:17.584 --> 01:02:20.295
in different parts of the
Abbey Road studio complex.


1359
01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:23.674
And I was in a room
with Peter Asher


1360
01:02:23.715 --> 01:02:26.050
and we were playing
quite a long loop


1361
01:02:26.092 --> 01:02:29.929
which entailed
holding a jam jar.


1362
01:02:29.971 --> 01:02:32.182
The loop went round the jam jar,

1363
01:02:32.223 --> 01:02:34.476
then past the playback
head and then back over.


1364
01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:36.186
We had to keep it in tension.

1365
01:02:36.227 --> 01:02:38.355
I think there were eight
or maybe even 10 of us


1366
01:02:38.396 --> 01:02:39.773
around the building

1367
01:02:39.815 --> 01:02:42.359
all standing holding
pencils or jam jars.


1368
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.653
And all of this information
was going into the deck.


1369
01:02:44.695 --> 01:02:47.155
George Martin was just sitting
there with his headphones.


1370
01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:48.615
Whatever he did, of course,

1371
01:02:48.657 --> 01:02:51.034
it was impossible
to ever reproduce.


1372
01:02:51.075 --> 01:02:52.619
That was it.

1373
01:02:52.661 --> 01:02:54.663
That was the master as
soon as he pressed "record."


1374
01:02:54.705 --> 01:02:58.041
When I heard the playback,
it was astonishing actually.


1375
01:02:58.082 --> 01:03:01.044
I thought, "Good God,
this is the future."

["Tomorrow Never
Knows" by The Beatles]


1377

♪ Turn off your mind,
relax, and float downstream


1378

01:03:23.859 --> 01:03:26.069
The studio was an instrument.

1380
01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:30.073
Once upon a time, it was just
this almost invisible console


1381
01:03:30.114 --> 01:03:31.575
that was just there

1382
01:03:31.616 --> 01:03:33.577
to absorb what was being
played on the floor.


1383
01:03:33.618 --> 01:03:36.621
Now it was actually being
used as an instrument.


1384
01:03:36.663 --> 01:03:37.997
And it was more important

1385
01:03:38.039 --> 01:03:40.709
than individual
instruments, in a way.


1386
01:03:46.631 --> 01:03:50.427
This was unprecedented, and
the other interesting thing


1387
01:03:50.468 --> 01:03:52.011
about Tomorrow Never Knows,

1388
01:03:52.053 --> 01:03:54.097
it was the first
recording for Revolver.


1389
01:03:54.138 --> 01:03:56.307
It was done in April '66.

1390
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:58.351
I mean, this is extraordinary.

1391
01:03:58.393 --> 01:03:59.853
Tomorrow Never Knows

1392
01:03:59.895 --> 01:04:02.647
is undoubtedly the most
psychedelic song recorded


1393
01:04:02.689 --> 01:04:04.232
at that period.

1394
01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:05.942
There's nothing else like it.

1395
01:04:05.983 --> 01:04:08.111
I mean, the word
psychedelic wasn't really


1396
01:04:08.152 --> 01:04:09.987
in popular parlance at all.

1397
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:11.489
It was the title of a book

1398
01:04:11.531 --> 01:04:13.366
that John got from
Indica Gallery.


1399
01:04:13.408 --> 01:04:14.951
Tomorrow Never Knows

1400
01:04:14.992 --> 01:04:16.494
is definitely the world's
first psychedelic track.


1401
01:04:16.536 --> 01:04:18.413
The interesting
thing is, of course,


1402
01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:20.498
The Beatles were not only the
world's most commercial band,


1403
01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.333
but at that point they were also

1404
01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:26.170
the world's most experimental
band, which is very unusual.


1405
01:04:26.212 --> 01:04:29.299
[Narrator] That became clear
when The Beatles' follow-up


1406
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:34.596
to Rubber Soul, Revolver,
was issued in August 1966.


1407
01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.640
Alongside Tomorrow Never Knows,

1408
01:04:36.681 --> 01:04:38.558
the album's tracks were brimming

1409
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.560
with invention and originality.

1410
01:04:40.602 --> 01:04:44.439
If Rubber Soul had suggested
that pop music could be art,


1411
01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.817
Revolver confirmed it.

1412
01:04:46.858 --> 01:04:49.277
Revolver really
was The Beatles


1413
01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:51.237
moving towards the
fifth dimension.


1414
01:04:51.279 --> 01:04:54.324
"She said, she said I know
what it's like to be dead."


1415
01:04:54.365 --> 01:04:55.951
The Beatles, Lennon,
singing about


1416
01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.410
I know what
it's like to be dead.


1417
01:04:57.452 --> 01:04:59.203
What the hell is going on?

1418
01:04:59.245 --> 01:05:00.705
Well, they've been
partying with The Byrds


1419
01:05:00.747 --> 01:05:02.499
on the West Coast and
dropping acid by then.


1420
01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.042
Drugs, we have a very
negative view on them now


1421
01:05:05.084 --> 01:05:08.171
and you can be imprisoned
by them, but in the mid '60s


1422
01:05:08.212 --> 01:05:10.089
people felt it was the opposite.

1423
01:05:10.131 --> 01:05:12.759
It was to loosen the
chains of imprisonment,


1424
01:05:12.801 --> 01:05:15.345
this single view
of who you were.


1425
01:05:15.386 --> 01:05:17.597
And then suddenly
you had perspectives,


1426
01:05:17.639 --> 01:05:19.724
and with Revolver
you can hear it,


1427
01:05:19.766 --> 01:05:21.518
with all the different
production sounds...


1428
01:05:21.559 --> 01:05:24.479
it was all altered states
and perspectives.


1429
01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:27.565
The idea was basically
to turn rock and roll


1430
01:05:27.607 --> 01:05:29.776
into a legitimate art form.

1431
01:05:29.818 --> 01:05:31.319
And I think they did it.

1432
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:32.863
So many of the
things they tried,


1433
01:05:32.904 --> 01:05:35.699
from feedback and
reverse tapes and sitars,


1434
01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.283
whatever they did,

1435
01:05:37.325 --> 01:05:39.661
all over the world other
bands immediately tried out.


1436
01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:41.621
They were tremendous leaders.

1437
01:05:41.663 --> 01:05:43.540
Brian Epstein was concerned

1438
01:05:43.581 --> 01:05:46.334
that they were going too far
ahead of their fan base.


1439
01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.127
But they were very,
very sensible,


1440
01:05:48.169 --> 01:05:50.797
they always wanted to bring
the fans along with them.


1441
01:05:50.839 --> 01:05:53.591
They didn't want to
become some kind of wild,


1442
01:05:53.633 --> 01:05:57.178
avant-garde band that only

1443
01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.848
[Narrator] Epstein's
fears that the band


1444
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:02.934
would start to lose some of
their audience were unfounded


1445
01:06:02.976 --> 01:06:04.602
regarding their musical output,

1446
01:06:04.644 --> 01:06:08.105
but would prove accurate
in terms of their politics.


1447
01:06:08.147 --> 01:06:09.649
With The Beatles' compositions

1448
01:06:09.691 --> 01:06:12.109
expressing a more
complex world view,


1449
01:06:12.151 --> 01:06:15.906
journalists began to ask them
more significant questions.


1450
01:06:15.947 --> 01:06:17.949
In a series of
landmark interviews


1451
01:06:17.991 --> 01:06:20.243
for British newspaper
The Evening Standard,


1452
01:06:20.284 --> 01:06:22.495
the individual band
members were quizzed


1453
01:06:22.537 --> 01:06:24.706
over their thoughts
on current affairs.


1454
01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:27.124
Lennon's frank opinions
on Christianity


1455
01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:30.211
proved uncontroversial upon
their publication in Britain,


1456
01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:32.296
yet when they were
reprinted in America,


1457
01:06:32.338 --> 01:06:35.508
the first scandal of
The Beatles' career erupted,


1458
01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:38.762
with a single quote
becoming instantly infamous,


1459
01:06:38.803 --> 01:06:42.015
"We're more popular
than Jesus now."


1460
01:06:42.057 --> 01:06:44.684
The first time anybody
had asked John Lennon


1461
01:06:44.726 --> 01:06:48.021
questions about his
life and his philosophy.


1462
01:06:48.063 --> 01:06:50.899
And it just passed... whoosh...
without...


1463
01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:55.695
But months later, all
those teenage magazines


1464
01:06:55.737 --> 01:06:59.574
just printed that:
"We're bigger than Jesus,"


1465
01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:01.743
which caused a lot of problems.

1466
01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:04.203
A lot of problems.

1467
01:07:04.245 --> 01:07:08.165
Death threats and
records being burnt


1468
01:07:08.207 --> 01:07:09.876
and broken and smashed,

1469
01:07:09.918 --> 01:07:13.170
and the Ku Klux Klan,
and concerts being canceled.


1470
01:07:13.212 --> 01:07:17.092
It was very unpleasant
for everyone.


1471
01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:20.095
Well, originally I was
pointing out that fact


1472
01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.763
in reference to England,

1473
01:07:21.805 --> 01:07:25.141
that we meant more to
kids than Jesus did,


1474
01:07:25.182 --> 01:07:27.518
or religion, at that time.

1475
01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.437
I wasn't knocking it
or putting it down.


1476
01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.314
I was just saying it.
It was a fact.


1477
01:07:31.355 --> 01:07:34.734
Lennon's "The Beatles are
more popular than Jesus" line,


1478
01:07:34.776 --> 01:07:38.571
which even to me as a kid, I
could see what he was saying.


1479
01:07:38.613 --> 01:07:40.907
I mean, he wasn't saying...

1480
01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:43.534
It's what he said in his
quote unquote "apology."


1481
01:07:43.576 --> 01:07:45.453
"I wasn't saying we're
better than Jesus.


1482
01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:48.372
"I wasn't saying it's
good or it's bad.


1483
01:07:48.414 --> 01:07:49.791
It's just that it's true."

1484
01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:51.250
And to me it was
absolutely true.


1485
01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:52.710
It was unquestionable.

1486
01:07:52.752 --> 01:07:55.964
There was such a
backlash against that.


1487
01:07:56.006 --> 01:07:58.091
It made you aware of
some of the fault lines


1488
01:07:58.133 --> 01:07:59.801
in American culture.

1489
01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:02.804
Or made you aware once
again that what seemed maybe


1490
01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:05.098
like a unified culture,
really wasn't.


1491
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.184
And it was harsh.
You know, it was scary.


1492
01:08:08.225 --> 01:08:11.479
[Narrator] These fault
lines in American society


1493
01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:14.107
had been growing
since the early 1960s,


1494
01:08:14.149 --> 01:08:16.985
and where the civil rights
campaigns for racial equality


1495
01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:18.987
had most clearly exposed
these divisions


1496
01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:22.073
earlier in the decade,
by the mid 1960s


1497
01:08:22.115 --> 01:08:25.076
there was no issue more
pressing or more polarizing


1498
01:08:25.118 --> 01:08:27.078
than the Vietnam War.

1499
01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.665
Since the US entered into
the conflict in 1962,


1500
01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:33.250
it had provoked widespread
public opposition


1501
01:08:33.292 --> 01:08:37.547
and organized protests both
in the US and across Europe.


1502
01:08:37.588 --> 01:08:40.591
The underground movement
McCartney had become involved in


1503
01:08:40.633 --> 01:08:44.137
had itself emerged from the
early '60s pacifist movement


1504
01:08:44.179 --> 01:08:48.099
in the UK, and by the time
of their 1966 US tour,


1505
01:08:48.141 --> 01:08:50.601
privately both he
and his bandmates


1506
01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:52.687
were opponents of the war.

1507
01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.731
As they traveled across America,

1508
01:08:54.772 --> 01:08:56.733
already battling controversy,

1509
01:08:56.774 --> 01:09:00.153
the ever honest Liverpudlians
came under fire once again


1510
01:09:00.195 --> 01:09:04.074
when they made this position
absolutely clear to the press.


1511
01:09:04.115 --> 01:09:07.827
In 1966, the war was
without any question


1512
01:09:07.869 --> 01:09:11.581
much more on people's minds
in America than The Beatles.


1513
01:09:11.622 --> 01:09:14.417
Nineteen-sixty-six was the year
the war exploded.


1514
01:09:14.458 --> 01:09:17.795
Nineteen-sixty-six was the year
that the number of draftees


1515
01:09:17.837 --> 01:09:19.505
more than doubled
in this country.


1516
01:09:19.547 --> 01:09:21.424
Nineteen-sixty-six
was also the year


1517
01:09:21.465 --> 01:09:24.094
in which the war really got
terrible in Vietnam itself.


1518
01:09:24.135 --> 01:09:27.388
It was a bigger, bigger
deal all the time.


1519
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.640
There was more
destruction going on.


1520
01:09:29.682 --> 01:09:33.853
At the height of American
involvement in Vietnam,


1521
01:09:33.895 --> 01:09:37.023
they had 550,000
troops in that country.


1522
01:09:37.065 --> 01:09:39.609
I mean, that's a
lot of young people.


1523
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:42.237
There was a draft in
the United States.


1524
01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:45.865
The war had come home
in a big way.


1525
01:09:45.907 --> 01:09:48.952
It wasn't an abstract
issue in any regard.


1526
01:09:48.993 --> 01:09:53.206
And youth representatives
like The Beatles,


1527
01:09:53.248 --> 01:09:55.541
people who were part
of youth culture,


1528
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:58.586
were expected to
take a stand on it.


1529
01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.421
[Man] It seems to me
you've always been successful


1530
01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:03.091
because you've been outspoken
and direct and forthright


1531
01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:04.592
and all this sort of thing.

1532
01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:06.136
Does it seem a bit hard to you

1533
01:10:06.177 --> 01:10:10.014
that people are now knocking
you for this very thing?


1534
01:10:10.056 --> 01:10:11.390
Yes, Richard.

1535
01:10:11.432 --> 01:10:13.601
- It seems very hard.
- It seems hard.


1536
01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:15.895
But you know, free speech.

1537
01:10:15.937 --> 01:10:17.855
[Richard] But is it possible
just to say what you think


1538
01:10:17.897 --> 01:10:19.690
all the time? What about

1539
01:10:19.732 --> 01:10:21.442
who think you're
absolutely marvelous


1540
01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:23.111
and can't bear to be hurt?

1541
01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:25.947
When we say anything
like that, we don't say it,


1542
01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:29.909
as older people seem to
think, to be offensive.


1543
01:10:29.951 --> 01:10:32.036
We mean it helpfully, you know.

1544
01:10:32.078 --> 01:10:34.455
And if it's wrong what
we say, okay, it's wrong.


1545
01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:37.292
People can say you're
wrong about that one.


1546
01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.627
But in many cases, we
believe it's right.


1547
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:41.587
We're quite serious about it.

1548
01:10:41.629 --> 01:10:43.840
[Richard] Do you mind
being asked questions?


1549
01:10:43.881 --> 01:10:45.258
For example, in America

1550
01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.759
people keep asking you
questions about Vietnam.


1551
01:10:46.801 --> 01:10:48.678
Does this seem useful?
- Well, I don't know.


1552
01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:50.429
If you can say
that war's no good


1553
01:10:50.471 --> 01:10:52.974
and a few people believe
you, then it may be good.


1554
01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:55.310
You can't say it too much,
though, that's the trouble.


1555
01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.853
It seems a bit
silly to be in America


1556
01:10:56.894 --> 01:10:58.646
and for none of them
to mention Vietnam


1557
01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:00.273
as if nothing was happening.

1558
01:11:00.315 --> 01:11:02.817
They were the first band
to be asked about politics,


1559
01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:06.070
about Vietnam, about a whole
number of social issues.


1560
01:11:06.112 --> 01:11:07.446
And in fact, I mean,

1561
01:11:07.488 --> 01:11:09.573
although Dylan came
a little bit before,


1562
01:11:09.615 --> 01:11:12.785
as far as I know, he never
once ever came out in public


1563
01:11:12.827 --> 01:11:14.411
against the Vietnam War.

1564
01:11:14.453 --> 01:11:16.372
So maybe The Beatles
were the first there,


1565
01:11:16.413 --> 01:11:19.000
in terms of a very
well-known band.


1566
01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:20.793
Well, it cost them a lot.

1567
01:11:20.835 --> 01:11:24.255
There were then teenage girls
in the South, in the Midwest,


1568
01:11:24.297 --> 01:11:26.841
who didn't like
The Beatles anymore.


1569
01:11:26.883 --> 01:11:29.093
I think The Beatles
are a real talented group,


1570
01:11:29.135 --> 01:11:30.928
but I think they need
to watch what they say,


1571
01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:33.056
because they're in
such a position


1572
01:11:33.097 --> 01:11:35.766
that a lot of teenagers
really think of them


1573
01:11:35.808 --> 01:11:37.352
as something really big.

1574
01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.103
When they say things like that

1575
01:11:39.145 --> 01:11:41.564
some teenagers are going to
just believe anything they say.


1576
01:11:41.605 --> 01:11:45.235
In 1965, The Beatles
were universally beloved.


1577
01:11:45.276 --> 01:11:46.736
Nobody didn't like them.

1578
01:11:46.777 --> 01:11:50.031
They were just
wonderful and funny


1579
01:11:50.073 --> 01:11:53.368
and creative and unthreatening.

1580
01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:58.622
As they became more involved
in the counterculture


1581
01:11:58.664 --> 01:12:00.499
and more representative of it,

1582
01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:02.919
they lost a lot of
that belovedness.


1583
01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.338
They helped to move
a lot of people


1584
01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:07.131
who might not otherwise
have gone along


1585
01:12:07.173 --> 01:12:10.676
with the stuff that happened
in '66 and '67 and '68.


1586
01:12:10.718 --> 01:12:12.303
Without any question,

1587
01:12:12.345 --> 01:12:15.806
they were inspirational and
influential in that way.


1588
01:12:15.848 --> 01:12:17.934
But they also lost
a lot of people.


1589
01:12:17.975 --> 01:12:23.189
They became part of what
many, many people in America,


1590
01:12:23.231 --> 01:12:26.943
probably a majority
of people in America,


1591
01:12:26.984 --> 01:12:31.488
regarded as a disturbing...

1592
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:33.950
loosening of values and morals.

1593
01:12:33.991 --> 01:12:36.994
And a political threat.

1594
01:12:37.036 --> 01:12:39.747
[Narrator] And at exactly
this point,


1595
01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:43.542
The Beatles ceased operating
as a traditional band.


1596
01:12:43.584 --> 01:12:45.378
Upon their return from the US,

1597
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.298
they announced that they were
abandoning live performance,


1598
01:12:48.339 --> 01:12:49.799
with the final show

1599
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.635
of the American tour
their last ever paid gig.


1600
01:12:52.676 --> 01:12:55.346
And then the most photographed
celebrities in the world


1601
01:12:55.388 --> 01:12:58.808
simply disappeared from
the public eye altogether.


1602
01:12:58.849 --> 01:13:01.894
[ reporter
Can I have a word?


1603
01:13:01.936 --> 01:13:05.689
Are The Beatles going to
go their own ways in 1967?


1604
01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:08.859
We could be on
our own or together.


1605
01:13:08.901 --> 01:13:11.404
We're always involved with each
other, whatever we're doing.


1606
01:13:11.446 --> 01:13:12.655
Could you ever see a time

1607
01:13:12.696 --> 01:13:15.450
when you weren't
working together?


1608
01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:18.161
I could see us working
not together for a period,


1609
01:13:18.202 --> 01:13:20.413
but we'd always get together
for one reason or another.


1610
01:13:20.455 --> 01:13:24.208
I mean, you need other
people for ideas as well,


1611
01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:27.795
you know,
and we all get along fine.


1612
01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:30.173
[Narrator] Rumors of a
break-up began to circulate.


1613
01:13:30.214 --> 01:13:32.175
Yet, away from the spotlight,

1614
01:13:32.216 --> 01:13:34.177
the four Liverpudlians
were hard at work


1615
01:13:34.218 --> 01:13:37.180
on their most ambitious
production to date.


1616
01:13:37.221 --> 01:13:39.265
The public would have
to wait for months


1617
01:13:39.307 --> 01:13:41.058
before The Beatles reappeared,

1618
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.520
and when, in February 1967,
they finally did,


1619
01:13:44.561 --> 01:13:46.647
both their image and their sound

1620
01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:49.942
had undergone a
startling transformation.


1621
01:13:49.984 --> 01:13:52.111
Strawberry Fields of course
was originally intended


1622
01:13:52.153 --> 01:13:54.738
as part of the Sgt. Pepper
sessions.


1623
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.075
But the press kept on saying,
"Are The Beatles finished?


1624
01:13:58.117 --> 01:14:01.120
"They've disappeared,
they've run out of ideas,"


1625
01:14:01.162 --> 01:14:03.206
not realizing that
they were working


1626
01:14:03.247 --> 01:14:05.958
on one of their
greatest achievements.


1627
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.295
And to me, obviously,
it wasn't unexpected


1628
01:14:09.337 --> 01:14:11.464
because, well, I was at
some of the sessions.


1629
01:14:11.506 --> 01:14:15.051
But I think to the public
it came as quite a shock.


1630
01:14:19.347 --> 01:14:21.724

to Strawberry Fields... ♪


1632
01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:32.151
"Strawberry Fields Forever"
was something else again.


1633
01:14:32.193 --> 01:14:34.653
It was:
The Beatles had gone weird.


1634
01:14:34.695 --> 01:14:36.655
That was basically
what people felt.


1635
01:14:36.697 --> 01:14:39.283
What is wrong with them?
That's...


1636
01:14:39.325 --> 01:14:40.826
"Let me take you down

1637
01:14:40.868 --> 01:14:43.204
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields."


1638
01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:45.039
The voice, it didn't
sound like Lennon.


1639
01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:46.707
Well, that's because they'd
slowed the voice down.


1640
01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:49.919
Nothing sounded
normal on that record.


1641
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.504
The whole production.

1642
01:14:51.546 --> 01:14:54.173
Everything was up in the
air, put through effects.


1643
01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:56.633
And then there was a video that
was made at the time as well,


1644
01:14:56.675 --> 01:15:00.430
shot in Sevenoaks or somewhere,
and it was the strangest thing.


1645
01:15:00.471 --> 01:15:02.890
You had Ringo as if
he was disembodied.


1646
01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:04.392
They were falling out of trees.

1647
01:15:04.434 --> 01:15:06.227
There was nothing
like that at all.

1653

It had more in common

1654
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.169
and the Surrealists and Dada.

1655
01:15:32.211 --> 01:15:35.590
All these highfalutin
art kind of ideas,


1656
01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:38.593
which was once
the preserve, really,


1657
01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:41.345
mainly,
of the educated elite.


1658
01:15:41.387 --> 01:15:44.181
But this is The Beatles now
bringing it to everybody.


1659
01:15:44.223 --> 01:15:49.145
The short film for Strawberry
Fields had a seismic impact


1660
01:15:49.186 --> 01:15:53.023
because it showed that they
had traveled a distance


1661
01:15:53.065 --> 01:15:56.735
that, well, I felt it
kind of incumbent on me


1662
01:15:56.777 --> 01:16:01.198
to then travel as a young
person who believed in them.


1663
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.950
It was like, "Wow, okay,

1664
01:16:02.992 --> 01:16:05.869
this is what's being
asked of me now."


1665
01:16:05.911 --> 01:16:08.205
It wasn't just,
"Oh, they look cool."


1666
01:16:08.247 --> 01:16:11.125
It was, "All right,
this is the path."


1667
01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:13.877
[Narrator] And that
path became even clearer


1668
01:16:13.919 --> 01:16:15.004
as the year progressed.

1669
01:16:15.045 --> 01:16:17.714
By the turn of 1967,

1670
01:16:17.756 --> 01:16:20.259
the counterculture
was gaining momentum,


1671
01:16:20.301 --> 01:16:21.885
with huge numbers of youths

1672
01:16:21.927 --> 01:16:23.638
gravitating towards
its new Mecca,


1673
01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:26.432
San Francisco's
Haight-Ashbury district.


1674
01:16:26.474 --> 01:16:29.310
From here, a strong musical
scene was developing,


1675
01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:31.895
headed by psychedelic
bands The Grateful Dead


1676
01:16:31.937 --> 01:16:33.564
and the Jefferson Airplane,

1677
01:16:33.606 --> 01:16:37.193
and word spread of a new
phenomenon: the hippy.


1678
01:16:37.234 --> 01:16:40.363
In the UK, the underground's
influence expanded,


1679
01:16:40.404 --> 01:16:43.407
with its own newspaper,
The International Times,


1680
01:16:43.449 --> 01:16:45.368
a live music club, UFO,

1681
01:16:45.409 --> 01:16:47.537
and emerging stars
the Pink Floyd


1682
01:16:47.578 --> 01:16:49.746
and the American,
Jimi Hendrix.


1683
01:16:49.788 --> 01:16:52.416
Into this blooming
scene of peace, love


1684
01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:54.001
and mind-expanding drugs,

1685
01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:56.795
came The Beatles' most
ambitious work to date,


1686
01:16:56.837 --> 01:16:59.215
one which would not
only capture the essence


1687
01:16:59.256 --> 01:17:00.716
of this new sensibility,

1688
01:17:00.757 --> 01:17:03.969
but also transform the
record industry once again:


1689
01:17:04.011 --> 01:17:07.264
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band.


1690
01:17:07.306 --> 01:17:09.308
Presented as a work of art,

1691
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.562
with a single concept
unifying the album as a whole,


1692
01:17:12.603 --> 01:17:15.481
it announced that the age of
the traditional pop single


1693
01:17:15.523 --> 01:17:17.733
and the pop band was over.

1694
01:17:17.774 --> 01:17:21.820
Sgt. Pepper revolutionized
the record industry.


1695
01:17:21.862 --> 01:17:25.949
All of a sudden, albums
sold as much as singles.


1696
01:17:25.991 --> 01:17:28.619
Sgt. Pepper sold
in the millions.


1697
01:17:28.661 --> 01:17:33.165
On pure business terms, it
was a revolutionary release.


1698
01:17:33.207 --> 01:17:35.834
But also it was
revolutionary in terms


1699
01:17:35.876 --> 01:17:38.671
of letting the
record industry know


1700
01:17:38.713 --> 01:17:40.548
precisely what it could sell.

1701
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:45.553
What you could do is invest
in the finest artistic minds


1702
01:17:45.595 --> 01:17:50.849
of a generation and give them
the freedom to make their art,


1703
01:17:50.891 --> 01:17:55.605
package it up as an album
and sell it in the millions.


1704
01:17:55.646 --> 01:17:59.358
Paul had this idea of,
"we want to get away


1705
01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.069
"from being the four mop-tops
and The Fab Four.


1706
01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.862
"So we create this new
name for ourselves.


1707
01:18:03.904 --> 01:18:05.781
"We're going to be
a different group.


1708
01:18:05.822 --> 01:18:07.366
That'll give us the freedom
to do what the hell we want."


1709
01:18:07.408 --> 01:18:09.993
That is the basic concept.
The songs...


1710
01:18:10.035 --> 01:18:12.371
many of those songs
could have been on


1711
01:18:12.413 --> 01:18:14.123
any of the other albums.

1712
01:18:14.164 --> 01:18:16.833
They weren't specific
to that particular one.


1713
01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:19.295
But the influence of it
was staggering.


1714
01:18:19.336 --> 01:18:21.422
The Beatles were a force
to be reckoned with.


1715
01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:24.425
Even The Stones were badly
affected by them at that point.


1716
01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:26.135
Everyone just had
to deal with them.


1717
01:18:26.176 --> 01:18:27.344
They were like a roadblock.

1718
01:18:27.386 --> 01:18:28.845
If you were in the
music business,


1719
01:18:28.887 --> 01:18:30.765
you had to deal with
this great big thing


1720
01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:33.768
in front of you and get
round it the best you could.

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Heart Club's Band,


1727
01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:02.630
I mean, just the title
itself was a piece of art


1728
01:19:02.672 --> 01:19:04.757
and something that
mystified people.


1729
01:19:04.799 --> 01:19:06.300
Peter Blake did the cover,

1730
01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.719
and Peter Blake was the
father of British Pop Art.


1731
01:19:08.761 --> 01:19:11.138
Everything about Sgt. Pepper
was an enigma.


1732
01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.475
The fact that they were
pretending to not be The Beatles


1733
01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:15.810
but to be another band.

1734
01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:18.145
The locked groove at
the end of side two.


1735
01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:20.856
Lucy in the sky with
diamonds. Ah, L-S-D.


1736
01:19:20.897 --> 01:19:23.984
Secret messages all
the way through.


1737
01:19:24.026 --> 01:19:26.403
It was like a work
of literature.


1738
01:19:26.445 --> 01:19:27.946
It was like a Ulysses
or something,


1739
01:19:27.988 --> 01:19:29.156
where people were just thinking,

1740
01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:30.741
I don't quite understand this

1741
01:19:30.783 --> 01:19:33.076
but there's definitely
something really going on.


1742
01:19:33.118 --> 01:19:35.245
[Narrator] This
combination of imagination


1743
01:19:35.287 --> 01:19:37.373
and mystery proved irresistible.

1744
01:19:37.414 --> 01:19:39.834
With Sgt. Pepper, The
Beatles transformed


1745
01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:44.338
from pop culture icons into
mystics of the modern age.


1746
01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.007
When The Beatles came
out with their new song,


1747
01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:49.593
people started pondering
that these are people


1748
01:19:49.635 --> 01:19:53.430
that you're looking
to for meaning.


1749
01:19:53.472 --> 01:19:55.850
[Barry] By '67,
I think the release


1750
01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.476
of Sgt. Pepper in America

1751
01:19:57.518 --> 01:19:59.269
established
The Beatles basically


1752
01:19:59.311 --> 01:20:01.313
as the leaders of
the counterculture


1753
01:20:01.355 --> 01:20:02.773
along with a few other people

1754
01:20:02.815 --> 01:20:04.817
like Allen Ginsberg,
Timothy Leary.


1755
01:20:04.859 --> 01:20:08.529
But The Beatles were
the musical leaders.


1756
01:20:08.571 --> 01:20:12.616
Right across the board, they
were seen as, yes, as gods.


1757
01:20:12.658 --> 01:20:15.911
Leary himself said a lot
of silly things about them,


1758
01:20:15.952 --> 01:20:18.330
they were a type of new
superheroes, leaders of men,


1759
01:20:18.372 --> 01:20:20.207
and all this stuff.

1760
01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:24.628
I'm not convinced that the
youth culture in the mid '60s


1761
01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:29.091
were terribly aware of
LSD and Timothy Leary


1762
01:20:29.132 --> 01:20:31.886
and even counterculture
attitudes.


1763
01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:37.140
If it hadn't been for that
conduit that was The Beatles,


1764
01:20:37.182 --> 01:20:40.143
this sort of stuff
might have just stayed


1765
01:20:40.185 --> 01:20:42.646
in San Francisco, in California.

1766
01:20:42.688 --> 01:20:45.190
The counterculture wasn't
called the "underground"


1767
01:20:45.232 --> 01:20:47.192
for no reason.

1768
01:20:47.234 --> 01:20:48.611
Not many people knew about it.

1769
01:20:48.652 --> 01:20:51.363
[Narrator] Yet
The Beatles were determined


1770
01:20:51.405 --> 01:20:53.616
to spread the word even further.

1771
01:20:53.657 --> 01:20:55.951
At the end of June 1967,

1772
01:20:55.992 --> 01:20:58.662
less than a month after
the release of Sgt. Pepper's,


1773
01:20:58.704 --> 01:21:00.080
the band were invited

1774
01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:02.291
to represent Britain
in the first ever


1775
01:21:02.332 --> 01:21:05.252
international satellite
television broadcast.


1776
01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:07.922
Across the US,
Canada and Europe,


1777
01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:10.382
the youthful optimism
of the counterculture


1778
01:21:10.424 --> 01:21:13.636
was reaching its peak
during the Summer of Love,


1779
01:21:13.677 --> 01:21:16.472
with thousands flocking
to large public events.


1780
01:21:16.513 --> 01:21:19.725
With their historic contribution
to the One World broadcast,


1781
01:21:19.767 --> 01:21:22.770
The Beatles delivered the
scene's definitive anthem


1782
01:21:22.812 --> 01:21:27.817
to an audience of over 500
million viewers worldwide.


1783
01:21:27.858 --> 01:21:29.568
The Beatles, true to form,

1784
01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:32.446
national representatives
representing their country,


1785
01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:34.490
they start with
the national anthem.


1786
01:21:34.531 --> 01:21:37.952
The only problem is it's
the French national anthem!


1787
01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:39.745
That's a classic.

1788
01:21:39.787 --> 01:21:41.413
That is total Beatles humor.

1789
01:21:41.455 --> 01:21:44.708

1793
01:22:05.855 --> 01:22:07.648
It was fun.
I was at that one.


1794
01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:09.065
It was like a party.

1795
01:22:09.107 --> 01:22:10.860
They'd invited a load
of their friends,


1796
01:22:10.901 --> 01:22:13.111
The Small Faces and
The Rolling Stones,


1797
01:22:13.153 --> 01:22:16.031
and everybody was there,
all in our psychedelic finery.


1798
01:22:16.072 --> 01:22:17.616
Sitting on the floor there,

1799
01:22:17.658 --> 01:22:21.620
it looked like it might
all explode at some point.


1800
01:22:21.662 --> 01:22:22.705
And there was an awful lot
of frantic waving


1801
01:22:22.746 --> 01:22:25.123
and people rushing around,

1802
01:22:25.165 --> 01:22:27.710
holding on to their headphones
and talking to people.


1803
01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:29.085
That was mostly

1804
01:22:29.127 --> 01:22:30.462
to do with the international
link-up, though,


1805
01:22:30.504 --> 01:22:32.088
because no one had
ever done that before.


1806
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:34.550
It really did go out live
all around the world.


1807
01:22:34.591 --> 01:22:36.218
It was fantastic.

1808

♪ Love is all you need... ♪

1812
01:22:54.319 --> 01:22:58.782
This is mere weeks after
the release of Sgt. Pepper.


1813
01:22:58.824 --> 01:23:03.537
Every other band would
choose to use that moment


1814
01:23:03.579 --> 01:23:07.374
to promote Sgt. Pepper by doing
a couple of tracks from it.


1815
01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:09.752
Right? It just makes total
business sense.


1816
01:23:09.793 --> 01:23:15.549
But they took the opportunity
to send a message to the world


1817
01:23:15.591 --> 01:23:18.719
that all you need is love.

1818
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:21.179
They'd already been
saying it on Rubber Soul,


1819
01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:22.765
the word is love.

1820
01:23:22.806 --> 01:23:25.017
But this was the time they
could tell the whole world


1821
01:23:25.059 --> 01:23:26.727
all at the same time.

1822
01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:29.980
The Beatles are clearly
leading the way.


1823
01:23:30.022 --> 01:23:32.190
I think there's a
great significance


1824
01:23:32.232 --> 01:23:35.652
in the idea of them sitting
on those high chairs,


1825
01:23:35.694 --> 01:23:38.906
with the beautiful people of
London, including Mick Jagger,


1826
01:23:38.948 --> 01:23:42.242
sitting at their feet,
looking up at them


1827
01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:45.287
and singing along to a song
they've only just heard.


1828
01:23:45.328 --> 01:23:46.956
That's powerful.

1829
01:23:46.997 --> 01:23:50.208
[Narrator] All You Need Is
Love was an anthem of hope


1830
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.544
from a youth movement
certain that the old order


1831
01:23:52.586 --> 01:23:54.337
was about to crumble.

1832
01:23:54.379 --> 01:23:57.049
The Beatles were steering
an entire generation


1833
01:23:57.091 --> 01:23:58.842
into uncharted territory,

1834
01:23:58.884 --> 01:24:01.219
yet it would not take
the Establishment long


1835
01:24:01.261 --> 01:24:04.556
to respond to these
peaceful revolutionaries.


1836
01:24:04.598 --> 01:24:06.767
In the UK, the
police were mobilized


1837
01:24:06.809 --> 01:24:08.811
and began to make a
number of drug busts,


1838
01:24:08.852 --> 01:24:11.063
arresting not only
prominent figures


1839
01:24:11.105 --> 01:24:12.606
on the underground scene

1840
01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:14.524
but also Mick Jagger,
Keith Richards


1841
01:24:14.566 --> 01:24:17.653
and later Brian Jones
of the Rolling Stones.


1842
01:24:17.694 --> 01:24:19.571
These high-profile cases

1843
01:24:19.613 --> 01:24:21.907
didn't faze Paul
McCartney, however.


1844
01:24:21.949 --> 01:24:24.785
Following the arrests,
he not only paid for,


1845
01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:27.203
but also put his name to
a national press advert


1846
01:24:27.245 --> 01:24:30.332
calling for the
legalization of marijuana.


1847
01:24:30.373 --> 01:24:32.918
Weeks later, he
admitted to a journalist


1848
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.544
that he had taken LSD

1849
01:24:34.586 --> 01:24:36.880
and repeated this in
a television interview,


1850
01:24:36.922 --> 01:24:39.466
much to the shock
of Brian Epstein.


1851
01:24:39.508 --> 01:24:42.344
Brian didn't like
things being made public.


1852
01:24:42.385 --> 01:24:44.304
He was a very private person,

1853
01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:47.265
obviously, because of
his way of life.


1854
01:24:47.307 --> 01:24:52.479
The thing about
drugs is it wasn't


1855
01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:55.065
anything about them
being good or bad.


1856
01:24:55.107 --> 01:24:57.693
It's just it was illegal.

1857
01:24:57.734 --> 01:25:02.447
[Interviewer] Paul, how
often have you taken LSD?


1858
01:25:02.489 --> 01:25:04.116
About four times.

1859
01:25:04.158 --> 01:25:06.743
[Interviewer] Where
did you get it from?


1860
01:25:06.785 --> 01:25:10.288
If I was to say where I
got it from, it's illegal.


1861
01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:11.832
It's silly to say that.

1862
01:25:11.874 --> 01:25:14.084
Don't you believe
that this was a matter


1863
01:25:14.126 --> 01:25:16.837
which you should
have kept private?


1864
01:25:16.879 --> 01:25:22.051
The thing is, I was asked
a question by a newspaper


1865
01:25:22.092 --> 01:25:25.345
and the decision was
whether to tell a lie


1866
01:25:25.387 --> 01:25:28.765
or to tell him the truth.

1867
01:25:28.807 --> 01:25:31.768
I decided to tell him the truth.

1868
01:25:33.269 --> 01:25:36.439
But I really didn't want
to say anything.


1869
01:25:36.481 --> 01:25:39.985
If I'd had my decision,
if I had it my way,


1870
01:25:40.027 --> 01:25:42.071
I wouldn't have told anyone.

1871
01:25:42.112 --> 01:25:45.448
'Cause I'm not trying to
spread the word about this.


1872
01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:48.451
But the man from the
newspaper is the man


1873
01:25:48.493 --> 01:25:49.995
from the mass medium.

1874
01:25:50.037 --> 01:25:53.456
I'll keep it a personal
thing if he does too,


1875
01:25:53.498 --> 01:25:55.542
if he keeps it quiet.

1876
01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:57.293
But he wanted to spread it.

1877
01:25:57.335 --> 01:26:00.296
So it's his responsibility
for spreading it, not mine.


1878
01:26:00.338 --> 01:26:02.799
The thing is, Paul
is always honest.


1879
01:26:02.841 --> 01:26:05.052
If a reporter asked him,
have you taken LSD?,


1880
01:26:05.094 --> 01:26:07.012
he's going to say yes.
He wouldn't lie.


1881
01:26:07.054 --> 01:26:08.388
Why should he?

1882
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:09.639
If they're going to
ask that question,


1883
01:26:09.681 --> 01:26:10.974
they get an honest answer.

1884
01:26:11.016 --> 01:26:13.268
It was a risky thing
for him to say.


1885
01:26:13.309 --> 01:26:16.980
It probably gave Brian
Epstein a conniption.


1886
01:26:17.022 --> 01:26:21.985
But basically, although The
Beatles had made a lot of money,


1887
01:26:22.027 --> 01:26:23.987
they were never really
in it for the money.


1888
01:26:24.029 --> 01:26:27.074
Once they had enough to
really live well, that was it.


1889
01:26:27.116 --> 01:26:29.076
I think that was a
very good sign of them.


1890
01:26:29.118 --> 01:26:32.079
They paid their tax and
they said what they wanted.


1891
01:26:32.121 --> 01:26:34.456
[Narrator] The Beatles'
sense of security


1892
01:26:34.497 --> 01:26:36.625
was about to be
challenged, however.


1893
01:26:36.666 --> 01:26:39.628
In late August, the band were
shocked to receive the news


1894
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:42.464
that their manager
Brian Epstein had died,


1895
01:26:42.505 --> 01:26:44.466
their most trusted accomplice.

1896
01:26:44.507 --> 01:26:46.551
In his absence they
were suddenly left


1897
01:26:46.593 --> 01:26:49.012
without his
stabilizing influence.


1898
01:26:51.098 --> 01:26:52.724
At the same time,

1899
01:26:52.766 --> 01:26:56.061
their quest for personal and
spiritual growth continued.


1900
01:26:56.103 --> 01:26:58.396
George Harrison had
become fascinated


1901
01:26:58.438 --> 01:27:00.857
by Indian music in 1965,

1902
01:27:00.899 --> 01:27:03.568
and as he immersed
himself in its techniques,


1903
01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:07.823
he became increasingly drawn
to its spiritual foundations.


1904
01:27:07.864 --> 01:27:10.700
This led him to
discover the Indian guru


1905
01:27:10.742 --> 01:27:12.619
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

1906
01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:15.622
and his technique of
transcendental meditation.


1907
01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:19.334
By mid-1967, Harrison was
introducing his bandmates


1908
01:27:19.375 --> 01:27:21.295
to the Maharishi's ideas,

1909
01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:24.089
and soon The Beatles had
a new spiritual advisor.


1910
01:27:26.633 --> 01:27:28.677
When they first got
involved with him,


1911
01:27:28.718 --> 01:27:30.887
I wrote and asked Allen
Ginsberg what the story


1912
01:27:30.929 --> 01:27:32.806
was on the Maharishi, in India,

1913
01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:35.142
because Ginsberg had lived there
for a number of years


1914
01:27:35.184 --> 01:27:39.437
and he knew a lot of the
gurus and the teachers.


1915
01:27:39.479 --> 01:27:43.025
He wrote back saying the
Maharishi was very commercial


1916
01:27:43.066 --> 01:27:46.402
and that he was under
a lot of criticism in India


1917
01:27:46.444 --> 01:27:48.488
for taking disciples' money,

1918
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:50.991
because in fact the
teaching should be free.


1919
01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:53.202
So I reported this to
John Lennon who came out


1920
01:27:53.243 --> 01:27:55.578
with a wonderful line of,

1921
01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:57.122
"Ain't no ethnic bastard

1922
01:27:57.164 --> 01:28:00.083
going to get any golden
castles out of me."


1923
01:28:00.125 --> 01:28:02.836
[Narrator] Despite his
initial reservations,


1924
01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:05.755
in February 1968, Lennon
and his bandmates


1925
01:28:05.797 --> 01:28:09.926
traveled to India for an
extended retreat with the guru.


1926
01:28:09.968 --> 01:28:12.679
Joined by their various
wives and girlfriends,


1927
01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:15.640
their departure to the East
for spiritual fulfillment


1928
01:28:15.682 --> 01:28:17.642
made headlines worldwide.

1929
01:28:17.684 --> 01:28:19.728
The press swarmed
around the perimeter


1930
01:28:19.769 --> 01:28:22.272
of the Maharishi's

1931
01:28:22.314 --> 01:28:25.400
both intrigued and baffled
by this latest chapter


1932
01:28:25.441 --> 01:28:27.610
in The Beatles'
unpredictable journey.


1933
01:28:27.652 --> 01:28:30.780
This exposure brought Eastern
religion to the attention


1934
01:28:30.822 --> 01:28:33.242
of an enormous audience.

1935
01:28:33.283 --> 01:28:36.411
Sometime in January,
it was sudden,


1936
01:28:36.452 --> 01:28:38.872
"Right, we're off to Maharishi

1937
01:28:38.914 --> 01:28:42.376
to live in a holiday
camp in India."


1938
01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:45.087
"Oh, right.
Have a good time.


1939
01:28:45.128 --> 01:28:47.839
But they did write a
heck of a lot of songs


1940
01:28:47.881 --> 01:28:50.592
while they were there,
churning them out.


1941
01:28:50.633 --> 01:28:52.802
The Beatles
introduced the world,


1942
01:28:52.844 --> 01:28:54.179
especially the young world,

1943
01:28:54.221 --> 01:28:56.848
to things they would
never have stumbled upon


1944
01:28:56.890 --> 01:28:58.474
had The Beatles not been there.

1945
01:28:58.516 --> 01:29:01.395
The philosophy
behind transcendental


1946
01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:04.606
meditation, Buddhism,
they were looking outwards.


1947
01:29:04.647 --> 01:29:06.900
Meditation was at
the center of it.


1948
01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:08.777
That's actually really
all that matters.


1949
01:29:08.818 --> 01:29:11.487
It's the soul.
The reality is here.


1950
01:29:11.529 --> 01:29:13.615
Not many people had really
thought about that before.


1951
01:29:13.656 --> 01:29:16.492
And if The Beatles, the most
popular band in the world,


1952
01:29:16.534 --> 01:29:18.536
the most popular cultural
phenomenon in the world,


1953
01:29:18.578 --> 01:29:21.915
were talking earnestly
about this stuff,


1954
01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:25.543
obviously, as much as a lot
of the elders might laugh,


1955
01:29:25.585 --> 01:29:27.837
at least as many young
people went along with them.


1956
01:29:27.879 --> 01:29:31.633
And, you know, sales of
texts of Eastern wisdom


1957
01:29:31.674 --> 01:29:34.010
went through the roof
in the late '60s.


1958
01:29:34.052 --> 01:29:36.305
People flocked to
see the Maharishi.


1959
01:29:36.346 --> 01:29:40.016
The Beatles were this
gateway to another world.


1960
01:29:40.058 --> 01:29:42.936
[Narrator] Although the
band emerged from India


1961
01:29:42.978 --> 01:29:45.647
both spiritually and
creatively refreshed,


1962
01:29:45.688 --> 01:29:48.524
this sense of calm
would be short-lived.


1963
01:29:48.566 --> 01:29:53.529
In February 1968, they set up
their own corporation, Apple.


1964
01:29:53.571 --> 01:29:56.158
This multifaceted
company was developed


1965
01:29:56.199 --> 01:29:57.993
to broaden
The Beatles' activities


1966
01:29:58.034 --> 01:30:00.620
and to retain full
control over their output.


1967
01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:04.082
Yet it would prove the first
of many overambitious projects


1968
01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:05.875
for the band.

1969
01:30:05.917 --> 01:30:08.044
As they entered the
studio in the summer


1970
01:30:08.086 --> 01:30:10.088
to work on their
follow-up to Sgt. Pepper,


1971
01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:13.175
for the first time, creative
and personal disputes


1972
01:30:13.216 --> 01:30:15.551
crept into the
recording sessions.


1973
01:30:15.593 --> 01:30:18.721
A particular source of
tension was the daily presence


1974
01:30:18.763 --> 01:30:21.433
of an outsider in
The Beatles' inner sanctum,


1975
01:30:21.475 --> 01:30:24.102
the conceptual artist Yoko Ono,

1976
01:30:24.144 --> 01:30:27.272
with whom John Lennon had
fallen deeply in love.


1977
01:30:27.314 --> 01:30:30.233
It was a relationship that had
been blossoming, in private,


1978
01:30:30.275 --> 01:30:31.818
for more than a year.

1979
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:34.112
While McCartney had been
growing in confidence


1980
01:30:34.154 --> 01:30:35.989
through his
underground activities,


1981
01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:40.202
Lennon's sense of isolation
in rural Surrey had increased.


1982
01:30:40.243 --> 01:30:43.038
Initially finding a
release through LSD,


1983
01:30:43.079 --> 01:30:46.916
it was Yoko Ono who offered
him a means of escape.


1984
01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:50.045
A relatively unknown artist
when she had traveled to London


1985
01:30:50.086 --> 01:30:52.839
with husband Tony Cox in 1966,

1986
01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:54.757
it was through
the Indica Gallery


1987
01:30:54.799 --> 01:30:57.093
that she came into
contact with Lennon.


1988
01:30:57.135 --> 01:30:59.762
Its owner, John Dunbar,
provided the space


1989
01:30:59.804 --> 01:31:02.224
for Ono's first UK exhibition,

1990
01:31:02.265 --> 01:31:04.434
and it was he who
invited his Beatle friend


1991
01:31:04.476 --> 01:31:06.811
to attend this unusual show.

1992
01:31:06.853 --> 01:31:09.939
She was plainly an
interesting, powerful woman.


1993
01:31:09.981 --> 01:31:14.403
I didn't show ordinary pictures
on the wall at all, really.


1994
01:31:14.444 --> 01:31:18.614
And so, you know, she had some
good ideas and I liked them.


1995
01:31:18.656 --> 01:31:19.991
She wanted to do a show.

1996
01:31:20.033 --> 01:31:22.827
We managed to find
a couple of weeks


1997
01:31:22.869 --> 01:31:25.038
where we didn't
have something on.


1998
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.957
Yoko was reluctant to
have anybody look at it


1999
01:31:27.999 --> 01:31:31.127
until she'd totally finished
and labeled everything.


2000
01:31:31.169 --> 01:31:33.129
So we were sort of doing that.

2001
01:31:33.171 --> 01:31:37.217
But me and Tony had
to sort of tell her,


2002
01:31:37.259 --> 01:31:40.803
"Look, this guy might buy
something, you never know."


2003
01:31:40.845 --> 01:31:44.516
He came round and he
did like the ladder


2004
01:31:44.558 --> 01:31:47.810
and then looking through
the magnifying glass


2005
01:31:47.852 --> 01:31:49.854
and it says "yes,"
so, he liked that.


2006

[Narrator] The
relationship that developed


2007
01:31:51.898 --> 01:31:53.525
across the following two years

2008
01:31:53.567 --> 01:31:56.278
would be consummated
in May 1968,


2009
01:31:56.319 --> 01:31:59.364
just before The Beatles began
work on the White Album.


2010
01:31:59.406 --> 01:32:01.783
Lennon emerged a changed man,

2011
01:32:01.824 --> 01:32:03.826
released from an
unhappy marriage


2012
01:32:03.868 --> 01:32:06.121
and liberated as an artist.

2013
01:32:06.162 --> 01:32:08.498
The arrival of Yoko Ono
into John's life


2014
01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:11.126
transformed Lennon completely.

2015
01:32:11.167 --> 01:32:14.628
She was the mother,
lover, teacher.


2016
01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:17.799
She was kind of everything
really to John. He needed that.


2017
01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.843
When he met Yoko, she was
basically a mother figure.


2018
01:32:20.885 --> 01:32:22.720
I mean, he used to
call her "mother."


2019
01:32:22.762 --> 01:32:25.014
She, for her own reasons,
took him on,


2020
01:32:25.056 --> 01:32:26.308
and saved him, actually.

[crowd chanting]

2022
01:32:33.231 --> 01:32:36.359
[Narrator] As Ono's presence
made an impact on both Lennon


2023
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:38.320
and the bond
between The Beatles,


2024
01:32:38.361 --> 01:32:41.239
the world outside of the
band began to darken.


2025
01:32:41.281 --> 01:32:45.160
As the war in Vietnam spiraled
further out of control


2026
01:32:45.201 --> 01:32:48.079
and with no apparent end
to the conflict in sight,


2027
01:32:48.121 --> 01:32:51.124
across the West, the
cultural movement so inspired


2028
01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.626
by The Beatles

2029
01:32:52.666 --> 01:32:55.545
no longer believed
love is all you need.


2030
01:32:55.587 --> 01:32:58.590
The progressive, liberal
core of the counterculture


2031
01:32:58.632 --> 01:33:01.050
came under fire, with
the assassinations


2032
01:33:01.092 --> 01:33:03.637
of, first, civil rights
leader Martin Luther King,


2033
01:33:03.677 --> 01:33:06.222
and, then, Presidential
candidate Robert Kennedy,


2034
01:33:06.264 --> 01:33:08.558
increasing tensions.

2035
01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.185
Both in the US and Britain,

2036
01:33:10.226 --> 01:33:12.562
once peaceful anti-war
demonstrations


2037
01:33:12.604 --> 01:33:14.147
descended into violence.

2038
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:16.858
Student riots brought
Paris to a standstill,


2039
01:33:16.899 --> 01:33:18.652
and images of street skirmishes

2040
01:33:18.692 --> 01:33:21.821
and police brutality
became commonplace.


2041
01:33:21.863 --> 01:33:24.574
As the authorities led
an unforgiving onslaught


2042
01:33:24.616 --> 01:33:26.075
on the counterculture,

2043
01:33:26.117 --> 01:33:29.787
revolution replaced love
as the new objective.


2044
01:33:29.829 --> 01:33:32.706
In '68, it all exploded.

2045
01:33:32.748 --> 01:33:35.126
You know, you had
assassinations in the States,


2046
01:33:35.168 --> 01:33:37.671
the threat of civil war,

2047
01:33:37.711 --> 01:33:39.589
riots in the
Democratic Convention,


2048
01:33:39.631 --> 01:33:44.010
riots in Paris, in London,
violence on the streets.


2049
01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:46.680
Actually, there was
a sort of a fight. Power...


2050
01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:49.307
you don't really get power,
it won't trickle down.


2051
01:33:49.349 --> 01:33:53.144
It has to be
sort of... forced.


2052
01:33:53.186 --> 01:33:55.647
If you look at history,
that tends to be the case.


2053
01:33:55.689 --> 01:33:58.358
The Beatles revolution
was a benign one,


2054
01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.276
through art and love,

2055
01:34:00.318 --> 01:34:03.572
but by '68, the bricks were
flying all over the place.


2056
01:34:03.613 --> 01:34:07.576
It wasn't just
the sweet utopianism


2057
01:34:07.617 --> 01:34:12.414
of the Summer of Love,
but really days of rage.


2058
01:34:12.455 --> 01:34:15.584
The demonstrations at
the Democratic Convention


2059
01:34:15.625 --> 01:34:18.211
in Chicago in 1968,

2060
01:34:18.253 --> 01:34:21.339
you know, was a kind
of dividing line.


2061
01:34:21.381 --> 01:34:23.966
You saw the police out
there clubbing kids,


2062
01:34:24.008 --> 01:34:28.179
and there really was a sense of,
"We're kind of at war now."


2063
01:34:28.221 --> 01:34:31.307
[Narrator] Just as this
unrestrained police brutality


2064
01:34:31.349 --> 01:34:34.269
tore through Chicago
in August 1968,


2065
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:37.021
The Beatles issued
the single Revolution,


2066
01:34:37.063 --> 01:34:40.650
addressing the struggles of
a youth culture under threat.


2067
01:34:40.692 --> 01:34:43.861
Yet unlike All You Need
Is Love the previous year,


2068
01:34:43.903 --> 01:34:46.989
John Lennon's composition
refused to express the voice


2069
01:34:47.031 --> 01:34:48.700
of this disillusioned movement

2070
01:34:48.742 --> 01:34:51.661
or to accept the call to
arms of the radical Left.


2071
01:34:51.703 --> 01:34:54.539
For the first time, this
saw The Beatles turned upon


2072
01:34:54.581 --> 01:34:56.666
by their own peers.

2073
01:34:56.708 --> 01:34:59.127
Yet Lennon's reluctance
to commit to violence


2074
01:34:59.168 --> 01:35:01.755
not only led to two different
versions of the track


2075
01:35:01.795 --> 01:35:04.048
but also reflected
the inner struggles


2076
01:35:04.090 --> 01:35:06.676
that many young people
were dealing with.


2077
01:35:06.718 --> 01:35:08.219
The song Revolution,

2078
01:35:08.261 --> 01:35:09.803
there are two versions of it.

2079
01:35:09.845 --> 01:35:11.306
Lennon goes back and forth on

2080
01:35:11.347 --> 01:35:13.099
"don't you know that
you can count me out"


2081
01:35:13.141 --> 01:35:15.602
as far as Revolution
is concerned.


2082
01:35:15.644 --> 01:35:19.230
Exactly where you were supposed
to stand was difficult.


2083
01:35:19.272 --> 01:35:21.316
All young people
were feeling that.


2084
01:35:21.357 --> 01:35:24.360
You know, go to a protest?
Yeah, sure.


2085
01:35:24.402 --> 01:35:29.073
Go to a protest that maybe
occupies a building? Oh, maybe.


2086
01:35:29.115 --> 01:35:31.785
You know, burning
that building down?


2087
01:35:33.495 --> 01:35:34.954

He doesn't know.

2099

He's on the fence at that point.

2100
01:36:21.959 --> 01:36:24.754
Lennon, as much as he
could be a bit handy,


2101
01:36:24.796 --> 01:36:27.716
was seduced by this
idea of peace and love.


2102
01:36:27.757 --> 01:36:30.593
He'd just written the
anthem of the previous year.


2103
01:36:30.635 --> 01:36:33.471
There always was a
kind of inherent optimism


2104
01:36:33.513 --> 01:36:34.806
in The Beatles somehow,

2105
01:36:34.848 --> 01:36:37.099
whereas that wasn't true
of Dylan,


2106
01:36:37.141 --> 01:36:40.687
it wasn't true of The Stones.

2107
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:43.147
It was almost like
Martin Luther King.


2108
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:45.567
People don't say this now

2109
01:36:45.608 --> 01:36:48.110
but there was a sense in which
a lot of the black radicals


2110
01:36:48.152 --> 01:36:52.281
who were emerging seemed
more of the moment.


2111
01:36:52.323 --> 01:36:55.451
Dr. King seemed
like kind of part


2112
01:36:55.493 --> 01:36:57.495
of the protest Establishment.

2113
01:36:57.537 --> 01:36:59.372
And in a certain way

2114
01:36:59.414 --> 01:37:01.249
The Beatles seemed a
little bit like that too.


2115
01:37:01.290 --> 01:37:04.168
[Narrator] If the band were
losing some of their relevance


2116
01:37:04.210 --> 01:37:07.589
as a cultural force through
Yoko Ono's influence,


2117
01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:11.300
John Lennon ensured that they
remained musical pioneers.


2118
01:37:11.342 --> 01:37:13.845
Where Revolution had pulled
its punches politically,


2119
01:37:13.887 --> 01:37:17.973
an experimental collage that
he created with his new partner


2120
01:37:18.015 --> 01:37:22.437
captured the chaos of 1968
simply through sound itself.


2121
01:37:22.478 --> 01:37:25.314
When it was issued on
the band's self-titled LP


2122
01:37:25.356 --> 01:37:28.276
at the close of the year,
the track Revolution 9


2123
01:37:28.317 --> 01:37:30.111
became the most widely heard

2124
01:37:30.152 --> 01:37:32.946
avant-garde composition
ever released.


2125
01:37:32.988 --> 01:37:35.450
It was a startling
statement from a man


2126
01:37:35.491 --> 01:37:36.910
who had been heralding

2127
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:39.495
in the Summer of Love
only a year beforehand.


2128
01:37:39.537 --> 01:37:42.707
He went from one
extreme to the other.


2129
01:37:42.749 --> 01:37:45.752
Lennon suddenly saw
it's all gone wrong.


2130
01:37:45.794 --> 01:37:47.629
He turned to the flip side,

2131
01:37:47.670 --> 01:37:50.632
and the flip side
was Revolution number 9,


2132
01:37:50.673 --> 01:37:53.384
Revolution 9,
which was a very,

01:38:38.763 --> 01:38:43.726
[ bombs exploding,
people screaming ]


2143
01:38:43.768 --> 01:38:48.230
This is his incredibly
honest depiction


2144
01:38:48.272 --> 01:38:50.859
of the worst fear of all

2145
01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:55.989
which is a society
and a world in global turmoil.


2146
01:38:56.029 --> 01:38:57.824
It's an extraordinary piece,

2147
01:38:57.866 --> 01:39:01.410
and one of the scariest pieces
of music you could ever hear.


2148
01:39:01.452 --> 01:39:03.371
In the 21st century,

2149
01:39:03.412 --> 01:39:07.040
Revolution 9
is far more relevant


2150
01:39:07.082 --> 01:39:08.918
than it ever was in '68.

2151
01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:12.254
[Narrator] Having delivered
the most extreme composition


2152
01:39:12.296 --> 01:39:14.007
in The Beatles' catalog,

2153
01:39:14.047 --> 01:39:16.133
Lennon's further
experimental activities


2154
01:39:16.175 --> 01:39:18.260
continued outside of the band.

2155
01:39:18.302 --> 01:39:20.262
By the end of 1968,

2156
01:39:20.304 --> 01:39:23.850
the first of a trilogy of albums
with Yoko Ono was issued -


2157
01:39:23.892 --> 01:39:27.269
Two Virgins, with a cover
depicting the couple naked.


2158
01:39:27.311 --> 01:39:29.104
Still a member of
the most popular


2159
01:39:29.146 --> 01:39:31.649
and commercially successful
act in the world,


2160
01:39:31.691 --> 01:39:34.443
Lennon was now breaking
every rule imaginable.


2161
01:39:34.485 --> 01:39:37.739
Yet the anger in some
quarters of the counterculture


2162
01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:40.115
toward the song
Revolution also led him


2163
01:39:40.157 --> 01:39:41.659
into a greater political role.

2164
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:45.663
In 1969, as Richard
Nixon was sworn in


2165
01:39:45.705 --> 01:39:47.456
as the new President of America,

2166
01:39:47.498 --> 01:39:49.417
John Lennon and Yoko Ono emerged

2167
01:39:49.458 --> 01:39:53.046
as the world's most
prominent activists.


2168
01:39:53.086 --> 01:39:55.130
When Lennon came out and said,

2169
01:39:55.172 --> 01:39:57.383
if you're talking about
destruction, count me out,


2170
01:39:57.425 --> 01:40:01.303
he was terribly criticized
by the hard Left.


2171
01:40:01.345 --> 01:40:04.265
And it seems to me that
his reaction to that


2172
01:40:04.306 --> 01:40:07.351
was not to change his
mind about destruction,


2173
01:40:07.393 --> 01:40:09.311
but actually to say,

2174
01:40:09.353 --> 01:40:12.440
"No, I really don't think
the answer is destruction.


2175
01:40:12.481 --> 01:40:15.234
I think the answer
actually is peace."


2176
01:40:15.276 --> 01:40:17.445
[Narrator] In March 1969,

2177
01:40:17.486 --> 01:40:20.073
John Lennon and Yoko
Ono were married.


2178
01:40:20.113 --> 01:40:22.241
With their honeymoon,
the couple embarked


2179
01:40:22.283 --> 01:40:24.953
on a high-profile
campaign for peace,


2180
01:40:24.994 --> 01:40:28.873
presented as a series of
conceptual art events.


2181
01:40:28.915 --> 01:40:32.043
In the spirit of The Beatles'
initial attitude to the press,


2182
01:40:32.085 --> 01:40:35.588
the first of these took place
in their hotel bridal suite,


2183
01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:37.381
in which they
invited journalists


2184
01:40:37.423 --> 01:40:40.342
to discuss politics
openly and frankly.


2185
01:40:40.384 --> 01:40:42.344
[ Yoko Ono ]
This is for world peace.


2186
01:40:42.386 --> 01:40:47.809
And we're thinking that
instead of going out and fight,


2187
01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:50.269
and make war,
something like that,


2188
01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:52.271
we should just stay in bed,

2189
01:40:52.313 --> 01:40:55.817
everybody should just stay
in bed and enjoy the spring.


2190
01:40:55.858 --> 01:40:59.152
He put his career right on
the line there for his beliefs.


2191
01:40:59.194 --> 01:41:01.823
And you have to applaud
him for that, of course.


2192
01:41:01.864 --> 01:41:05.868
It brought him an awful lot
of harassment and trouble.


2193
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:07.745
[Interviewer]
While you're in bed


2194
01:41:07.787 --> 01:41:10.957
and you're giving your press
conferences in pillow cases,


2195
01:41:10.999 --> 01:41:13.250
are you laughing at us?
- No, no.


2196
01:41:13.292 --> 01:41:15.044
No more than you're
laughing at us.


2197
01:41:15.086 --> 01:41:17.296
We have a laugh, we
think it's funny,


2198
01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:20.842
the fact that the front
page news should be the fact


2199
01:41:20.883 --> 01:41:23.302
that two people went to
bed on their honeymoon.


2200
01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:25.054
We see the funny side of it.

2201
01:41:25.096 --> 01:41:27.890
And that in Vienna, which
is a pretty square place,


2202
01:41:27.932 --> 01:41:30.018
there's all these
beautiful photographs


2203
01:41:30.059 --> 01:41:33.521
of microphones
being held to a bag,


2204
01:41:33.562 --> 01:41:35.188
to wait for the bag to speak.

2205
01:41:35.230 --> 01:41:36.649
It's rather nice.

2206
01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:39.401
But we're serious
about the peace bit.


2207
01:41:39.443 --> 01:41:42.738
Brave, foolhardy,
they were all of that.


2208
01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.740
But who else would
have done that then?


2209
01:41:44.782 --> 01:41:47.451
It would be front page
news if they were in bed,


2210
01:41:47.493 --> 01:41:49.704
talking about peace.

2211
01:41:49.745 --> 01:41:52.832
John didn't know
necessarily the ins and outs


2212
01:41:52.874 --> 01:41:54.333
of the whole Vietnam thing.

2213
01:41:54.375 --> 01:41:56.669
He and Yoko knew
that it was wrong


2214
01:41:56.711 --> 01:41:59.547
to be dropping
napalm on villages


2215
01:41:59.588 --> 01:42:01.883
and stripping the
skin off children.


2216
01:42:01.924 --> 01:42:05.594
I mean, he wasn't
wrong in that thinking.


2217
01:42:05.636 --> 01:42:08.181
He really wasn't wrong.

2218
01:42:08.221 --> 01:42:10.307
[Narrator] As the
couple's honeymoon moved


2219
01:42:10.349 --> 01:42:12.018
from Europe to Canada,

2220
01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.269
they were joined in their
hotel room by Timothy Leary,


2221
01:42:14.311 --> 01:42:17.356
Allen Ginsberg and a variety
of counterculture figures,


2222
01:42:17.398 --> 01:42:20.442
to record an anthem
for their campaign.


2223
01:42:20.484 --> 01:42:22.486
And where their
experimental records


2224
01:42:22.528 --> 01:42:25.823
and their public appearances
had left many confused,


2225
01:42:25.865 --> 01:42:27.867
this song managed to
bring their message


2226
01:42:27.909 --> 01:42:29.326
to a global audience.

2227
01:42:29.368 --> 01:42:32.371
Give Peace a Chance
was his attempt


2228
01:42:32.413 --> 01:42:36.584
to do something in his own
terms that was actually useful


2229
01:42:36.625 --> 01:42:39.128
and I think it proved to be so.

2230
01:42:39.170 --> 01:42:42.381
He wrote an anthem.
It's a simplistic anthem,


2231
01:42:42.423 --> 01:42:45.593
but it's an anthem that has a
good heart and a good message


2232
01:42:45.634 --> 01:42:48.012
and that people have
been singing ever since.

He's moved further
and further away


2242
01:43:28.136 --> 01:43:29.971
from the elegant combination

2243
01:43:30.012 --> 01:43:35.017
of artistic musical
choices and resonant text


2244
01:43:35.059 --> 01:43:39.688
into records that
only have a message.


2245
01:43:39.730 --> 01:43:43.067
He had that ability to
distill something down


2246
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:46.487
to its bare essence,
make it communicative,


2247
01:43:46.528 --> 01:43:50.032
make it unforgettable, and it
still resonates to this day.


2248
01:43:50.074 --> 01:43:52.785
[Narrator] While
Lennon pressed on


2249
01:43:52.827 --> 01:43:54.495
campaigning for peace,

2250
01:43:54.536 --> 01:43:57.248
the close of the decade saw
the first major casualties


2251
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:58.749
of the youth movement,

2252
01:43:58.791 --> 01:44:01.127
with the death of
Rolling Stone Brian Jones


2253
01:44:01.169 --> 01:44:03.254
and permanent narcotics damage

2254
01:44:03.296 --> 01:44:06.924
on both Beach Boy Brian Wilson
and Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett.


2255
01:44:06.966 --> 01:44:10.845
The utopian vision of a brave
new world was crumbling,


2256
01:44:10.886 --> 01:44:14.473
and this was reflected within
The Beatles camp itself.


2257
01:44:14.515 --> 01:44:17.350
The tensions that had
previously arisen in the studio


2258
01:44:17.392 --> 01:44:19.937
now spread into the bandmates'
own relationships


2259
01:44:19.979 --> 01:44:21.897
with each other,
and when McCartney


2260
01:44:21.939 --> 01:44:25.318
married his new partner Linda
Eastman in 1969,


2261
01:44:25.358 --> 01:44:28.654
none of his fellow Beatles
attended the ceremony.


2262
01:44:28.696 --> 01:44:31.573
As the world moved
into the 1970s,


2263
01:44:31.615 --> 01:44:34.076
Paul issued his
debut solo record


2264
01:44:34.118 --> 01:44:35.661
along with a press release

2265
01:44:35.703 --> 01:44:38.622
which announced that he
was quitting the band.


2266
01:44:38.664 --> 01:44:42.501
It was official.
The Beatles were no more.


2267
01:44:42.543 --> 01:44:45.420
The demise of the band
shocked their fans worldwide,


2268
01:44:45.462 --> 01:44:47.589
yet those close to the musicians

2269
01:44:47.631 --> 01:44:49.466
had watched them
gradually drift apart


2270
01:44:49.508 --> 01:44:52.261
over a two-year period.

2271
01:44:52.303 --> 01:44:54.429
There was no cohesion.

2272
01:44:54.471 --> 01:44:56.389
The old Liverpool bubble that
they all used to live in


2273
01:44:56.431 --> 01:44:59.018
and see each other all the
time and love each other


2274
01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:01.270
and be tolerant of
each other's foibles


2275
01:45:01.312 --> 01:45:02.897
and differences had gone.

2276
01:45:02.938 --> 01:45:04.899
So now they were spinning
off in different directions


2277
01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:09.653
with new ideas, new families,
new girlfriends, new children.


2278
01:45:09.695 --> 01:45:11.113
It just wasn't working anymore.

2279
01:45:11.155 --> 01:45:12.907
It was obvious really

2280
01:45:12.948 --> 01:45:15.617
that The Beatles as a group
had pretty much come to an end.


2281
01:45:15.659 --> 01:45:19.121
Has a multi-million
dollar entertainment act


2282
01:45:19.163 --> 01:45:24.377
ever broken up because
it wasn't fun anymore?


2283
01:45:24.417 --> 01:45:26.587
Well, we know actually

2284
01:45:26.628 --> 01:45:29.422
because so many groups
from that same period


2285
01:45:29.464 --> 01:45:31.592
continued and
continued and continued


2286
01:45:31.633 --> 01:45:34.262
when it most definitely
wasn't fun anymore.


2287
01:45:34.303 --> 01:45:36.931
The Beatles ended it
because the reasons


2288
01:45:36.972 --> 01:45:39.183
that they had
gotten into doing it


2289
01:45:39.225 --> 01:45:41.434
ceased to have value for them.

2290
01:45:41.476 --> 01:45:43.812
So they said, let's
not do this anymore.


2291
01:45:43.854 --> 01:45:48.859
That's as powerful a statement
about their integrity


2292
01:45:48.901 --> 01:45:51.153
and their intentions
and their values


2293
01:45:51.195 --> 01:45:53.239
as anything that I can think of.

2294
01:45:53.281 --> 01:45:55.741
[Narrator] In
The Beatles' wake,


2295
01:45:55.783 --> 01:45:58.077
youth culture
became more divided,


2296
01:45:58.119 --> 01:46:00.871
rock music got heavier
and more self-indulgent


2297
01:46:00.913 --> 01:46:03.498
and pop turned its
attention to glamor.


2298
01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:05.293
As for the band
members themselves,


2299
01:46:05.334 --> 01:46:07.836
despite Lennon's
continued activism


2300
01:46:07.878 --> 01:46:09.422
and string of hit singles,

2301
01:46:09.462 --> 01:46:12.258
McCartney's mainstream
triumph through his band Wings


2302
01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:14.343
and Harrison's
successful emergence


2303
01:46:14.385 --> 01:46:16.137
as an artist in his own right,

2304
01:46:16.178 --> 01:46:19.014
their impact as individuals
could never match that


2305
01:46:19.056 --> 01:46:21.142
of their Beatles glory days.

2306
01:46:21.183 --> 01:46:23.269
Yet although their
vision of utopia


2307
01:46:23.311 --> 01:46:25.104
had failed to materialize,

2308
01:46:25.146 --> 01:46:27.231
the world was still
forever changed


2309
01:46:27.273 --> 01:46:28.941
by The Beatles' innovations

2310
01:46:28.983 --> 01:46:31.235
and the values that
they represented.


2311
01:46:31.277 --> 01:46:33.904
Even if no one has ever managed
to compete with that impact,


2312
01:46:33.946 --> 01:46:37.450
with every successive
generation of musicians


2313
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:39.868
The Beatles remain the benchmark

2314
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:42.330
for how popular
entertainers can interact


2315
01:46:42.371 --> 01:46:43.956
with the wider world.

2316
01:46:43.998 --> 01:46:46.875
Did cultural and
musical changes,


2317
01:46:46.917 --> 01:46:49.003
to which they were
without any doubt


2318
01:46:49.044 --> 01:46:51.630
the largest contributors,
have a permanent effect


2319
01:46:51.672 --> 01:46:54.425
on how rock and roll
conceived itself?


2320
01:46:54.467 --> 01:46:56.093
Yeah, permanent effect

2321
01:46:56.135 --> 01:46:58.346
on how rock and roll
perceived itself.


2322
01:46:58.387 --> 01:47:02.224
So that there's even now
in this glitzy pop era,


2323
01:47:02.266 --> 01:47:06.519
pop stars see it as an option

2324
01:47:06.561 --> 01:47:10.607
that they have to
accept or refuse


2325
01:47:10.649 --> 01:47:16.113
to be conscious,
controversial...


2326
01:47:16.155 --> 01:47:19.158
and some choose one,
and others really deny it,


2327
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.994
and some are extremely bland,

2328
01:47:22.036 --> 01:47:24.830
but it's there on the table.

2329
01:47:24.872 --> 01:47:27.416
Always there on the
table, for everybody.


2330
01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:30.252
[Narrator] And as the band's
astonishing achievements


2331
01:47:30.294 --> 01:47:33.464
continue to make an impact
half a century later,


2332
01:47:33.506 --> 01:47:35.424
the legacy of The Beatles,

2333
01:47:35.466 --> 01:47:36.967
and of the remarkable decade

2334
01:47:37.009 --> 01:47:40.388
in which they flourished,
remains unrivaled.


2335
01:47:40.429 --> 01:47:43.932
The unique story of four
working class Liverpudlians


2336
01:47:43.974 --> 01:47:45.851
who changed the world.

2337
01:47:45.893 --> 01:47:47.728
[Chris] Lennon said
something along the lines of,


2338
01:47:47.769 --> 01:47:50.939
"We weren't leaders
in this world.


2339
01:47:50.981 --> 01:47:55.903
"We were just the guys on
the mast saying land ahoy.


2340
01:47:55.944 --> 01:47:58.947
We were letting you
know what we could see."


2341
01:47:58.989 --> 01:48:03.869
And without The Beatles,
understanding the '60s


2342
01:48:03.911 --> 01:48:06.539
would have been a completely
different experience.


2343
01:48:06.579 --> 01:48:08.707
They touched everything.

2344
01:48:08.749 --> 01:48:10.376
The Beatles covered it all.

2345
01:48:10.418 --> 01:48:12.253
If you want to know what
the '60s were about,


2346
01:48:12.294 --> 01:48:14.587
you listen to Beatles records.

2347
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:17.132
It tells you...
the story is there.


2348
01:48:17.174 --> 01:48:20.511
It sounds like a cliché,
but it's really impossible


2349
01:48:20.553 --> 01:48:22.513
to overstate
The Beatles' impact.


2350
01:48:22.555 --> 01:48:24.306
It sounds like
you're exaggerating,


2351
01:48:24.348 --> 01:48:26.141
and to younger people
who weren't there,


2352
01:48:26.183 --> 01:48:29.437
you know,
it just sounds ridiculous.


2353
01:48:29.478 --> 01:48:33.732
But it was true.
They changed everything.


2354
01:48:35.150 --> 01:48:36.860
