00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.610
What can I get you, bro?

3
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.910
Two packs of Marlboros,
some Sno Balls and a jumbo coke.


4
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.110
- Oh, thank you!
- You look Lovely today.


5
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.110
Hey Johnny, how are you?

6
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.910
- Hey Grabelski!
The boss is looking for you.


7
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.910
Aw, don't worry about him.

8
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.410
Grabelski!

9
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.310
- I'm going to! If I could just, I'm going to ..
- What's up boss?


10
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.110
<i>Hello,</i> Heather!

11
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.110
All right, Grabelski, what's going on here?

12
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.910
What?

13
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.810
You got another priority package for Timberline Inc.
And once again, there is a special request for you!


14
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.510
You know, you've been going over there alot lately,
you got a little something going on over there?


15
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.410
Uh, maybe...

16
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.910
- Grabelski, you're living in a dream world!
- So?


17
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.310
So! Dream on your own time
"10AM guaranteed" means 10AM, guaranteed!


18
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.110
I'll get to you after work.

19
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.610
This place gives me the "willy's"...

20
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.110
Let's make this fast.
Give them the package and get the " tip."


21
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.510
Hello...

22
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.110
Anybody home?

23
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.310
Hey, Mr. Bragdon?

24
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.110
It's me, Max.

25
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.710
And it's 10 o'clock sharp. 
Just like you said

26
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.110
Just give me that 50 dollar tip...

27
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.410
...and I'll be on my way!

28
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.810
Sir...?

29
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.710
Hey boss...

30
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.710
...where are you?

31
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.810
Hey...

32
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.410
...you in here?

33
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.810
Mmm! Boy, something smells good.

34
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.610
Hello...

35
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.610
Hey Mr. B...

36
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.710
What's cooking? Ha! ha

37
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.310
Oh God! Fire!

38
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.110
Mr. Bragdon!

39
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.610
Are you in there?

40
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.010
Are you in there?

41
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.610
- FBI, you're under arrest!
- There's a fire in there!


42
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.110
Put your hands up, Grabelski!

43
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.310
But, there's a fire in there!

44
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.010
FBI, you are under arrest!

45
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.010
You idiot!

46
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.610
Hey, I'm telling you, there
is a fire in there!

47
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.410
- Yea ...and you started it!
- I did not!


48
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.210
Alright, don't, don't, don't do anything stupid.

49
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.410
Try and stop me!

50
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.910
Hey! We're going to get you! Your mine!

51
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.610
The FBI is going
to get you , boy!

52
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.310
Freedom Express!

53
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.310
- Marty, it's me, Max.
- Grabelski, what the hell is going on with you?
There's a guy on TV says you killed somebody!


54
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.310
I know, but it's not true! I didn't do it!
I was set up!


55
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.710
A set-up? What are you talking about?

56
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.310
I got to know, if there is another package for Timberline Inc!
For Reinhardt Bragdon!


57
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.310
What the hell does
Reinhardt Bragdon got to do with anything?


58
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.710
Because, that's the guy I killed!

59
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.610
Oh, so you did kill somebody!

60
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.310
No! I told you, I was framed!
<i>-Marty, the package!</i>


61
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.510
All right, all right.

62
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.010
We believe the murderer
is a man, named Max Grabelski.


63
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:29.310
The motive is robbery. A million dollars of old money,
which was scheduled to be taken out of circulation has been recovered.


64
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.410
Mr. Bragdon, who's job it was to destroy this old currency,
uncovered the crime and he was murdered for it.


65
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.110
Marty! Marty!

66
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.310
His body was burned beyond recognition and
we had to identify him using only his teeth.


67
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.610
- It was gross, I'm telling you.
It was really, really gross!


68
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.910
Marty!

69
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.310
Marty!

70
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.810
Your in luck. I found it.

71
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.310
It says, it is supposed to be
delivered on Monday.


72
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.610
That's three days. Same address?

73
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.310
No, it says this package is going to
some place called ...Devil's Peak?


74
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.710
That's up in the mountains.

75
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.910
Mountains?

76
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.610
Who the hell goes to the mountains?

77
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.610
Come on guys! Keep climbing.
We're almost there!


78
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.510
I'm slipping, Gordy!
I'm scared!


79
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.810
Don't worry, Fishman. I got you.

80
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.810
This reminds me of the time
I scaled Kilimanjaro!


81
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.310
We're going to make it!
We're going to make it!


82
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.110
Hey, can I play, too?

83
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.610
Kid, go home!

84
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.710
We're not playing, we're practicing.

85
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.610
You guys are silly.

86
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.110
Hey, Troop 12,
your scout leader's here!


87
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.610
Hi mom...

88
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.610
Hi guys...

89
00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.610
Hey, go on inside. We have a new project.
We're going to get our cooking badges.


90
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.410
Pudding!

91
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:14.110
Gordy, you're suppose to get your cooking badge,
by roasting a porcupine with a magnifying glass!


92
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.910
This is Home Ec!

93
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.210
Hey, check it out!
Lynn Straders in her underwear!


94
00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.310
Let me see!

95
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.410
Oh, sorry! She just ducked
behind the Kligman's house


96
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.910
Barnhill, you're such a liar!

97
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.310
You're such a shrimp!

98
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.310
Take that back!

99
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.110
Make me shrimp!

100
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.410
- Liar!

101
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.810
Oh, that hurt alot!

102
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.010
It says here that mini-marshmallows in
chocolate pudding, creates a visual feast.


103
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.310
Aah! He's crazy!

104
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.910
For our fire badge, we had
a weenie roast in your backyard!


105
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.610
Give her a break, Ralph, ok?

106
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.910
We've been giving her
a break for six months!


107
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.410
Hey, hey. What's
going on in here?


108
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.110
Come on. Settle down guys.

109
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.610
I have a surprise for you.

110
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.310
- Another surprise!
- Don't worry. It'll get better.


111
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.810
It can't get worse.

112
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.910
Guys...

113
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.110
I'd like you to meet Kelsey Jordan.
She's the newest member of the troop.


114
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.910
What troop?

115
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.610
Our troop, dear.

116
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.110
Ranger Scouts are for guys.

117
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.810
Yeah. Guys in aprons!

118
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:34.810
<i>- Ranger Scouts.</i>
Yes. Um ..can I rent a Scout Leader?


119
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.910
<i>Step away from the vehicle!</i>
<i>You are too close to the vehicle!</i>


120
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.110
Got your keys?

121
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.610
Yes.

122
00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.810
Good!

123
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.210
I hate to do this, but...

124
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.910
Hey, mister!

125
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.910
I got to make a dookie.

126
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.810
I got to make a dookie!

127
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.210
My mom says that the guy who is taking us,
has hiked all over the world!


128
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:35.110
He won't be half as good as the guide
me and my dad had in the Serengeti.


129
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.610
Barnhill, if your dad is so freakin cool,
then why isn't he our scout leader?


130
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.910
Oh Yeah!
Spies have a lot of time for scouts


131
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.610
Pills, pills! Stay in the front seat.

132
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.110
Air bag, son.
Air bag.


133
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.110
Hey, where's Dana?

134
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.310
His dad wouldn't sign his permission slip,
says he isn't big enough to go.


135
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.410
Parents!

136
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.107
- Nice dolls!

137
00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.610
- Did you bring a pretty pink umbrella
in case it starts to rain?


138
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.810
No, I figured we could all just crouch under
a pair of your underwear and wait it out!


139
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.110
- Oh rejected! Ha! ha!

140
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.110
Ok. Everybody buckle up!

141
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.710
Bye!...

142
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.810
Wait !!!

143
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.110
Please wait!

144
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.110
Dana, what are you doing here, honey?
I thought your dad said you couldn't come.


145
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.910
He changed his mind.
Here, my permission slip.


146
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.710
Well, good for you.

147
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.110
Good job, Dana!
We're going on a real overnight now!


148
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.910
This guy, Patterson?
Did he really kill a mountain lion?


149
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.110
That's what they said...

150
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.310
He climbed K2 with a broken ankle?...

151
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.610
Yep, he saved ten people from an avalanche.

152
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.410
I can't wait to meet this guy!

153
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.510
Where the heck am I?

154
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.110
Handi-capped ...huh?

155
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.110
Hey there...

156
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.010
Need a little information.

157
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.110
They're talking about the guy
who killed that banker.


158
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.610
Police have released photos...

159
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.410
Excuse me!

160
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.510
I'm looking for a place called Devils Peak.

161
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.510
Devils Peak?

162
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.410
Mmm... the turn-off is a couple miles north.

163
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.110
But, that's a tough climb. What kind
of a car you driving?


164
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.410
The one parked in the handi-capped zone!

165
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.610
"I am an inconsiderate person"

166
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.010
Hey, Sergeant Doofus, did you paste
that note to my window?


167
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.610
That's right, cupcake!
A little lesson in common decency.


168
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.310
What?

169
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:34.110
Sure, it'll be a little trouble getting it off, just like the trouble you would
have caused some handi-capped person had they needed to pull in here and relieve themselves!

170
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.110
Hey, hey! I just heard on the TV, that
Mad Max is heading this way.


171
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.410
He's driving a stolen Volvo.

172
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.610
A blue Volvo station ...wagon.

173
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.110
coming this...

174
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.110
All right! Freeze!

175
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.110
Take it easy!

176
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.810
Now, you are going to pretend to me.

177
00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.910
Give yourself up, boy?

178
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.910
Give me that glue!

179
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.410
You still got a chance to
be a fine young scout!


180
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.610
Where is that glue!?

181
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:05.910
Top pocket!

182
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:09.510
Put your palms up!

183
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.810
- OK. Grab a hold of the wheel!
- Are you nuts?


184
00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.310
I said, grab the wheel!

185
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.110
Come on! I have a gun for chrissakes!

186
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.610
You're going to pay for this, mister.

187
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.610
Now, put your chin there.

188
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.910
- You do know this stuff is permanent!
- Do it!


189
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.910
Hey, I can't drive like this!

190
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.810
Just keep driving south.
Don't stop driving until you get to MÃ©xico!


191
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.910
I'll be right behind you the whole time!

192
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.310
Don't try any funny stuff or
I'll blow your butt off. Got it?


193
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.610
Got it: Keep driving, no
funny stuff, blow butt off.

194
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.410
Right.

195
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.610
Looks like this guy is a no-show...

196
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.910
Maybe he's picking up
some special gear or something.


197
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.310
Get out of the way!

198
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.010
What is this a parade?

199
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.210
Would you move your wrinkled asses?
I'm in a hurry here!


200
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.510
Yea, I am going to run you over...

201
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.410
Gotcha!

202
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:52.610
I swear to God, I don't know how it happened!
It's all a big mistake!


203
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.910
You got to believe me! I'm sorry!

204
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.010
I'm so sorry!

205
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.010
Don't be so hard on your self?

206
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.410
So you're a little late...

207
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.610
I'm sure the kids
are still raring to go.

208
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.110
Wait a minute.
Here we go, guys!


209
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.310
I found him!

210
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.410
You guys, we're going on an overnight!

211
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.810
Yeah !!!

212
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.310
They're all yours.

213
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:45.610
Mine?

214
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.410
One at a time, please.
One at a time.


215
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.110
Whoa, check out the hiking shoes!
What kind are those?


216
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.610
They're, uh ...Italian!

217
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.010
Must be those new
hydro moons I've heard about.

218
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:10.410
Ok, settle down guys. I'm sure that Scout Leader Erickson will
answer the rest of your questions right around the campfire.


219
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:11.610
Scout Leader?

220
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.310
Can you tell us about the
time you soloed the big E!

221
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.610
Yeah, tell us!

222
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.610
The time I what?

223
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.610
- Climbed Mount Everest.
- Tell us. Please...


224
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.610
Everest? Uh...

225
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.110
Well...

226
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.310
It was a bitch!

227
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.610
Oh, let me tell you.
Them Alps ...they can get pretty..


228
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.310
...steep!

229
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.310
I would imagine they could.

230
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.110
I thought Mount Everest was in the Himalayas.

231
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.110
- Huh?
- Yea, she's right!


232
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.410
Yeah. Oh, yeah! Yes....But uh ...

233
00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.310
I had to cross
the Alps to get there.

234
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.410
The man's a God.

235
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.210
Wow. That's quite a hike!

236
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.510
Oh ho! ha! ha!

237
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.610
Let's get our stuff together.

238
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.810
It's time for our sleepover in the woods.

239
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.310
Sleepover in the woods?

240
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.110
I'm Aggie Patterson. Hi.

241
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:27.710
I just wanted to say, that I think it's wonderful thing, that a
man of your achievement has taken the time for the youth of America.

242
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.610
Wh ...ha ...whew?

243
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.910
(exhales!)

244
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.910
Oh. And Mr. Erickson.
I like to keep the kids ...gum free.


245
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:03.110
Thank you.

246
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.610
Well, sir.
Off you go!


247
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.110
Hey, sir? Can we make smores?

248
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.110
- Cause I brought graham crackers...
- What the hell am I doing here?


249
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.010
- Can you teach me how to whittle?

250
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.410
Bye...

251
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.310
Hey...

252
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.610
How come you didn't bring a pack, sir?

253
00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.810
What do you mean...

254
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.910
In fact. I brought two.

255
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.110
Who's got a light?

256
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.510
I do.

257
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.110
You're not going to leave that
on the floor, are you?


258
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.110
Your right.

259
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.610
Got to cover my tracks!

260
00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:58.110
What's he doing?

261
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.810
Alright, bunk 12...

262
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.610
I want you to walk.

263
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:16.910
I want you to walk away from here and
walk to where ever it was you were going.


264
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:28.110
And I will disappear. Into the jungle. And from a safe distance,
I will evaluate your walking skills


265
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.310
- Oh?
- Alright.


266
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.610
Alright, walk. Walk away.

267
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.310
Bye, bye!

268
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.010
Looking good!

269
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.810
Ok.
I'm out of here.


270
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.610
Guys, stand up straight.
Remember, he's watching.


271
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.110
Help! Help me!

272
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.110
Help! Help!

273
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.110
- Mr. Erickson!

274
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.310
Would it be all right,
if we called you "Spider"?


275
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.310
Why the hell would you
want to call me that?


276
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.910
Because, it's your nickname?

277
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.110
Well fine then. 
Call me "Spider."

278
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.310
Spider. Spider... Spider!

279
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.610
WHAT!

280
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.810
How come your nickname is Spider?

281
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:05.110
Because, I once killed a kid, who called
me Spider one time too many!


282
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:13.110
How could they call you Spider one time too many,
if your nickname wasn't already Spider?


283
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.110
Spider! Spider! Spider!

284
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.610
Grabelski, put your hands up
and step out of the vehicle!


285
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:39.810
I can't!

286
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.310
I repeat: Put your hands up
and step out of the vehicle!


287
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.410
And I repeat: I can't!
You've got the wrong guy!


288
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.110
You don't come out, peacefully, we
are going to take you out by force!


289
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:54.110
No, no! Wait!
Wait!


290
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.310
I'm glued ..!

291
00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.110
AHH !!!

292
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:07.110
This is it? We finally go on an overnight
and we end up at Gran Central Station?


293
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.110
It's better then my back yard.

294
00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:10.410
Not by much.

295
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.110
Let's show Spider, we know
what we are doing.


296
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.710
Where is Spider, anyway?

297
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.610
Ahh! Help me!

298
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.610
They're eating me alive!

299
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.310
Here. Try my bug repellent.

300
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.610
Oh, Good!

301
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.310
Thank you.
That's good.


302
00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:58.810
That's a little Tangy. 
[Throwing up...]

303
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:03.310
The manual says,
"Always find level ground to pitch your tent on."


304
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.410
Let's do that.

305
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.110
Too bad we can't go to Coyote Flats.
That's only two miles.


306
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.610
And Red Rock Bluff is only 4 miles, but I guess
that's kind of far for a little Miss Ranger Scout.


307
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:18.610
Oh yea, I could get all the way to Devils Peak and back
before you could get your compass out!


308
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.710
Oh right, seriously.

309
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:20.910
Devils Peak?

310
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.110
How do you know about Devils Peak?

311
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.310
Um ....its there ..

312
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.610
right behind your head.

313
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.110
"Devils Peak"

314
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.310
I don't know , sir.
Looks like a pretty tough climb.


315
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:39.110
It says class six. That means
only the most experienced climbers


316
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.110
How tough could it be? 
It's this far!

317
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:44.810
What are you guys?
A bunch of Tenderfoots?


318
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.310
Not yet ,sir. We need six more badges.

319
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.610
Badges?

320
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.510
Well let me tell you how you are
going to get those badges!


321
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.310
By matching your wits against that mountain!

322
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:04.110
By taking everything that bad boy has to offer
and getting good old Max to where he needs to go.


323
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.510
Who's Max?

324
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.210
Max?

325
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:11.110
Who's Max?

326
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:21.610
Max ...is all of us! Because we are
going to push ourselves to the max!


327
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:22.910
YEA!

328
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.610
- Are you with me?
- YEA!


329
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.910
To Devils Peak?

330
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.910
- To Devils Peak!
- All right! Let's go!


331
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.410
Officer, Officer...

332
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.310
What's happening with the children?

333
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.310
Ma'am, I don't know.
You just have to wait for the Feds.


334
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.310
What Feds? What's going on?

335
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.110
- I don't know.
- Somebody must know?


336
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.310
What the hell gave you the right
to take away my little Dana?


337
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.610
Mr. Jareki, he had a permission slip,
like everybody else!


338
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.310
Come on lady, you can't tell the difference
between my signature and a little ten year old's?


339
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.610
Dana!

340
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.110
Dana!

341
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.710
Who's Agatha Patterson?

342
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.010
I am.

343
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:13.810
Excuse me sweetheart, is this
the man you think took the kids?


344
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.110
Yes, it is.

345
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.310
We've got a fugitive
on the loose here, people.


346
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:29.310
He is armed, he is dangerous.
And he's got himself some hostages.


347
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.710
What are you talking about!
Help Aggie! Aggie? Help!


348
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.910
- What are you doing!
- Oh Dear me! Somebody get her some water!


349
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.310
This Scout is ready. 
Now let's get going?

350
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.310
Ready for what?
We're going after this guy alone.


351
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:54.910
Trust me G-man. You don't take me, you
won't get within 2000 vertical feet of this guy


352
00:26:55.110 --> 00:27:03.610
Listen pal, I know this Grabelski. And I'm just as good in the woods
as he is. And I don't have six little hostages slowing me down.


353
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.910
Without me ...you got no chance.

354
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.910
Ok. You come along.

355
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.710
Just remember one thing:

356
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:21.810
I call the shots. You ..
just do the tracking.


357
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:26.910
Are we there yet?

358
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.110
Spider, are you alright?

359
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.110
Fishman, give me a match.

360
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.810
One second. I'm working on
my bird-watching badge.


361
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.110
I see a scrub jay and a nuthatch
and a SWAT team!


362
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:45.510
What?

363
00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:46.710
Police ...lots of them!

364
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.110
- Oh boy! Oh boy!

365
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.110
I've got to hide!

366
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.910
We have got to hide!

367
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.210
You mean wilderness survival?

368
00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:06.910
Right!

369
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.210
Come on! Come on! We've got to
make up ground while we still got the light.


370
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.110
- See anything?
- Not yet, sir.


371
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.110
Spider, shouldn't we be on a regular trail?

372
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.510
Kid, ...questions like that
could get us killed.


373
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.310
- A little cooler than my mom, huh?
- Oh, yeah!


374
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:46.210
What?

375
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.810
What?

376
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.310
What? What? What? What?

377
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:53.910
Spider, look!

378
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.510
That's the big deal?

379
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.310
It's Winnie the Pooh!

380
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:08.910
Hey, Boo Boo.

381
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.710
What's the matter? You lost?

382
00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.110
No collar, must be a stray.

383
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.210
Spider, I don't think that's a good idea.

384
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:21.110
Oh relax. He's a pussycat.

385
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.110
Uh, Spider, maybe you shouldn't.

386
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.610
Come on. Give me your paw.

387
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.410
He's sucking my thumb!

388
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.410
That's not the one I saw.

389
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.510
What?

390
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.610
That' not the one I saw!!!

391
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.810
Nice kitty!

392
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.310
My God, he's dead!

393
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:35.910
No, no he's not dead! It says in the manual. When you
are attacked by a bear, you are suppose to play dead.


394
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.210
Whoa, he's a monster!

395
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.610
Ohh ... that's not good!

396
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.110
Spider!

397
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:21.310
I must say, that was an awesome demonstration
of how to handle a bear attack!


398
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.410
Spider?

399
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.410
What's he doing?

400
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.510
- Spider?
- Wake him up!


401
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.110
Auntie EM?

402
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:36.610
What happened?

403
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.110
You were attacked by a giant grizzly bear!

404
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.310
Oh, but you played dead like a genius!

405
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.810
Yea, it was incredible!

406
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:44.610
Of course I did!

407
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.410
And I do not want to have to show
you guys that one again, ok?


408
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.610
Alright, now let's move out! Come on.

409
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.410
Move. Get out of here.
March on. March away!


410
00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:58.910
March...

411
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.510
I'm alive !!!

412
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.310
Little tougher than the StairMaster,
eh, G-man? Heh.


413
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.610
Hey. Listen, iron balls.
You take your time!


414
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:28.110
I know guys like this Grabelski,
when the pressure's on, they crack.


415
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.910
Scouts chanting to the tune of " Sound Off."
We sing and sing  'cause that's our thing.


416
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.610
You know this song will never end.
Cause when it's done we start again.


417
00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.810
1, 2, 3, 4.

418
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.610
We're Troop 12, the scouts' top crew.
We're honest, kind, and real fun, too.


419
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.310
We yell hurrah, we yell hooray.
We run and dance and sing and play.


420
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.610
We do good deeds, we help our friends...

421
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.810
Alright!
Knock it off!


422
00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.610
What is that?
"We run and dance and sing and play"?


423
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.610
My mom kind of wrote the words.

424
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.310
Well, they suck! OK.

425
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.410
What?!

426
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.410
I got to pee, I got to pee!

427
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.310
So who's stopping you?

428
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.810
30 years of scouting tells me,
we've made up a good chunk of ground.


429
00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.610
Hey! Ah, ha ha!

430
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.610
Oh, that's the ticket!
A little spritz of cool clean mountain rain!


431
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.110
Shake your lizard.
Let it drain!


432
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.910
Move your hips
and spell your name!


433
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.310
Send it straight
and send it hard.,


434
00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.310
Now a sword fight.
Go! En garde!


435
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.610
I got some bad news for you, Palmer.

436
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.110
That ain't rain.

437
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.110
Eat your veggies.
Eat your starches,


438
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:56.110
Lean back, boys!
Golden arches!


439
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.510
Whew. Alright.

440
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.310
Now, flip 'em and zip 'em
and let's get moving.


441
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.610
- Hey. You. Don't move!

442
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.810
Spider, we just pissed on some guy's head!

443
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.110
- You!

444
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.810
Oh, fu...dge!

445
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:14.610
Run!

446
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.510
Running badge time!

447
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:26.310
Come on!

448
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.310
Let's get vertical!

449
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.610
Wait. You expect me to climb
up there with just my hands?


450
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.910
That's right doughboy!
That's how it's done.


451
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.410
Hey, how about when you get up there,
you throw me down a ladder?


452
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.410
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

453
00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.110
[Palmer]
I think I pulled something.


454
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.110
Come on G-man!
They're getting away.


455
00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:04.610
Come on! Come on!

456
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.210
Put your left hand on the rock,
higher above your head.


457
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.610
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get going!


458
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.910
Spider, are you sure that bridge is safe?

459
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:28.510
Why, what's the matter, you scared?

460
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:33.110
Let me tell you something, honey:

461
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.310
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

462
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.410
Spider, I'm afraid, too!

463
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.610
Shut up, you gutless worm,
I'm talking to her!


464
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.110
Put your right foot up there!

465
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.810
Put the right .. No, the left!
Your feet are crossed! His feet are crossed.


466
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.410
Come on, we can't just stand here,
we gotta move!


467
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:56.310
I'll go first.

468
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.810
You will?

469
00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.110
Let's go!

470
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.010
All of you, move it.
Come on!


471
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.210
Hey guys...

472
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.210
It's easy!

473
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.910
Jeez, Gordy!
Quit goofing around!


474
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.910
Gordy, you ok?

475
00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:27.410
- We gotta move faster, man, come on!
- No!


476
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.110
Safety first. We got to go slow.

477
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.110
Safety?

478
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.410
Safety first.

479
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.210
I'll be right back!

480
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:43.610
Keep going!

481
00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.910
Come on man! They're getting away!

482
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.910
- Help me up.
- How much do you weigh?


483
00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.110
This guy weighs a damn ton!

484
00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.310
Oh, no!

485
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:12.510
Run!

486
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:15.410
Run!

487
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:18.810
Go!

488
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.510
Run!

489
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.610
Run! Run!
Go, go, go!


490
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.110
Go, go, go!

491
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.110
Move it, come on!

492
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.110
Faster, you little...!

493
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.610
Move it, come on, keep going!

494
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.110
Go!

495
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.810
Run!

496
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.610
Spider? Sir?

497
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.110
Fishman?

498
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:04.410
We got them!

499
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.910
Fishman, get over here!

500
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.610
I can't! I'm having a little vertigo!

501
00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:11.910
I'm stuck!

502
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.110
I don't believe it!

503
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.810
Spider! Are you nuts?

504
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.410
Maybe, I am.

505
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.110
Now, get over here!

506
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.610
Stay with me, G-man!
Stay with me!


507
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.110
Alright, here we go!

508
00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.110
Goodbye, Grabelski!

509
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.310
Hello, one million!

510
00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:41.410
Don't you dare!
There's a scout on that bridge!


511
00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.010
Come on!

512
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.510
Get over here !!!

513
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.410
You may find this hard to believe,
but I am a little bit of a coward!


514
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:57.110
You are not a coward! You are
Milton Fishman, the superstud!


515
00:38:59.010 --> 00:38:59.710
What?

516
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:05.110
Say that. Say ..
"I'm Milton Fishman, the superstud!"


517
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.610
It will give you courage.

518
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:13.610
"I'm Milton Fishman, superstud"
I'm Milton Fishman, superstud!


519
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.610
It's not working.

520
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:16.910
eww oof...!

521
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.310
Alright!
That's it, Fishman.


522
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.610
Last thread.

523
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.210
It's been nice knowing you.

524
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.410
I'm Milton Fishman, superstud !!!

525
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:36.310
That's it!

526
00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:39.310
Come on!

527
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:42.710
Come on!

528
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:45.710
Yeah!

529
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.410
Spider, I did it! 
I really did it!

530
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:50.710
I'm proud of you!

531
00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.110
Now, Get the hell out of here!

532
00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.810
Well, tracker man!
What do we do now?


533
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.110
We got no choice.

534
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.110
Got to go around.

535
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:41.510
All right! Everybody stay calm.

536
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.810
We have no good news as of yet.

537
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.510
- Will you please be quiet
and let him speak?


538
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.610
And no news... No.

539
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:52.310
"No news ... is no news!

540
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.510
unless it's good news.

541
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.910
but we have no news, so...

542
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:00.610
Good!

543
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:05.910
Spider...

544
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:08.210
I'm getting hungry!

545
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.510
Could we stop for a rest!

546
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.910
Wouldn't it be best if we
camped here for the night?


547
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:20.110
Alright, I guess
we bought ourselves some time.


548
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.110
Bought ourselves time for what?

549
00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:29.310
Well, guys, we got to start a fire.

550
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.610
Better start looking for pinecones.

551
00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.610
Pinecones?

552
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:44.610
It says in the manual, whenever your camp is surrounded
by green wood, always use pinecones to start your fire.


553
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:50.510
If the manual told you to stick your weiner
in a light socket, would you do it?


554
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:55.610
Check this thing out! It's huge!

555
00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:56.810
Mine's huger!

556
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.910
Hey, guy's, there's lots
of them up here!


557
00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.610
Look at this baby!
Big as a football!


558
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.110
Hit me, hit me!

559
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:09.810
Go, go!

560
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:10.810
Alright!

561
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:15.010
4, 44! ... 4, 44!

562
00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:16.610
To me, Spider!

563
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.610
Red dog! Red dog!
Hut! Hut! Hut!...


564
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:22.110
Deep!

565
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.910
Way back! Way back...

566
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.610
Nobody is open!

567
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.310
He's going to have to run it!

568
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.910
I don't think that's a pinecone...

569
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.310
Oh, Mother...

570
00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:51.910
Ayyy !!!

571
00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:59.910
You haven't had one of those seizures
for about 20 minutes, that's a good sign!


572
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:02.510
How does that feel?

573
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.610
Ahh, that's good!
That's good. Ahh!


574
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.610
He didn't know the difference
between a beehive and a pinecone?


575
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.910
What are you thinking?

576
00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.610
I don't know yet...

577
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.110
Davy Crockett, did you catch anything yet?

578
00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:30.510
That's right. Make jokes.
That's what's wrong with this country,


579
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.110
everybody wants it now.

580
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:36.110
Nobody, is willing to hunt down,
what they really need.


581
00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.710
That's what I try to teach my kids.

582
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.510
To hunt down the goodness in life.

583
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:54.610
You might say, "I'm the thin tacky line
between morality and depravity."


584
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:56.310
And friend,

585
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:01.110
there's no telling what kind of depravity,
Grabelski, is up to right now.


586
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.110
Here we go. Here we go.

587
00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:17.810
Hey...

588
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.610
I got the tent up!

589
00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:23.510
What are you working on?

590
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.310
It's a crystal diode receiver.

591
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.310
You know what that is, right?

592
00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.610
Yes, of course I do.

593
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:31.910
Oh, yes...

594
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:33.910
That is a beauty.

595
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:36.310
That's the toolbox.

596
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:39.010
Well...

597
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:45.610
Guys!

598
00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.410
Look what I got!

599
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:49.910
Whoa! What is this!

600
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.110
Bet you never seen anything
like that before huh, Barnhill?


601
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.110
Probably don't know anything
about the birds and the bees! Butthead.


602
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.710
Oh, and you do?

603
00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.610
Yeah, that's right, I do.

604
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:00.910
Oh, yeah?

605
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.410
Well, than explain it to us?

606
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.110
Well, I...

607
00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.110
I know it's about making babies...

608
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.610
And that it takes
a man and a woman...

609
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:15.810
to make it work right...

610
00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.310
and that they both
have to go in a room...


611
00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.110
and they both take their shirts off...

612
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.110
No, no, no! The man doesn't
have to take his shirt off!


613
00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:29.610
Just the woman!

614
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:31.810
Oh...

615
00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.110
Hey!

616
00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.810
What have you kids got there?

617
00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:36.110
Give me that!

618
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.610
You guys shouldn't be looking at this!

619
00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:46.610
Spider?

620
00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.810
Could you tell us about
the birds and the bees?


621
00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.610
I don't think I'm really
the right person to...uh


622
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:05.410
It says in the manual that, the Scout Leader
is suppose to tell us about that kind of stuff!


623
00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:08.410
Really?

624
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:10.810
Yea, really!

625
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:12.810
Yep.

626
00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.610
Well, if it says in the manual...

627
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:19.910
All right...

628
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:32.910
Hey, let me borrow your dollies, honey.

629
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.310
Ok.

630
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:47.910
Once upon a time, there was a man dolly
and there was a lady dolly.


631
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.310
And they fell in Love.

632
00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.610
Tonight, on EyeWitness America,

633
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:01.110
Scout's Honor - the hostage crisis. Day one.

634
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.610
Oh my ...my.
Our son's a hostage.


635
00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:10.610
Let me tell you something:
Whatever he is going through right now,
I'm holding you personally responsible!


636
00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.610
Work it, baby! Work it!
Oh, that's good! Oh!


637
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:17.610
That's it, oh, right there.
Oh, that's good! Hee. Hee. Ha. Ha.


638
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.410
OH! OH! OH! That's it.
Whoa! Oh, Yea!


639
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:26.110
Oh, that's how Daddy likes it!
Hee. Hee. Hee. Hee.


640
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:33.110
Everybody start your engines.
Aaaa oooh ga!


641
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:43.110
Then, the man has a cigarette, watches
a little Leno ...and goes to sleep.


642
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:46.910
Any questions?

643
00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:53.810
Hey, guys! Come on. I got one:

644
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:58.110
OK, what if a blizzard came in and
everybody else died...


645
00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:04.610
Now, you can either starve to death or
you could eat the frozen bodies and live?


646
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.810
- I'd eat the bodies!
- But you'd eat anything!


647
00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.110
I'd eat the bodies,
I'd probably eat the bodies...


648
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:12.610
Not your body, but I might
take a chomp on you...


649
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.310
Hey Spider. You do one.

650
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:16.810
Me?

651
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:19.810
Let me see...

652
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:22.610
Alright.

653
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:28.210
What would you do
if you were a delivery guy...


654
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:29.310
Ok...

655
00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:35.110
your down to your last package and you pull up
to the house and it's a huge mansion...


656
00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:37.110
I mean the biggest house you ever saw!

657
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.110
You ring the bell, the door opens,

658
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:43.410
and there's this sharp
looking guy in a suit.

659
00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:48.110
And he pulls you inside and he says:

660
00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:52.110
Today, is your lucky day!

661
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.110
I got a deal I
want to make with you.

662
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.310
I've got six packages coming to me,
over the next three weeks.


663
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:04.610
If you can deliver them at 10 o'clock sharp,
when it is dark,


664
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.110
I will give you 50 dollars a package.

665
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.410
- Sounds weird...
- No, sounds pretty cool!


666
00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.910
So you say to the guy:
What's in the package?


667
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:15.810
He says: I can't tell.

668
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.710
Because, both of our lives
might be in danger.


669
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:20.110
This is a good one!

670
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:24.110
Now, part of you knows, there's
something fishy going on here ...


671
00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:31.910
but the other part of you is thinking, this
secret package stuff, might be kind of exciting...


672
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.010
Kind of like a spy, or something!

673
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:41.610
I mean, ...being a delivery guy,
that can get kinda boring!


674
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:48.110
Anyway, the guy takes a real 50 dollar bill
and he slaps in your hand.


675
00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.610
And he says to you: Are you in?

676
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:53.910
Now, what do you do?

677
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:56.610
Do you take the deal?

678
00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:58.110
It sounds like a set-up.

679
00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:59.310
And illegal.

680
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.110
And the guy sounds like a total criminal.

681
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.110
- Do you know him at all?
- No.


682
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.310
- Does any one go with you? Are there any witnesses?
- No...


683
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:13.110
- Is there any way of protecting yourself, so you're
not blindly walking into a trap?
- No...


684
00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:15.910
Only a sucker would fall for that...

685
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.810
or a stupid!

686
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:17.710
Or a moron!

687
00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:18.610
Or an idiot.

688
00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.110
Or a sleazeball.

689
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.510
Spider, do another one...
that one was way too easy.


690
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.510
I'm going to hit the hay...

691
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.410
Ok, I'll do one.

692
00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:48.810
Yes!

693
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.810
Can you really hear anything?

694
00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:53.810
The thoughts and prayers
of the entire country...


695
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.210
Ah, religious program.

696
00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.110
... remain with Scout Troop 12.

697
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.110
Hey, that ...that's us!

698
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.110
Why are they talking
about us on the radio?


699
00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:04.310
...who are being held hostage
by a psychotic murderer!


700
00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:06.410
Spider?

701
00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:10.510
His name's not Spider,
it's "Mad Max Grabelski"!


702
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:26.510
- It's him.
- Oh, no!


703
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:40.910
Guys, quiet!

704
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:43.110
Oh God, we are trapped with a killer!

705
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:44.410
A psycho killer!

706
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.010
I don't think they
even cover that in here!


707
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.610
Come on, we're Scouts, Remember?
Let's act like it!


708
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:53.110
We're all going to die!

709
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.610
Let me at him! I'll bust him up!
I'll handle him myself!


710
00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:00.210
Are you crazy? You midget? We're dead.
There're never going to find us up here!


711
00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:01.910
We'll take care of that.

712
00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:05.110
Hurry up, Fish!

713
00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.310
"H" is two longs and one short.

714
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.410
No, no. Stop. Stop. Wait!
Two shorts and one long.


715
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:17.110
Oh, Great, what are we supposed to do?
Cross that letter out?


716
00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.810
God bless those little scouts!

717
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.610
What? What do you see?
What do you see?


718
00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.210
Smoke signals, right by the book.

719
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:32.910
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, almost.


720
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:34.610
Well, what do they say?

721
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.310
"Belp", "Belp."

722
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:42.110
Ok, here we go.

723
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:44.210
Some allergy medicine,

724
00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:49.110
some cough syrup,

725
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.910
and some sleeping pills.

726
00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:57.910
Are you sure it's
going to knock him out?


727
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:02.310
One sip, and he's Sleeping Beauty.

728
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:05.110
Ok guys, we got a lot
of ground to cover today.


729
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:07.010
Oh, God, this had better work.

730
00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:09.710
Spider?

731
00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:16.410
Come on, Fishman, you can do it.

732
00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:20.210
- Make sure he drinks the whole thing.
- Don't be scared.


733
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:26.710
Spider!

734
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:29.210
Hi, hello there?

735
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.010
Want a drink?

736
00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:35.910
No.

737
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:38.310
But you're thirsty now. I can see it!

738
00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:40.210
Fishman! I don't want a drink!

739
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:46.010
What do think, Gordy?
Doesn't Spider look a little ...parched?


740
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:47.110
Yeah.

741
00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:49.310
Give me the canteen.

742
00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.410
That is good!

743
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.510
Woo! Thank you!

744
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:28.110
I feel good!

745
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:29.710
Sleeping beauty, huh?

746
00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:31.310
Come on guys, keep up!

747
00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:34.410
Everybody now!
We come proud, the Cub Scout Troop!


748
00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:36.110
Ow! Ow!

749
00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:38.610
I ...I sprained my ankle!

750
00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:40.110
Come on, Ralph!

751
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:44.910
Come on, shake it off.

752
00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:46.310
Use the other one.

753
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.510
I think I sprained mine, too, Mr. Grabelski.

754
00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:56.810
What did you call me?

755
00:55:01.610 --> 00:55:11.610
I called you ...Polinski. I had a Dr. Polinski once.
I don't know why you suddenly reminded me of him.


756
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:18.010
He treated me for cryptorchidism ...
...Undescended left testicle.


757
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.110
Funny! I can feel it going
back up there right now.


758
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:25.910
No.

759
00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:28.510
You called me, Grabelski.

760
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:30.910
How did you know my name?

761
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:32.110
Oh, God...

762
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:34.210
How did you know my name?

763
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:37.610
I want some answers !!!

764
00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:41.110
Please don't kill us, Mad Max!

765
00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:53.910
- We caught, Mad Max!
He's over here!


766
00:55:54.110 --> 00:56:00.110
Well, what do you know! I'll take six
Ranger Scouts over one Federal man, anyday!


767
00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:03.110
They captured, Grabelski!

768
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:04.610
I didn't do any thing!

769
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:07.010
We're not feeling sorry
for you, you're a murderer!

770
00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:09.610
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm innocent.


771
00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:10.910
Well done, youths!
Ha. Ha!


772
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.110
I'm Agent Palmer, FBI.

773
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:17.710
I thought there were two of you?

774
00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:21.010
No, uh, ..only me.

775
00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:30.310
All right. All right. All right. You're all heroes ...
everyone of you. Very, very, very wonderful.


776
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:37.310
Ok, over here.

777
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:46.110
You just wait here for the rescue team.
I will take care of the bad guy.


778
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:50.710
Come on, Mad Max!
Move it! Let's go!


779
00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:53.210
Take care, kids.

780
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:56.910
Get up!

781
00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:03.310
I can prove I didn't do it!

782
00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:05.110
Just let me get to Devils Peak!

783
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:08.010
- There's another package of money!
- Save it for some one who cares!


784
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:13.710
A helicopter!
We're saved!


785
00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:24.410
- Where's he going?
- Something's not right...


786
00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:47.810
Uh! What is it with you
and the pushing?


787
00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:50.510
I want to speak to your superior!

788
00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:53.310
Is that him?

789
00:57:58.310 --> 00:57:59.510
Mr. Bragdon?

790
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.610
Mr. Bragdon, you're alive!

791
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:05.210
Hey, he's alive!

792
00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:06.610
Hello Maxwell.

793
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:11.310
Look, it's over. This guy's an FBI agent.
You got to give yourself up.


794
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.510
So what!
So the plan blew up in your face?


795
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:17.410
The important thing is, you have your health.

796
00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:21.110
And... your teeth...

797
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:26.010
Wait a minute! I thought they
found your teeth in the fire!


798
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:33.610
Yes, it was a bit inconvenient having them all pulled,
but at $1 million dollars a tooth, I think it was well worth it!


799
00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.110
What?

800
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:36.410
Kill him.

801
00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.810
Kill him? I can't kill him!

802
00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:41.410
He's just doing his job!

803
00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.610
No, no, Maxwell. 
Not him, ... you.

804
00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:47.310
Me?

805
00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:53.310
Wa ..wait a minute.

806
00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:55.210
You guys are in this together.

807
00:58:56.610 --> 00:59:00.610
He's in on this?
And you're with him?


808
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:06.110
And when you are done with him,
make sure you kill the kids.


809
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:07.210
The kids? Hey!

810
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:09.110
Come on. Move it.

811
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:14.710
Max was telling the truth!
We got to rescue him!


812
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:16.910
Yea, but, how are we going
to beat those guys?


813
00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:18.610
I got an idea.

814
00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:21.810
Everybody, close your eyes.

815
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:26.310
Oh boy!

816
00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:28.410
Why?

817
00:59:29.410 --> 00:59:30.610
Why did you pick me?

818
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:35.010
Because, you're a pathetic loser Max.
Nobody gives a damn about you.


819
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:39.110
You're wrong!
We give a damn! Fire!


820
00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:46.810
Kelsey, your training bra
is working great!


821
00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:48.010
That's the way to go, kids!

822
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:49.810
This is almost like
getting to second base.


823
00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:51.110
FIRE!

824
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:52.910
Keep them coming!

825
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:09.910
Oh no...

826
01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:11.210
You little brats!

827
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:14.010
Oh, my God!

828
01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.110
Not me! I'll take them both on!

829
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:19.410
Kiddies! Don't run away!
I just want to talk to you!


830
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.110
Come back here!

831
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:32.610
- Where's Dana?
- I don't know! He's gone!


832
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.310
Come on!

833
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.710
- What are we going to do?
- We got to jump!


834
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.110
Come on, they're trapped!

835
01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.910
Come back here, kiddies!
Come back here you little brats!


836
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:52.010
This better get us swimming badges!

837
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.410
Come on, Fishman.
You got to jump!


838
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:10.110
Superstud! Superstud!
I'm Superstud!


839
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:16.210
What is with these kids?
Quick, the chopper!


840
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:27.610
- I can't swim!
- I got you!


841
01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:39.410
- Those kids are nuts!
- Forget about the kids! Let's find Grabelski!


842
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:43.610
Damn!

843
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:05.110
- Max!
- Gordy!


844
01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:06.110
Come here!

845
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:10.610
Max!

846
01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:14.210
I got you!
I got you!


847
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:19.710
Grab on to me, Fishman!

848
01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:23.110
You know, Kelsey?
I think you're a hell of a scout!


849
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:32.410
- Where's Dana?
- I don't know!


850
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.310
Oh, my God, we've lost Dana!
Where is he?


851
01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:44.610
I see him, I see him!
We passed him!


852
01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:47.410
All right, all right, all right.
I'm turning around.


853
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:56.210
Kids, I got you.

854
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:04.810
Waterfall !!!

855
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:09.210
Waterfall! Hold on! Get to the side!
Swim to the side


856
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:11.110
Max. Grab onto something!

857
01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:26.110
Dana?

858
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:27.410
Hi, Max!

859
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.610
Where have you been?
We've been worried sick about you!


860
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.810
Shut up and hold on!

861
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.110
Pull! Pull!

862
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:43.510
Don't let go!

863
01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:47.110
Hang on! Pull!

864
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:52.610
Hold on, Dana, come on kids!

865
01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:58.110
Get out!

866
01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:13.110
- Yeah!
- Come on, get out.


867
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:16.910
Way to go, shorty!

868
01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.410
I might be short,
but I'm real strong!


869
01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:30.710
What is that?

870
01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:44.110
- Throw your packs in the river!
- What are you doing?
- They'll think we're dead!


871
01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:47.110
Throw them in! Throw them!

872
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:48.910
Do it! Throw them in!

873
01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:51.110
You can't!
My climbing stuff is in there!


874
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:53.110
Give it! Ugh!!

875
01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:57.010
Go! Go!!

876
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.310
Get in the bushes! Hide!

877
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:03.510
Let's go! Let's hide! Come on!

878
01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:15.110
It shouldn't be this hard to kill
six little scouts and one moron?


879
01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:19.310
Relax, what we couldn't do
Mother Nature did for us.


880
01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:48.110
Hey, it worked! Yeah!

881
01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:51.410
Now what?

882
01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:56.810
I'm sick.
I'm definitely getting sick.


883
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:59.310
Guys! Come on!
I found a cave!


884
01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:01.810
Yeah! You guys, let's go!

885
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:04.310
Yeah!

886
01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:05.410
I'm coming!

887
01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:13.910
Mrs. Patterson, hi, you know I have to apologize to you.
I've been dumping my anxiety on you.


888
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:19.710
And I feel terrible. I have a terrible temper I know, but
Dana is my first. And I get very emotional, you know, and ..


889
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:25.810
I remember when he came out at the hospital
he was so small, he was like a little duckling.


890
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:27.610
- Mr. Jarecki...
- Huh?


891
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:31.110
I think you need to call your wife.
She's probably very worried.


892
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:32.310
Oh, yeah. Whew.

893
01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:39.110
My wife, call my wife.
You got 20 cents I could borrow, please?


894
01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.310
- I don't have...
- Take what you need.


895
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.110
Thank you. Thank you.
You're good.


896
01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:58.110
Devil's Peak?

897
01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:03.310
You know, if we go after Bragdon before daybreak,
we'd be able to catch him by surprise.


898
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:04.310
Yeah, that would work!

899
01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:05.810
Go right down and rip his head off!

900
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.710
- Yea, we could beat him up...
- We could dissect him!


901
01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:09.710
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.


902
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.310
That's too dangerous!

903
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:15.110
But we have to make sure
the whole world knows you're innocent.


904
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.610
I mean, you're our scout leader!

905
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:21.510
You are still going to be
our scout leader, right?


906
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:26.510
Yeah,

907
01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.610
of course I am.

908
01:07:30.110 --> 01:07:33.710
If you get the electric chair, you should put
a light bulb in your mouth, like Uncle Fester.


909
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:36.110
That's a good idea.

910
01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:00.610
Hey Max!

911
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:03.510
You're up early.

912
01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:06.910
Is something wrong?

913
01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:12.810
No, nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Should be up on Devils Peak in about three hours.


914
01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:17.110
Intercept the package, turn it in, and
be done with this whole thing.


915
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:19.110
Yeah, I'll go wake the guys.

916
01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:22.810
Sure you want to do this?

917
01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:26.110
What are you kidding?
We didn't come this far to quit now!


918
01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:27.410
Go scout ahead.

919
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:01.110
Two hours.

920
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:08.610
Oh boy!
We're never going to make it.


921
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:11.810
Devil's Peak, Devil's Peak.

922
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:16.210
Ok, Devil's Peak. I knew it.
Reinhardt Bragdon! Here we go.


923
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:22.110
Mr. McMurrey,
I found something!


924
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:24.410
Well, if it isn't Scout Mother Patterson!

925
01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:26.410
Sorry, but this is a private briefing.

926
01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:28.410
Max Grabelski is heading to Devil's Peak.

927
01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:31.010
Devil's Peak. Why would
he want to go to Devil's Peak?


928
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:33.910
There's a cabin up there
and it belongs to Reinhardt Bragdon!


929
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:36.110
How do you know that?

930
01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:39.910
I'm a real estate broker. That house has
been on the listings for six months.


931
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:46.110
A real estate broker! Ok. Ok.
Well, thank you very much for the tip. I'm sorry ...but


932
01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:48.610
Look, I just told you
where those kids are.


933
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:51.910
Now, you get your skinny butt
up there and you rescue them!


934
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:54.110
Or do I have to do it alone?

935
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:02.110
Oh, God.

936
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.010
Come on guys, just
like what we practiced!


937
01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:11.610
I'm telling you, just let me break
out my Kilimanjaro gear!


938
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:14.810
- Barnhill, you're so full of it!
- You're such a B.S.er!


939
01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.110
- Did you just rip one?
- I did not!


940
01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:18.910
Yes, you did. You stink!

941
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:20.310
Will you guys knock it off?

942
01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:22.310
I can't climb behind this guy anymore!

943
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:24.310
- Why are you blaming me?
- Don't make me climb down there!


944
01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:51.210
Damn it!

945
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:57.810
May I be of some assistance?

946
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:20.210
Oh, no...

947
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:23.310
How are we going to get over there?

948
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:27.510
There's no more ledge, we can't get across.

949
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:29.610
You're going to need to use these.

950
01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:30.810
Here we go!

951
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:33.210
Hold this.

952
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:35.010
That's your climbing rope,

953
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:37.410
this is your hammer,

954
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:38.910
and these,

955
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.410
are the pitons.

956
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:44.310
Hammer a piton into
the crack in the rock.


957
01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:48.810
Barnhill, would you knock it off!
You have no idea what you're talking about!


958
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:53.110
Then all you got to do is just pass the rope through
and then belay yourself off.


959
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.310
"Belay myself off "?

960
01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:00.810
Belay myself off ?!

961
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:07.210
Hey Maxie, hit that thing till it rings!

962
01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:09.610
He's going to get killed...

963
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:15.110
Barnhill, I know this is
a bad time to be asking, ..


964
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:19.810
but you really did
climb Kilimanjaro, right?


965
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:22.110
I'm telling you. I did!

966
01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:24.710
That's good, that's good.

967
01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:29.210
Ok, because, if you didn't, tell me now

968
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:34.110
and I promise,
I won't get mad or anything.


969
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:36.110
I swear!

970
01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.510
See? Nothing to it!

971
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:29.510
Piece of cake!

972
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:33.510
- What is the matter with you?

973
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:36.310
- I demand that you do something!
- You demand?


974
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:40.510
When there is something to do,
we will do something!


975
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:46.210
But, Mrs. Patterson told you, they're in
some cabin somewhere out there?


976
01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:47.510
Right, Aggie? Aggie...?

977
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:50.710
Keep going guys.
You're going to make it!


978
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:54.410
Whatever you do, just don't look down!

979
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:56.210
Too late!

980
01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:06.710
We're going to make it!

981
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:08.010
Max, give me your hand!

982
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:20.510
I don't believe it!

983
01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:23.910
Well, Max, we tried, anyway!

984
01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:26.110
Not everything!

985
01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:47.210
According to your body mass, you should
be able to hold out for another ... 3 1/2 minutes.


986
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:50.910
Oh, good.
Then take your time!


987
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:59.110
Ay! My fingers!

988
01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:04.610
Guys...

989
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:08.210
Guys?

990
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:12.810
Oh, very funny!

991
01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:16.910
Where's the truck, already?

992
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:20.910
Relax, the truck will be here at 10:00.
It's guaranteed!


993
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:24.210
Look, killing Grabelski is one thing,
I wasn't counting on killing those kids!


994
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:28.910
We got a big bundle here.
Why don't we just take this and move out?


995
01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:32.510
That truck is delivering
the last $10 million dollars.


996
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:34.710
We're not going anywhere.

997
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:40.810
I can't believe we just did it, guys.

998
01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:42.010
We made it!

999
01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:44.010
We made it! Yes!

1000
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:52.010
Devil's Peak.
We made it.


1001
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:56.610
Hey, there's the truck.
Hide! Hide!


1002
01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:06.810
Right on time!

1003
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:08.210
10AM, guaranteed!

1004
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:10.410
Sign this.

1005
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:23.510
What do you see, Fishman.

1006
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:26.410
I see the FBI guy,

1007
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:29.410
I see the other guy
loading money into suitcases


1008
01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.110
and I see Gordy's
mom, tied to a chair.

1009
01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:33.410
What?

1010
01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:35.110
Max, what are we going to do?

1011
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:38.610
I'm thinking...
Sir?


1012
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:41.110
I'm thinking!

1013
01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:44.510
This will work.

1014
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:46.810
- We're going with you!
- Yeah! We're going too!


1015
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:48.410
No! I said no!

1016
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:50.110
It's my mom!

1017
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:53.310
Listen! I got us into this mess...
and I'm going to get us ...


1018
01:16:56.610 --> 01:16:58.110
I'm going to get
us out of this mess!

1019
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:59.110
Oh, boy!

1020
01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:00.610
Listen!

1021
01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:02.410
What?

1022
01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:04.510
Is something wrong?

1023
01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:08.510
No...

1024
01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:11.010
Well, then, start loading
the money in the chopper.


1025
01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:22.510
Guys, please! Just sit tight and
stay here where it's safe!


1026
01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:25.010
Aah! Oh, my God!

1027
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:27.610
This is too touching for words.

1028
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:32.910
Don't worry, Grabelski.
You're going to be the first one to get it.


1029
01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:35.010
No! Don't!
Listen.


1030
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:37.310
I just want
to tell you one thing!


1031
01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:38.810
What?

1032
01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:40.410
Uh...

1033
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:44.110
...you are a disgrace to the FBI!

1034
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.110
Oh, that hurts!

1035
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:48.910
Now, I just want
to tell you one thing:

1036
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:50.210
What?

1037
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:51.710
You're a dead man!

1038
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:53.410
Hey, cupcake!

1039
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:55.510
Oh, no!

1040
01:18:00.210 --> 01:18:01.310
Sergeant Doofus!

1041
01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:07.410
You and I got to
have a little talk, mister.

1042
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:09.810
I can't talk now.
I got to go help Gordy's mom!


1043
01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:11.610
Stay here and watch him!

1044
01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:14.310
Hold him down!

1045
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:17.510
What do we do with him, sir?

1046
01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:19.710
I got an idea.

1047
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:28.510
Palmer?

1048
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:32.110
Palmer!

1049
01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:36.910
Oh, marvelous!

1050
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:56.210
Mrs. Patterson!
Hey listen,


1051
01:18:57.110 --> 01:19:01.110
I'm not really a scout leader.
My name is Max, and I'm here to save you.


1052
01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:03.110
Now, be very quiet.

1053
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:07.610
- You lying, irresponsible..!!
- Ok, we'll get to know each other later.


1054
01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:12.510
All right, now, what kind of knots
did these kids say these were?


1055
01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:14.710
[ muffled ]
(Oh, my God, he's an idiot!)


1056
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:17.110
A little lesson in common decency.

1057
01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:20.110
- Oh! Oh!
- Ok, what do we do now?


1058
01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:22.110
What did you do
with the handcuffs?


1059
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:29.210
So, it's not a figure eight, it's not
a butterfly and it's not a fisherman's.


1060
01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:32.210
- It's a clove hitch.
- Ah, thank you.


1061
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.810
Ahh!

1062
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:36.310
I learned it in the scouts.

1063
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:44.010
Let me show you the
wonderful view off the porch.


1064
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:46.310
Please, you don't want
to do this, Mr. Bragdon.


1065
01:19:46.410 --> 01:19:48.410
Oh, but of course I do, Maxwell!

1066
01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:52.610
I'm sorry.

1067
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:56.510
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Maxwell.


1068
01:19:57.310 --> 01:20:01.110
Noooo !!!

1069
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:25.110
- No! Gordy!
- Noo !!!


1070
01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:32.310
That was one of my kids,
you crazy sicko!


1071
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:37.110
- Mom!
- Gordy?


1072
01:20:37.210 --> 01:20:38.210
Help!

1073
01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:42.210
Gordy! Where are you?

1074
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:43.910
Down here!

1075
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:47.810
- Help!
- Hold on, honey!


1076
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:55.810
- Gordy?
- Max!


1077
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:03.710
Oh boy!

1078
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:05.810
- Max!
- Hey kid!


1079
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:08.410
How's it "hanging"!

1080
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:11.310
Wait up. Hurry!

1081
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.910
Where's Gordy?

1082
01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:14.710
Don't worry, Gordy.
I'm coming down!


1083
01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:18.110
No! You don't know
what you're doing!


1084
01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:20.410
Of course I do!

1085
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:22.810
I'm the Lizard, remember?

1086
01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:24.710
You mean the Spider?

1087
01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:27.310
Right.

1088
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:31.810
- Gordy!
- Where is he?


1089
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:33.710
Down there. Max?

1090
01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:41.810
I'm just a delivery guy!

1091
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:46.110
Ok, reach!

1092
01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:49.010
Come on, reach!

1093
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:51.310
- I can't!
- Reach and I'll grab you!


1094
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:52.210
Cracking...

1095
01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:01.210
- I'm scared!
- Believe me, I'm scared too.


1096
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:03.710
Now, you're going
to have to let go!


1097
01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:07.210
Come on, now.
Come on. Let go.


1098
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:18.710
I got you!

1099
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.210
I got you, kid!
I got you!


1100
01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:33.710
You've got to stop
goofing around like this.


1101
01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:45.610
Don't let go!

1102
01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:13.210
- Here they come!
- Gordy!


1103
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:20.810
There, I got you!

1104
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:28.610
We made it!

1105
01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:30.210
Thank you, thank you Max.

1106
01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:32.310
Hey, it was nothing!

1107
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:35.510
Just a little mountain!

1108
01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:47.610
For achievement in mountain climbing, survival, rescue skills
and citizenship above and beyond the call of duty,


1109
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:53.810
you kids went right pass Tenderfoot badges
and on to something much greater.


1110
01:23:54.310 --> 01:24:01.310
Therefore, I am very proud to present to each
one of you, the Ranger's highest badge ..


1111
01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.510
First Class Eagle!
You earned it!


1112
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:15.310
Good job, guys!

1113
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:18.310
Now...

1114
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:22.910
As for you, Mr. Grabelski.

1115
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:32.110
When you took these kids on an overnight,
you broke every rule in the book!


1116
01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:36.810
But, when they got into trouble,

1117
01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:46.810
you demonstrated the kind of courage, values and honor, which
are the cornerstones of the Ranger Scouts.


1118
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:53.310
It gives me great
pleasure to present Max Grabelski...

1119
01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:59.910
...with the badge of Ranger Scout Leader!

1120
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:08.410
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

1121
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:10.210
Thank you!

1122
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:15.110
Hey! Guys! Look at this,
I'm a real live scout leader!


1123
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:20.710
Thank you, thank you!

1124
01:25:22.110 --> 01:25:24.110
Now, for your next assignment...

1125
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:25.410
Next assignment?

1126
01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:29.610
You and the kids are going to hit Yosemite
and you're going to hit it hard!


1127
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:32.610
Hear that, guys? I get to
take you on another overnight!


1128
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:36.610
No, Mr. Grabelski, not just your kids...

1129
01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:39.210
Huh?

1130
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:41.910
All the kids!

1131
01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:57.610
No! Just!

1132
01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:02.110
AHH !!!
