Synced and corrected by R3V0LV3R.

2
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.754
Michael, uh, you remember me
from the last time you and I talked?


3
00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:32.689
About a week ago?

4
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.819
You see this camera?
You're going to have to say "yes"...


5
00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:38.057
so that camera can take down
everything you say.


6
00:00:38.132 --> 00:00:42.159
Because that camera can't take down
something when you shake your head.


7
00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:46.036
Can you say "yes" for us?
Let me hear you say, "yes." "Yes."


8
00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:49.303
That's pretty good. How about a
little bit louder than that? "Yes."


9
00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:53.506
And we talked about what happened
on the 13th of May?


10
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.912
- You remember that?
- Yeah.


11
00:00:55.983 --> 00:01:01.819
Now, Michael, do you know what it is to,
uh-to tell the truth about things?


12
00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:05.023
You're gonna have to say "yes."
You can't shake your head. "Yes."


13
00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:10.121
Okay. What does it mean when you
have to tell the truth about things?


14
00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.699
- Don't lie.
- Don't lie. That's right.


15
00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:17.066
And do you know what happens
to people who lie?


16
00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:19.631
- Hmm?
- Yeah.


17
00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:21.765
- What happens to them?
- They get hurt.


18
00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:23.867
They get hurt.

19
00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:44.192
Yes, the big story on Action News tonight
is the effort to evict MOVE...


20
00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:47.199
from its house
on the 6200 block of Osage Avenue.


21
00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:49.360
The effort has turned into a disaster.

22
00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:53.805
The fire is now five-alarm,
still raging out of control as you can see.


23
00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:57.207
An unknown number of heavily-armed
MOVE members continue at large,


24
00:01:57.277 --> 00:01:59.211
possibly roaming the alleyways.

25
00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:03.511
Going in, everybody knew
that MOVE would resist anything.


26
00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:07.281
While the police will say that
they come here to arrest people,


27
00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:08.878
we have done nothing wrong.

28
00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:11.550
We do not want policemen killed.
We do not want people in the house killed.


29
00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.321
Fellow officer, James Ramp,
was killed seven years ago.


30
00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:15.884
They will never forget that.

31
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.727
Okay. This is unconfirmed.
We've got to emphasize this is unconfirmed.


32
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.530
But Channel 10 technician,
Fran Hardy reports-


33
00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:25.731
An incendiary device
was dropped out of that helicopter.


34
00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:28.001
Nobody around here has ever
seen anything like this.


35
00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.339
We expect that maybe 60, perhaps more,
homes have gone up in flames.


36
00:02:33.413 --> 00:02:37.315
I stand fully accountable
for the actions that took place tonight.


37
00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:43.151
How did an attempt to arrest MOVE members
become an inferno that killed 11 people...


38
00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:45.020
and destroyed 61 homes?

39
00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:50.029
You can call the group reactionists,
revolutionaries, terrorists.


40
00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:55.535
That was a decision...
to let the fire burn.


41
00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.197
On May 13, 1985,

42
00:03:33.273 --> 00:03:36.709
years of conflict between
the city of Philadelphia...


43
00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:40.008
and a small, urban group
known as MOVE...


44
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.948
ended in a violent,
daylong encounter...


45
00:03:44.017 --> 00:03:47.077
between the groups' members
and the Philadelphia police.


46
00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:54.255
It was one of the most devastating days
in the modern history of the city.


47
00:03:55.462 --> 00:03:58.454
Before we call the first witness...

48
00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:01.194
I want to tell you
about this special commission.


49
00:04:02.436 --> 00:04:06.668
We are men and women,
black and white,


50
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.368
guided by our own attitudes
and beliefs.


51
00:04:11.078 --> 00:04:15.105
What we hope to accomplish
is to begin healing the wounds...


52
00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:20.745
caused by the failure to resolve
conflicting lifestyles in a peaceful way.


53
00:04:38.638 --> 00:04:41.698
Six, five, four, three...

54
00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:48.876
This is MOVE, the people in an organization
that admits to being totally revolutionary.


55
00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.087
For the past four years,
they have lived in the


56
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.249
Powelton Village area
of West Philadelphia,


57
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.414
often running into conflicts with police.

58
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.913
Their personal appearance
has brought stares and


59
00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:01.359
some expressions of disapproval
from the community.


60
00:05:01.428 --> 00:05:04.226
But it what they do that counts,
not how they look.


61
00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:08.324
In everything from work habits to
child raising, MOVE is revolutionary.


62
00:05:08.402 --> 00:05:11.132
Uh, I was indoctrinated with a philosophy
in the Panthers...


63
00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:15.163
that revolution only meant picking up a
gun and going out and murdering somebody.


64
00:05:15.242 --> 00:05:19.508
I never thought that revolution
consisted of revolutionizing myself...


65
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:22.571
to get away from the things
that caused me to wanna revolt.


66
00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:27.981
MOVE does not believe in technology.
They use a wood-burning stove for heat,


67
00:05:28.054 --> 00:05:29.919
and they have no electricity.

68
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.925
But they do have cars,
and they have a telephone. Why?


69
00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:37.259
All the answers are in the guidelines,
their bible left by John Africa.


70
00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:45.367
Miss Sims, can you describe for me
what the philosophy of MOVE was?


71
00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.294
What did John Africa
teach with regard to the


72
00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:51.173
society in which you
found yourself living?


73
00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:53.337
You're asking what was being taught?

74
00:05:53.413 --> 00:05:54.402
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:58.440
Okay. Um, the absolute truth.

76
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.483
We were being taught
about this system.


77
00:06:04.424 --> 00:06:06.688
The corruption in this system.

78
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:13.822
But mainly, it was...
just the absolute truth.


79
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.567
What John Africa did was...
expose the lie in the system.


80
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.130
Uncover it.

81
00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:25.076
Could you describe what you mean
by the word "the system", please?


82
00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:27.079
The system.
The establishment. You.


83
00:06:30.984 --> 00:06:33.680
Philadelphia is a tortured city.

84
00:06:33.753 --> 00:06:36.313
Trash piles up at the curbline.

85
00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:38.983
Kids are afraid to walk to school.

86
00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.823
Abandoned homes
pockmark the ghetto.


87
00:06:41.895 --> 00:06:46.491
Philadelphia needs a strong man
for a tough job.


88
00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:49.330
Philadelphia needs
Frank Rizzo as mayor.


89
00:06:51.037 --> 00:06:54.700
A small, vocal minority among us...

90
00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:58.938
seeks to destroy
the heritage of 1776.


91
00:06:59.012 --> 00:07:04.973
We must be ever-vigilant that this minority
does not impose its philosophy...


92
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:08.384
on the unwilling majority of Americans.

93
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.192
In their vigilant effort to maintain
close contact with mother Earth,


94
00:07:14.261 --> 00:07:18.459
the MOVE members are breaking up the cement
of the sidewalk around their property.


95
00:07:24.104 --> 00:07:26.538
Yeah, life.

96
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:30.840
But you are not animals. I mean...

97
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:32.606
- Why not?
- I don't want to be personal.


98
00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:34.943
- Wait a minute. Why not?
- Yes, we are.


99
00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:39.679
We are animals, because our reference is no
different than the reference of animals.


100
00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:41.473
There's only one reference,
and that's life.


101
00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:45.390
That's what MOVE is about.
Life. Truth. That's our religion.


102
00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:53.459
We see John Africa in the same way
that people saw Jesus Christ...


103
00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:58.630
because of his carpentry, because of his
simple way of living, and so forth.


104
00:07:58.705 --> 00:08:04.439
Now, we know that John Africa is a man
who can explain Jesus Christ.


105
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.974
When Reverend Audrey Bronson wants to
practice her religion, nobody beats her up.


106
00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:18.121
But when MOVE wanted to practice their
religion, people started talking about, uh,


107
00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:20.853
"it's not done that way."

108
00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:26.888
There are Catholics and Methodists,
evangelists, theologians, you name it.


109
00:08:26.967 --> 00:08:29.527
We were the religion of life.

110
00:08:29.603 --> 00:08:34.165
Where is it written that we could not
have a religion of our own?


111
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.209
Your brother, Vincent Leapheart
was John Africa, is that correct?


112
00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:41.907
My brother, Vincent Leapheart,
was my brother.


113
00:08:41.982 --> 00:08:45.679
John Africa was the founder
of the MOVE organization.


114
00:08:45.752 --> 00:08:48.448
And they were one and the same?

115
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:51.684
I said my brother was my brother.

116
00:08:51.758 --> 00:08:56.092
And I said John Africa was
the founder of the MOVE organization.


117
00:08:56.162 --> 00:09:00.030
John-Vincent Leapheart
is my brother.


118
00:09:07.607 --> 00:09:11.839
When Michael was about two years of age,
he was taken by his mother...


119
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:16.871
to a residence occupied by members
of an organization called MOVE.


120
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.386
And Michael was subsequently
given the name of Birdie Africa.


121
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:25.186
Michael Ward was, of course,
no more a member of MOVE...


122
00:09:25.258 --> 00:09:28.853
than a child of Republican
or Democratic parents...


123
00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:31.396
would be styled by
a particular party label.


124
00:09:31.464 --> 00:09:35.025
He was throughout,
an absolutely innocent,


125
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:39.470
guiltless, and under the circumstances,
vulnerable child and youngster.


126
00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:31.080
Now, when you go to school
and you embrace that education,


127
00:10:31.157 --> 00:10:35.059
the very first thing you are
taught in school is separation...


128
00:10:35.128 --> 00:10:38.723
is categorization,
alienation, conflict.


129
00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:41.699
You're taught black, white,
blue, green.


130
00:10:41.768 --> 00:10:45.898
Up, down, back, forth.
Taught, uh, Protestant, Catholic.


131
00:10:45.972 --> 00:10:49.464
Taught Yale, Harvard.
Conflict. War.


132
00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:54.809
You know, if a child does not know
that he is black and I am white,


133
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:56.644
if he is not taught
that categorization,


134
00:10:56.716 --> 00:10:58.308
if he is not taught
that separation,


135
00:10:58.384 --> 00:11:01.581
In the place of that,
all he can gravitate to,


136
00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:04.748
all he can know is harmony,
is unity, is love.


137
00:11:22.776 --> 00:11:24.767
Life! Life!

138
00:11:25.955 --> 00:11:27.955
- Did you like raw food?
- Some of it.


139
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:31.246
Some of it?
What did you like particularly?


140
00:11:32.218 --> 00:11:35.654
Watermelon, mangoes...

141
00:11:35.722 --> 00:11:38.020
and sweet potatoes and onions.

142
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:40.889
And onions.
Did you all eat any meat at all?


143
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.155
Only one time
we ate raw chicken.


144
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.366
Why would the adults eat
cooked food and the


145
00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:48.426
children not eat cooked food?
Do you know?


146
00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:50.765
They said they wasn't
used to raw food.


147
00:11:50.837 --> 00:11:54.295
They weren't used to raw food
and the children were used to raw food.


148
00:12:10.723 --> 00:12:14.124
Were you all ever punished
for taking the food or anything?


149
00:12:15.895 --> 00:12:18.455
Yeah. Did they punish you
when you...


150
00:12:18.531 --> 00:12:21.091
- They had meetings on us.
- They had meetings?


151
00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:23.397
Would they ever hit the children?

152
00:12:25.004 --> 00:12:28.030
Uh, so you didn't get any spankings
or anything like that?


153
00:12:28.107 --> 00:12:31.372
- They didn't believe in spanking.
- They didn't believe in spankings.


154
00:12:31.444 --> 00:12:36.905
I see. Did you, uh-When they holler at
the children, what would the children do?


155
00:12:36.983 --> 00:12:38.746
- Cry.
- They would cry?


156
00:12:38.818 --> 00:12:41.048
- Did they ever holler at you?
- Yes.


157
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.611
- Did you cry when you were hollered at?
- Yeah.


158
00:12:46.926 --> 00:12:50.225
- Did they-Did they say they loved you?
- Yeah.


159
00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:52.196
Did you love them?

160
00:13:09.916 --> 00:13:13.317
I came in contact with MOVE
back in 1974.


161
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.179
We had a number of rap sessions
with youngsters...


162
00:13:16.256 --> 00:13:19.384
in terms of trying to offer
a different point of view.


163
00:13:19.459 --> 00:13:22.553
Did they appear to you
to be violent at all?


164
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:28.295
No, it basically appeared to be a
progressive, uh, political organization...


165
00:13:28.368 --> 00:13:30.962
pretty much concerned
about the issues...


166
00:13:31.037 --> 00:13:33.335
that impacted
on the black community.


167
00:13:34.507 --> 00:13:38.807
Officer Cresse, was there any indication
that you were aware of...


168
00:13:38.878 --> 00:13:42.439
that, uh, the MOVE members
were potentially violent?


169
00:13:44.217 --> 00:13:47.618
Other than being, uh, vocal,
no, sir.


170
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.084
They can put out weird things
like you can hear me use profanity.


171
00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:59.257
But is it possible to describe a maniac,
a profane, obscene, pornographic freak...


172
00:13:59.332 --> 00:14:01.095
without using profane words?

173
00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:04.034
Motherfuckers!

174
00:14:07.674 --> 00:14:13.510
Do you have information concerning how
many arrests occurred involving MOVE?


175
00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:16.275
There was 141 demonstrations.

176
00:14:17.984 --> 00:14:20.214
There was 97 court cases.

177
00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:26.850
There was eight meetings,
and there was 193 arrests.


178
00:14:28.594 --> 00:14:30.653
I have as just as much right...

179
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.494
and my brother got just
as much right to speak as you.


180
00:14:33.566 --> 00:14:36.535
So what you doin' arrogantly
gaveling us down?


181
00:14:36.602 --> 00:14:39.298
- This is not a forum for your political views.
- What is it?


182
00:14:39.372 --> 00:14:42.830
- Do you understand that?
- Do you understand that I was brought here...


183
00:14:42.909 --> 00:14:45.742
because of my beliefs,
because of my views?


184
00:14:45.812 --> 00:14:48.747
I object. I think the witness,
at this point,


185
00:14:48.815 --> 00:14:51.045
is badgering the judge.

186
00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:55.148
They were, in fact,
telling the truth in the courtroom,


187
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:57.519
and because the judge
could not dispute it,


188
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.152
because the judge had went
to Harvard and Yale and Cornell...


189
00:15:02.228 --> 00:15:05.391
to learn what law was.

190
00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:08.593
They could not understand
how a people could stand there,


191
00:15:08.668 --> 00:15:13.037
looking as they did, but yet knowing
more, in fact, than they did.


192
00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:18.908
And this called for many contempts,
many beatings in the courtroom.


193
00:15:18.978 --> 00:15:22.277
And it was like a repeat
over and over again.


194
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:30.678
Officer Cresse, directing your attention
to approximately March 30 of 1976,


195
00:15:30.757 --> 00:15:34.557
what, if anything occurred during
that time period with regard to MOVE.


196
00:15:35.595 --> 00:15:39.531
Twenty-four-hour surveillance was
established at the MOVE compound...


197
00:15:39.599 --> 00:15:41.863
at 309 North 33rd Street.

198
00:15:41.934 --> 00:15:46.428
Around the same time,
was there any, um,


199
00:15:46.506 --> 00:15:49.475
situation that arose
with regard to an infant?


200
00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:51.476
Yes, sir.
Could you describe that, sir?


201
00:15:51.544 --> 00:15:52.533
Okay.

202
00:15:59.352 --> 00:16:01.286
Just bear with me, please.

203
00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:18.235
On March 28 of this year,
at about 4:00 in the morning,


204
00:16:18.304 --> 00:16:22.673
some MOVE members were returning from
one of many sentences in the city jail.


205
00:16:22.742 --> 00:16:25.074
The MOVE people say
they weren't making a lot of noise.


206
00:16:25.144 --> 00:16:27.635
But someone in the neighborhood
complained to the police.


207
00:16:28.514 --> 00:16:30.618
What happened next is
the beginning of a


208
00:16:30.631 --> 00:16:32.746
controversy that has yet
to be investigated.


209
00:16:33.486 --> 00:16:35.852
Somehow an argument
led to a scuffle.


210
00:16:35.922 --> 00:16:38.482
Police reinforcements
were quickly on the scene,


211
00:16:38.558 --> 00:16:40.856
and MOVE put up resistance.

212
00:16:40.927 --> 00:16:43.919
By the time it was over,
six policemen reported injuries,


213
00:16:43.996 --> 00:16:45.896
six members of MOVE were arrested,

214
00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:48.763
and later, it was found that
three-week-old Life Africa,


215
00:16:48.835 --> 00:16:51.065
one of the MOVE babies, was dead.

216
00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:02.942
We went upstairs
to inquire reporters there.


217
00:17:03.616 --> 00:17:06.813
And we saw-
We were led into a dark room,


218
00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:11.152
and we saw what appeared to be
the remains of a baby.


219
00:17:12.158 --> 00:17:15.059
And it was their contention
that this baby had been killed...


220
00:17:15.128 --> 00:17:16.652
in a police raid.

221
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:22.392
Subsequent to that, I introduced
the resolution to the city council,


222
00:17:22.468 --> 00:17:24.402
calling for an investigation.

223
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:30.067
It never took place and I felt at that time
that the MOVE people were being harassed...


224
00:17:30.143 --> 00:17:32.134
and that it was a racial problem.

225
00:17:33.479 --> 00:17:37.176
Shortly thereafter,
I received some letters...


226
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.444
from the people who live
on 32nd and Pearl Street.


227
00:17:41.654 --> 00:17:43.775
And they indicated that
they were displeased


228
00:17:43.788 --> 00:17:45.920
with MOVE, and they
wanted to meet me.


229
00:17:47.026 --> 00:17:49.494
And I went to the meeting
expecting to see...


230
00:17:53.132 --> 00:17:57.091
mostly Caucasian people
complaining about MOVE.


231
00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.731
And I was surprised
when I entered the home...


232
00:18:00.806 --> 00:18:05.937
that most of the people there were-were
black people, just ordinary black people.


233
00:18:06.812 --> 00:18:11.545
And for the first time I realized
that it was not a racial problem with MOVE.


234
00:18:11.617 --> 00:18:16.452
But that it was something else
that I just did not understand.


235
00:18:16.522 --> 00:18:21.824
And then I learned that unless you did
everything that they wanted you to do,


236
00:18:23.095 --> 00:18:25.393
uh, you were an enemy.

237
00:18:35.374 --> 00:18:39.140
On May 20, 1977,
MOVE brandished weapons...


238
00:18:39.212 --> 00:18:41.544
from their Powelton Village
headquarters platform...


239
00:18:41.614 --> 00:18:44.879
saying, "No longer will we be beaten
or intimidated by the police...


240
00:18:44.951 --> 00:18:46.885
without a like response."

241
00:18:50.089 --> 00:18:51.898
To your knowledge, did any
of the members of the


242
00:18:51.911 --> 00:18:53.730
MOVE organization ever
possess any weapons?


243
00:18:55.127 --> 00:18:57.118
- Not to my knowledge.
- Nor mine.


244
00:18:57.196 --> 00:19:00.962
Have you ever seen the pictures
of May 20, 1977, at Powelton Village,


245
00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:02.968
where people are carrying what appear,
at least, to be weapons?


246
00:19:02.993 --> 00:19:04.035
Yes, I have.

247
00:19:04.036 --> 00:19:05.321
Were those members of
the MOVE organization?


248
00:19:05.334 --> 00:19:06.630
Yes, they were.

249
00:19:06.706 --> 00:19:08.401
Were they weapons?
I don't know.


250
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:12.742
I don't want anyone to think
that I'm insulting their intelligence,


251
00:19:12.812 --> 00:19:16.771
but when you have anything like that,

252
00:19:16.849 --> 00:19:19.875
regardless to what it looks like,

253
00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:23.023
if it is found inside of
the house or not found


254
00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:26.118
inside the house and
it is brought out...


255
00:19:26.192 --> 00:19:28.888
and it is found to be inoperable,

256
00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:30.895
it is found not to work at all,

257
00:19:30.963 --> 00:19:35.332
as far as I'm concerned,
it's not a weapon.


258
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:37.596
But let me be clear.

259
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.934
This can be a weapon.

260
00:19:40.006 --> 00:19:44.602
But I'm talking about to the point
of a weapon that can fire.


261
00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:49.810
It's just like you said.
What appeared to be weapons.


262
00:20:11.237 --> 00:20:14.798
In my view, it seemed
to suggest a turning point.


263
00:20:14.874 --> 00:20:17.809
It was the point
which it became clear...


264
00:20:17.877 --> 00:20:23.042
that MOVE, in fact,
could become a violent organization.


265
00:20:23.115 --> 00:20:26.482
Uh, would, in fact, fight,

266
00:20:26.552 --> 00:20:30.716
would, in fact, use weapons
in order to accomplish their mission.


267
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:37.158
They named the game.
And I assure you, they lose.


268
00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:38.719
We'll do what's necessary.

269
00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:40.823
- What is that?
- The strategy of John Africa.


270
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.595
- What is that?
- Our only defense.


271
00:20:42.668 --> 00:20:45.000
- What is that?
- The strategy of John Africa.


272
00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:47.665
You aren't tellin' me anything. You're just
saying "the strategy of John Africa."


273
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.767
Hey, I wouldn't tell my strategy to you.

274
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.011
We ain't talkin' about hurtin'
nobody's religion.


275
00:21:07.024 --> 00:21:09.156
We ain't talkin' about killin'
off nobody's religion.


276
00:21:09.228 --> 00:21:11.253
Rizzo is talkin' about
religious persecution.


277
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.133
Don't question the person
tellin' the truth.


278
00:21:13.146 --> 00:21:14.959
Question the person
that's tellin' the lie.


279
00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:16.365
All right!

280
00:21:25.211 --> 00:21:29.113
Only in a democracy could they get away
with what they're getting away with.


281
00:21:56.142 --> 00:21:58.667
People are people regardless
of their color, their skin,


282
00:21:58.744 --> 00:22:00.268
their religion, their race or nothin'.

283
00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:02.837
They're still people.
They can bleed. They can die.


284
00:22:02.915 --> 00:22:05.850
They can catch diseases.
We can all go through the same situations.


285
00:22:05.918 --> 00:22:10.412
It's unnecessary for all of that.
I really think it's unnecessary.


286
00:22:13.292 --> 00:22:15.413
And it's all going to
boil down to a bunch of


287
00:22:15.426 --> 00:22:17.558
people getting hurt and
killed over nothin'.


288
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:19.996
Over nothin' that doesn't really
make any sense.


289
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.802
At 6:10 a.m., Mayor Rizzo finally,
after 15 months of confrontation,


290
00:22:28.874 --> 00:22:31.434
used the force he threatened all along.

291
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.877
The police will be in there to drag
them out by the backs of their necks.


292
00:22:34.947 --> 00:22:39.350
They're going to be taken by force
if they resist.


293
00:22:39.418 --> 00:22:41.784
If police come in there with their hands,
we'll use our hands.


294
00:22:41.854 --> 00:22:44.516
If they come in here with clubs,
we'll use clubs.


295
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.616
But if they come in here shootin' and
killin' our women and children and our men,


296
00:22:47.693 --> 00:22:50.389
we will shoot back
in defense of our lives.


297
00:22:50.463 --> 00:22:54.957
I've learned one thing as a policeman.
You never underestimate your opponent.


298
00:22:55.034 --> 00:23:00.700
You always get in there faster with more
than is necessary, and you overpower them.


299
00:23:16.856 --> 00:23:20.019
Stakeout personnel, using body shields,

300
00:23:20.092 --> 00:23:26.156
cover fireman as they position a portable
deluge gun closer to the compound.


301
00:23:38.744 --> 00:23:40.678
Shots have been fired!

302
00:23:40.746 --> 00:23:44.182
Officers and firemen are
wounded by gunfire.


303
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.378
First deluge gun goes out of control.

304
00:23:53.526 --> 00:23:57.895
Other officers and firemen
move in to pull the wounded personnel...


305
00:23:57.963 --> 00:24:00.158
out of the line of fire.

306
00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:04.002
Officer Ramp, shown here
lying on his back,


307
00:24:04.069 --> 00:24:06.435
has now been mortally wounded.

308
00:24:06.505 --> 00:24:08.439
Officer Hesson, also wounded,

309
00:24:08.507 --> 00:24:11.704
crawls over and attempts
to shield officer Ramp.


310
00:24:41.407 --> 00:24:44.399
Mr. Rendell, um,

311
00:24:44.476 --> 00:24:48.003
did you consider the MOVE organization
to be a terrorist group?


312
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.607
They had demonstrated
a past history of violence.


313
00:24:51.684 --> 00:24:56.712
Uh, they had demonstrated
a willingness to use violence, force...


314
00:24:56.789 --> 00:25:00.885
or the threat of violence or force
to achieve their objectives.


315
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.555
It was almost difficult,
if not well nigh impossible,


316
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.928
to deal with them
in any rational basis...


317
00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:09.888
that their stated goals
as a group that was a


318
00:25:09.901 --> 00:25:12.801
back-to-nature group were,
frankly, a bunch of bull.


319
00:25:14.073 --> 00:25:17.099
People who have killed one person,

320
00:25:17.176 --> 00:25:20.737
injured several others, people who
threaten to blow up people's houses,


321
00:25:20.813 --> 00:25:24.772
people who threaten to shoot and kill
neighbors, police, elected officials-


322
00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:28.946
I think that's a pretty adequate
description of the word "terrorist."


323
00:26:05.357 --> 00:26:09.020
With every step of the way,
including the final act today,


324
00:26:09.094 --> 00:26:13.793
the police used commendable restraint,
uh, and it was done for many reasons.


325
00:26:13.866 --> 00:26:16.994
Most of all because of the children
who are present today.


326
00:26:17.069 --> 00:26:19.936
There had been much concern
on the part of many people...


327
00:26:20.005 --> 00:26:23.600
that the police would make
a violent assault on the MOVE members.


328
00:26:23.676 --> 00:26:27.112
As it turned out, the police
acted with precision and restraint.


329
00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:29.352
When one of the MOVE
members came out of the


330
00:26:29.365 --> 00:26:31.548
window with a cartridge
case in one hand,


331
00:26:31.617 --> 00:26:34.211
a clip and with
a knife in the other,

332
00:26:34.286 --> 00:26:37.221
he was hit on the top of the head
with a steel helmet...


333
00:26:37.289 --> 00:26:39.223
and was taken into custody.

334
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:41.384
That's what you're referring to.

335
00:26:50.703 --> 00:26:52.796
He's hittin' him. 
He's hittin' him.

336
00:26:52.871 --> 00:26:55.533
Hittin' him on the head.
Kickin' him on the head!


337
00:26:57.843 --> 00:26:59.811
I have no idea. 
I couldn't see.

338
00:26:59.878 --> 00:27:03.041
- Cops, you're makin' a mistake doin' that.
- Your ass they are.


339
00:27:05.484 --> 00:27:09.477
The police probably would have been
legally within their rights...


340
00:27:09.555 --> 00:27:12.718
to have killed all of the 12 people
in that basement.


341
00:27:14.093 --> 00:27:16.561
Do you believe
this is a symbolic gesture,


342
00:27:16.628 --> 00:27:20.223
tearing their house down at this point,
the very day of the shootout?


343
00:27:20.299 --> 00:27:23.234
I think behind it is
the question we gotta ask is why.


344
00:27:32.878 --> 00:27:37.247
There's a suspicion that some shots
had come from elsewhere.


345
00:27:37.316 --> 00:27:39.818
Walt Hunter from WCAU,
by the way, swears that


346
00:27:39.831 --> 00:27:42.344
a shot was fired going
in this direction.


347
00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:55.562
People who know us
know that we're not terrorists.


348
00:27:55.634 --> 00:27:59.832
We fight cops because they're dirty.
They're filthy. They're criminal.


349
00:28:00.873 --> 00:28:05.537
The sad part of it is
that this incident is not yet over.


350
00:28:05.611 --> 00:28:09.172
There will still be misguided voices
in the community...


351
00:28:10.249 --> 00:28:12.740
seeking clemency
for these criminals.


352
00:28:12.818 --> 00:28:15.810
Long live MOVE!
Long live revolution!


353
00:28:15.888 --> 00:28:20.382
Long live John Africa!
it's the MOVE organization.


354
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:42.376
What they should have done
is shot that goddamn bum,


355
00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:44.847
and then there would have been
no trouble today.


356
00:28:50.289 --> 00:28:53.850
This police department in Philadelphia
could invade Cuba and win.


357
00:28:54.426 --> 00:29:00.331
What I'm saying, Tom Snyder, is that we are
now trained and equipped to fight wars.


358
00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:05.632
Four more years, hell no!
No more Rizzo! Got to go!


359
00:29:05.704 --> 00:29:10.471
Four more years, hell no!
No more Rizzo! Got to go!


360
00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:12.874
Four more years, hell no!

361
00:29:19.151 --> 00:29:26.023
All of us, from all neighborhoods,
from all walks of life...


362
00:29:26.859 --> 00:29:30.556
can solve the problem
facing our city.


363
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.373
Leapheart was asked how he felt
when the verdict was read.


364
00:29:48.947 --> 00:29:51.370
What are your plans in
terms of staying in


365
00:29:51.383 --> 00:29:53.816
Philadelphia and trying to
continue the MOVE cult?


366
00:29:53.886 --> 00:29:56.218
It's not a cult.
It's an organization.


367
00:30:08.233 --> 00:30:11.725
When you appear to be different...

368
00:30:12.537 --> 00:30:14.903
you become angry,

369
00:30:14.973 --> 00:30:18.807
and you will do things
out of the norm.


370
00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:44.357
Did you ever think about leaving MOVE?

371
00:30:45.771 --> 00:30:46.931
Yeah.

372
00:30:47.005 --> 00:30:50.372
- Uh, when was that?
- A long time ago.


373
00:30:50.442 --> 00:30:53.536
A long time ago?
Why did you want to leave MOVE?


374
00:30:59.584 --> 00:31:02.712
'Cause we couldn't do
what other kids do.


375
00:31:02.788 --> 00:31:05.348
You couldn't do
what the other kids did?


376
00:31:07.125 --> 00:31:09.946
Uh, what were the other
children allowed to do


377
00:31:09.959 --> 00:31:12.791
who were outside of MOVE
that you couldn't do?


378
00:31:12.864 --> 00:31:17.130
Uh, play with toys and stuff
and ride bikes and watch TV.


379
00:31:18.704 --> 00:31:21.696
Did you tell anyone
that you wanted to leave?


380
00:31:23.208 --> 00:31:24.835
Who'd you tell?

381
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.573
Oh, we told-
We told each other.


382
00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:51.835
This is a blue-collar neighborhood.

383
00:31:53.138 --> 00:31:59.134
And any given summer day
you have the children,


384
00:31:59.211 --> 00:32:01.679
uh, playing in the streets.

385
00:32:03.148 --> 00:32:08.313
You have a mother
maybe sitting on the steps.


386
00:32:09.855 --> 00:32:11.345
Neighbors talking to each other.

387
00:32:12.958 --> 00:32:17.088
And all of a sudden
on their loudspeaker,


388
00:32:17.162 --> 00:32:20.859
you'd hear a voice
would come out and say,


389
00:32:20.932 --> 00:32:24.629
"You motherfuckers.
What the fuck are you doin' out here now?"


390
00:32:25.804 --> 00:32:27.863
Do you know
what's going on here?


391
00:32:27.939 --> 00:32:32.933
You son of a bitches around here
fuckin' everybody up.


392
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:34.603
"What the fuck is goin' on?"

393
00:32:36.848 --> 00:32:41.114
Anything that was vile,
they would go into it.


394
00:32:51.696 --> 00:32:54.790
The filth-it was-it was...

395
00:32:54.866 --> 00:32:59.860
unbelievable that something like this
could be in someone's mind.


396
00:33:00.972 --> 00:33:03.566
It's one thing to be two blocks away
and hear it.


397
00:33:03.642 --> 00:33:09.308
But to live right next door,
full blast in our bedroom.


398
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:12.578
I watched my wife many nights
lay there in that bed and cry.


399
00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:14.585
Wasn't nothin' else she could do.

400
00:33:14.653 --> 00:33:17.816
I think that, uh,
what we really hoped for...


401
00:33:17.889 --> 00:33:19.823
was that some kind of way...

402
00:33:19.891 --> 00:33:23.554
the city would find a way
to deal with the situation.


403
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:35.703
The only thing that was happening
is that MOVE was taking a stand...


404
00:33:35.774 --> 00:33:40.177
against the injustice that has
been dropped on them...


405
00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:44.944
by this administration
and the Rizzo administration.


406
00:33:45.016 --> 00:33:49.077
MOVE'S principle has never changed.

407
00:33:50.288 --> 00:33:54.987
MOVE'S mood,
I'm talking about bitterness now,


408
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.550
did change.

409
00:34:00.065 --> 00:34:04.126
They made, in my view,
a conscious decision...


410
00:34:05.103 --> 00:34:11.008
to aggravate residents to the point
was that the residents would, in fact,


411
00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:15.740
demand for the city to take actions
to provide them with relief.


412
00:34:16.648 --> 00:34:20.414
And in that regard, the city would be
forced into doing one of two things,


413
00:34:21.686 --> 00:34:25.452
to engage in confrontation
or to engage in compromise.


414
00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:29.851
There was a lot of hostility
between those two entities.


415
00:34:29.928 --> 00:34:32.829
I think it must be researched
why the hostility was there.


416
00:34:32.898 --> 00:34:34.832
Which two entities, Mr. Bond?

417
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.232
Uh, the city of Philadelphia
and the MOVE organization.


418
00:34:37.302 --> 00:34:40.362
And as a pawn,
we were caught in-between.


419
00:34:40.438 --> 00:34:43.032
And nobody, frankly, gave a damn.

420
00:34:53.785 --> 00:34:59.018
I met with 15 residents,
uh, of Osage Avenue...


421
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.526
on Memorial Day, 1984.

422
00:35:03.595 --> 00:35:05.722
At that meeting, 
I said to them...

423
00:35:05.797 --> 00:35:11.463
that I will research as to whether or not
there is a legal basis,


424
00:35:12.304 --> 00:35:17.867
uh, for the city to do something about
the problem that you have brought to us.


425
00:35:18.877 --> 00:35:21.277
But also pointed out to them...

426
00:35:21.346 --> 00:35:24.315
that the mayor does not
have the authority...


427
00:35:24.382 --> 00:35:28.819
because he does not like,
or the neighbors do not like,


428
00:35:28.887 --> 00:35:31.378
the way someone live...

429
00:35:31.456 --> 00:35:33.947
to simply go in and evict the people
from their house.


430
00:35:34.025 --> 00:35:37.927
We don't have those kinds of options
in this democracy.


431
00:35:43.235 --> 00:35:46.671
Today, more than three dozen Philadelphia
policemen surrounded the building...


432
00:35:46.738 --> 00:35:49.161
after a MOVE member was
spotted on the roof


433
00:35:49.174 --> 00:35:51.607
wearing a hooded mask
and carrying a shotgun.


434
00:35:51.676 --> 00:35:53.769
That standoff
lasted less than two hours.


435
00:35:53.845 --> 00:35:56.837
Police did not enter the house,
and no arrests were made.


436
00:35:56.915 --> 00:35:58.934
In the last several
weeks, their actions have


437
00:35:58.947 --> 00:36:00.976
escalated tensions in
the neighborhood...


438
00:36:01.052 --> 00:36:03.680
leading to tonight's situation.

439
00:36:04.256 --> 00:36:07.657
When the individual was on the roof
with the mask and the shotgun,


440
00:36:07.726 --> 00:36:10.320
my daughter was in our picture window.

441
00:36:10.996 --> 00:36:15.296
And she said, "Daddy, what is the man
doing on top of the roof with a gun?"


442
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.036
And I didn't have an answer.

443
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.174
She asked, "isn't that against the law?"

444
00:36:25.777 --> 00:36:27.711
And I said yes.

445
00:36:30.015 --> 00:36:32.722
Well, I don't know how
you can say that for


446
00:36:32.735 --> 00:36:35.453
a certain group of people,
the law applies...


447
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.353
and then another group of people,
that same law doesn't apply.


448
00:36:39.524 --> 00:36:43.460
I think we were in the law
on an equal basis, if I'm correct.


449
00:36:46.598 --> 00:36:51.661
You would see them dragging logs
from the park up the street.


450
00:36:51.736 --> 00:36:55.172
You could see that the line
in the street...


451
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:59.301
from, I guess, the oil out of the trees
that they would drag up.


452
00:36:59.377 --> 00:37:04.815
Wood would be stacked up
in front of the house at 6221.


453
00:37:04.883 --> 00:37:10.651
There was so much of it
that we requested that they...


454
00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:11.984
do something with it.

455
00:37:12.057 --> 00:37:14.082
What was the response
to that request?


456
00:37:14.159 --> 00:37:18.220
They responded
and put it on top of the roof.


457
00:37:23.568 --> 00:37:27.060
- We used to play on the roof.
- You used to play on the roof a lot?


458
00:37:27.138 --> 00:37:29.732
A lot of times.

459
00:37:29.808 --> 00:37:33.744
- Now, you said something about a bunker.
- Mm-hmm.


460
00:37:33.812 --> 00:37:36.713
How many bunkers were there
on the roof?


461
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:38.271
- Two.
- Two?


462
00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:41.717
And do you know
what they were made of?


463
00:37:50.895 --> 00:37:53.090
What kind of holes
did they have in the bunkers?


464
00:37:53.164 --> 00:37:58.124
Like the bunker was halfway over the
roof like this, and you could look down.


465
00:37:58.203 --> 00:38:01.604
You could see up the street
in the-all over.


466
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.930
Do you know what
those holes were for?


467
00:38:23.695 --> 00:38:29.224
That bunker you see there
is kind of a toyish-looking thing,


468
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:34.670
and I will tell you on Osage Avenue,
it commanded the scene.


469
00:38:35.607 --> 00:38:39.236
It overlooked and overpowered anything
you may-you can imagine.


470
00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.244
It was awesome.

471
00:38:42.213 --> 00:38:44.977
There's been talk that there
are explosives in this house.


472
00:38:45.049 --> 00:38:47.313
Uh, is there any truth to that?

473
00:38:47.385 --> 00:38:50.252
That's only people's,
you know, hallucination...


474
00:38:50.321 --> 00:38:52.118
because they have
not been inside this house.


475
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.124
So they would not know
what is in this house.


476
00:38:54.192 --> 00:38:58.720
What is in this house is the strategy
of John Africa that is very explosive.


477
00:38:59.697 --> 00:39:02.723
Is it a confrontation?
It most certainly is a confrontation,


478
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:06.703
one strategized by John Africa
years and years and years ago.


479
00:39:10.175 --> 00:39:13.372
Commissioner, could you tell us
what the lessons were...


480
00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:18.473
that you felt were learned in the 1978
confrontation from your point of view?


481
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:24.955
From my point of view, sir,
was that MOVE was a group...


482
00:39:25.023 --> 00:39:29.926
who was bent by virtue of their dogma
and by their actions...


483
00:39:29.994 --> 00:39:35.398
of destroying civilized activity...

484
00:39:35.467 --> 00:39:39.301
and ability to live in
a neighborhood peacefully.


485
00:39:41.506 --> 00:39:45.169
Tonight, there are growing concerns
about the controversial group, MOVE.


486
00:39:45.243 --> 00:39:48.508
City officials met today for the second
straight day to discuss strategy.


487
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.243
Sources reveal that Philadelphia's District
Attorney has now prepared the warrants...


488
00:39:52.317 --> 00:39:55.912
that are legally necessary to evict
MOVE members from their home.


489
00:39:55.987 --> 00:39:58.182
Once those warrants are signed by a judge,

490
00:39:58.256 --> 00:40:02.659
action by police to evict MOVE
could come at pretty much any time.


491
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.834
Do you know a police officer
by the name of Delores Thompson?


492
00:40:19.911 --> 00:40:21.401
Yes, I do.

493
00:40:21.913 --> 00:40:25.940
Do you recall telling her that your
son Frank was ordered to attack you,


494
00:40:26.651 --> 00:40:29.814
that you were beaten until
you started to vomit violently,


495
00:40:29.888 --> 00:40:32.448
that Frank then placed a pillow
over your face...


496
00:40:32.524 --> 00:40:37.086
and asked John Africa
if he wanted you to be cycled or killed...


497
00:40:37.161 --> 00:40:40.619
and that John Africa replied,
"Not at this time?"


498
00:40:40.698 --> 00:40:42.563
Did she tell you that I said that?

499
00:40:42.634 --> 00:40:46.400
- I have her report of that conversation, Mrs. James.
- Okay.


500
00:40:46.471 --> 00:40:48.871
Well, if she-Were you satisfied
with what she said?


501
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.374
- I'm asking you.
- Okay.


502
00:40:51.442 --> 00:40:54.240
I heard rumors to the effect
that my son had beaten me.


503
00:40:54.312 --> 00:40:56.547
I've also heard rumors
to the effect that


504
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.806
Wilson Goode put his
wife's jaw on a pulley,


505
00:40:58.883 --> 00:41:00.510
that he beat the hell out of her.

506
00:41:00.585 --> 00:41:04.521
Will you ask Mayor Goode that when he comes
in here if he in fact beat his wife?


507
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:06.420
And if not, why not?

508
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:10.951
If it is relevant that my son beat me
or whether or not he did beat me,


509
00:41:11.029 --> 00:41:13.150
then I would say it is
just as relevant for you


510
00:41:13.163 --> 00:41:15.295
to ask Wilson Goode
when he comes in here,


511
00:41:15.366 --> 00:41:16.697
"Did he beat his wife?"

512
00:41:16.768 --> 00:41:18.793
I don't think you're gonna
ask him that.


513
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:24.137
I really don't. But you should,
if you feel that it is relevant.


514
00:41:28.446 --> 00:41:33.645
Mr. Lytton, I just want to make it
clear in my mind so that I understand.


515
00:41:33.718 --> 00:41:38.155
Am I to assume that the bomb
was dropped on MOVE people...


516
00:41:38.222 --> 00:41:40.986
because Frank beat his mother?

517
00:41:41.059 --> 00:41:42.526
Ma'am, we're trying
to find out what happened,


518
00:41:42.594 --> 00:41:45.427
- and we'll continue asking questions.
- Oh. Okay.


519
00:42:06.818 --> 00:42:09.116
Of course, on Mother's Day,
the evacuation has been slow.


520
00:42:09.187 --> 00:42:10.677
People had plans for today.

521
00:42:10.755 --> 00:42:14.054
A few had decided that
they'd stay and not evacuate.


522
00:42:14.125 --> 00:42:16.394
But police have now
apparently advised those


523
00:42:16.407 --> 00:42:18.687
people that they think
it's best that they leave.


524
00:42:18.763 --> 00:42:22.893
I hope that it's resolved quickly...

525
00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:25.927
and have all confidence that the mayor's
going to be doing the right thing.


526
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:29.133
I wouldn't mind staying myself, you see.

527
00:42:29.207 --> 00:42:30.606
But I was told to leave...

528
00:42:30.675 --> 00:42:33.974
just 'cause he don't know what the
extent of this is going to be, you know.


529
00:42:34.045 --> 00:42:35.342
What do you think?

530
00:42:35.413 --> 00:42:40.373
I think-Believe it or not,
I think you'll have to kill all of them.


531
00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:45.815
And neighbors have been told by police not
to return to their homes for 24 hours.


532
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.949
That is 22:00 tomorrow night.

533
00:42:48.026 --> 00:42:51.792
Now, what will happen between now
and then remains to be seen, Charles.


534
00:42:51.863 --> 00:42:54.764
And, Casey, some of the neighbors,
as they were leaving, said to me...


535
00:42:54.832 --> 00:42:56.800
that as they were going,
leaving the neighborhood,


536
00:42:56.868 --> 00:42:59.268
the MOVE people were sitting out
in front of the MOVE house,


537
00:42:59.337 --> 00:43:00.895
the children in hand.

538
00:43:00.972 --> 00:43:05.875
Perhaps that was a subtle or not-so-subtle
indication of what's happening here.


539
00:43:06.778 --> 00:43:09.975
Did you consider, sir,
that at least in 1978,


540
00:43:10.048 --> 00:43:14.075
the members of the MOVE organization
who were at the Powelton Village house...


541
00:43:14.152 --> 00:43:19.681
had used their children, uh,
as if they were hostages?


542
00:43:19.757 --> 00:43:21.486
No, sir, I did not.

543
00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:24.790
You've said they came out
holding their children up as shields.


544
00:43:24.862 --> 00:43:27.092
Uh, I'm not an expert
in police science,


545
00:43:27.165 --> 00:43:29.565
but I think to the layman,

546
00:43:29.634 --> 00:43:32.501
that might suggest that they were
using their children as a hostage.


547
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:35.767
That's why I'm asking you
why you did not consider that.


548
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.537
They were using them simply as a ploy...

549
00:43:40.378 --> 00:43:43.677
and using that philosophy,

550
00:43:43.748 --> 00:43:47.479
that feeling that we had
for the sanctity of children...


551
00:43:47.552 --> 00:43:51.352
and everyone else,
to our disadvantage.


552
00:43:53.825 --> 00:43:57.386
I do not want to wake up tomorrow morning
and find myself short one son...


553
00:43:57.462 --> 00:43:59.868
because if this thing
kicks off, you're going


554
00:43:59.881 --> 00:44:02.297
to have bodies strewn
every which way.


555
00:44:02.366 --> 00:44:05.995
You're going to have children killed,
and you're going to have adults killed.


556
00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:11.007
I am very much afraid you're
going to have blood-soaked streets.


557
00:44:11.509 --> 00:44:15.445
Every one of us knew that there
was an extraordinarily high likelihood...


558
00:44:15.513 --> 00:44:17.003
that someone was going to die.

559
00:44:17.081 --> 00:44:19.481
We didn't know whether
it was going to be a policeman.


560
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.313
We didn't know whether
it was going to be a fireman.


561
00:44:21.385 --> 00:44:23.586
We didn't know whether it was
going to be a MOVE member.


562
00:44:23.654 --> 00:44:26.060
The worse dread of all
was that it was going


563
00:44:26.073 --> 00:44:28.489
to be a child or a
neighbor or a bystander.


564
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.087
I don't know if anyone on this panel
has ever had the responsibility...


565
00:44:33.164 --> 00:44:38.227
of saying "go" to a plan that you know
is going to cost human lives.


566
00:44:38.302 --> 00:44:41.396
Until you've done that,
it's very difficult to gauge...


567
00:44:41.472 --> 00:44:44.600
whether the city officials
were right or wrong in what they did.


568
00:44:45.877 --> 00:44:50.940
Did you all have meetings where you would
discuss what to do if the police came?


569
00:44:51.616 --> 00:44:54.517
Mm-mmm. Not us.

570
00:44:54.585 --> 00:44:57.452
Not the children?
How about the adults?


571
00:44:57.522 --> 00:44:59.513
How about the grown-ups?

572
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.923
They were to be upstairs by their self
when they had their meetings.


573
00:45:02.994 --> 00:45:04.928
When they had their meetings?

574
00:45:04.996 --> 00:45:07.328
How often
would they have their meetings?


575
00:45:07.398 --> 00:45:09.593
- A lot of times.
- A lot of times?


576
00:45:09.667 --> 00:45:14.627
Did you ever sit in on-Were you
ever in any of their meetings?


577
00:45:14.705 --> 00:45:17.367
Do you ever know what
went on in those meetings?


578
00:45:17.441 --> 00:45:18.908
Mm-mmm.

579
00:45:19.944 --> 00:45:22.310
What is a confrontation?
Do you know?


580
00:45:23.214 --> 00:45:24.511
Like it was.

581
00:45:24.582 --> 00:45:27.142
But what happens
when you have a confrontation?


582
00:45:27.218 --> 00:45:29.516
When the cops come and stuff.

583
00:45:57.315 --> 00:46:01.979
What did you believe they might have
had by way of firearms in that house?


584
00:46:02.053 --> 00:46:05.113
We were led to believe that
they had automatic firearms.


585
00:46:07.225 --> 00:46:08.920
Shotguns.

586
00:46:08.993 --> 00:46:11.154
I guess just as well
as equipped as we were.


587
00:46:11.229 --> 00:46:13.129
Mm-hmm.

588
00:46:13.197 --> 00:46:18.965
And so based on what you believed they
had, then you went prepared to match?


589
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:23.197
- To match or better than.
- Or to have superior?


590
00:46:23.274 --> 00:46:25.003
That's correct, sir.

591
00:46:27.345 --> 00:46:30.212
We interrupt regular programming
for this special report.


592
00:46:30.281 --> 00:46:33.739
I'm Dennis Woltering
with Harvey Clarke at 62nd and Vine...


593
00:46:33.818 --> 00:46:36.804
where authorities continue
preparations for an


594
00:46:36.817 --> 00:46:39.814
apparent confrontation with
the radical group, MOVE.


595
00:46:39.891 --> 00:46:42.223
Let me tell you what's happened
so far this morning.


596
00:46:42.293 --> 00:46:45.091
About two hours ago,

597
00:46:45.162 --> 00:46:48.598
utility crews moved into the area,
shut off gas and electricity.


598
00:46:48.666 --> 00:46:51.794
SWAT teams have been
converging on the area.


599
00:46:51.869 --> 00:46:56.272
You can see a fire truck behind me with
a deluge gun pointed back that way.


600
00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.467
It's aimed, apparently,
at the MOVE house.


601
00:46:58.542 --> 00:47:00.772
It looks like the scene is set.

602
00:47:15.459 --> 00:47:17.825
I got on my stomach,

603
00:47:17.895 --> 00:47:21.558
and with the bullhorn,
I read the message.


604
00:47:21.632 --> 00:47:24.658
And to be quite frank,
I was sweating it out.


605
00:47:25.536 --> 00:47:27.697
What did Commissioner Sambor
say, do you know?


606
00:47:27.772 --> 00:47:29.797
He was telling them to come out.

607
00:47:29.874 --> 00:47:32.001
Did you hear him saying that?

608
00:47:42.687 --> 00:47:45.622
What was the response
of the MOVE organization...


609
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.625
when you read the arrest warrant
that they vacate the premises?


610
00:47:48.693 --> 00:47:51.127
That they would not surrender.

611
00:47:51.195 --> 00:47:54.528
- Can you tell us what else they said?
- That they would kill us all.


612
00:47:54.598 --> 00:47:56.122
And what else did they say?

613
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.761
Uh, they said that, uh,

614
00:47:59.837 --> 00:48:02.305
that all of our wives would be widows.

615
00:48:02.373 --> 00:48:04.967
And what else did they say
about your wives?


616
00:48:06.544 --> 00:48:12.676
They said that our wives would be sleeping
with other men before the end of the day.


617
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.446
- Did they describe what other kind of men?
- Yes, sir.


618
00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:17.009
Would you tell us?

619
00:48:17.088 --> 00:48:21.752
They said that our wives would be sleeping
with black men before the end of the day.


620
00:48:21.826 --> 00:48:25.057
Do you recall what your reaction was
to those statements?


621
00:48:25.129 --> 00:48:30.465
I accepted it, sir,
as some of their rhetoric...


622
00:48:30.534 --> 00:48:35.938
and attempts to incite the police
and myself to precipitous action.


623
00:48:51.555 --> 00:48:54.080
The police went in
about five minutes to 6:00.


624
00:48:54.158 --> 00:48:56.126
Just four minutes ago,
they pumped tear gas in...


625
00:48:56.193 --> 00:48:58.093
which ls in the area.

626
00:48:58.162 --> 00:49:02.758
The police began a deluge,
which you can see here.


627
00:49:02.833 --> 00:49:04.596
That water's actually
being pumped in...


628
00:49:04.668 --> 00:49:09.196
about, probably, 50 yards
into the MOVE compound.


629
00:49:10.608 --> 00:49:13.668
As you can see up the street,
Tom, if you just pan up there,


630
00:49:13.744 --> 00:49:18.147
it's a very surreal kind of scene.

631
00:49:18.215 --> 00:49:20.581
Very calm men standing around...

632
00:49:20.651 --> 00:49:25.213
as the cloud of tear gas,
the haze, kind of begins to lift.


633
00:49:25.289 --> 00:49:28.019
Here comes some more tear gas
down Addison Street.


634
00:49:28.092 --> 00:49:31.186
This apparently has expanded...

635
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:35.628
to include the entire square block.

636
00:49:35.699 --> 00:49:39.430
Perhaps when the cloud clears,
we'll know a little bit more.


637
00:49:42.373 --> 00:49:47.310
What was the plan
for May 13, 1985?


638
00:49:47.378 --> 00:49:51.439
The tactical plan, as I understood it,

639
00:49:51.515 --> 00:49:56.475
was to remove the MOVE people,
all the people,


640
00:49:56.554 --> 00:49:58.215
from the house safely.

641
00:49:58.289 --> 00:50:00.348
That was the objective.

642
00:50:00.424 --> 00:50:06.659
It was to be done by causing
a diversion on the roof,


643
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:10.427
inserting the insertion teams
on either side of the properties...


644
00:50:11.702 --> 00:50:17.140
and by then inducing
an amount of C.S. gas...


645
00:50:17.208 --> 00:50:18.869
in a sufficient concentration...

646
00:50:20.611 --> 00:50:23.580
to make those people
come out of the house.


647
00:50:24.415 --> 00:50:29.978
The police presence here
is not like it was the last time.


648
00:50:30.054 --> 00:50:32.955
This is being handled
almost entirely by the stakeout unit.


649
00:50:33.023 --> 00:50:35.321
There may have just been a gunshot.

650
00:50:35.392 --> 00:50:37.519
The gunshots are starting right now.

651
00:50:37.595 --> 00:50:40.894
It sounds like automatic fire, Steve.
There's quite a bit of it.


652
00:50:40.965 --> 00:50:44.005
We can't tell, Steve, at this point
exactly where the gunfire is coming from.


653
00:50:45.603 --> 00:50:50.006
Okay. Steve, at this point we're
being forced to leave our position.


654
00:50:50.074 --> 00:50:52.201
- We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
- Let's go.


655
00:50:52.276 --> 00:50:54.244
The police
are now moving Harvey Clarke.


656
00:50:54.311 --> 00:50:56.643
- Who shot first?
- They did.


657
00:50:56.714 --> 00:50:59.808
- How do you know?
- Because I was there.


658
00:50:59.884 --> 00:51:02.375
I understand that.
Did you see muzzle fire?


659
00:51:02.453 --> 00:51:05.650
- I'm just trying to determine how you have that knowledge.
- No, sir, I did not.


660
00:51:05.723 --> 00:51:11.355
But one of the other teams reported
that they were receiving hostile fire.


661
00:51:11.428 --> 00:51:14.556
- Did it sound like automatic fire to you?
- It did. Yes, sir.


662
00:51:14.632 --> 00:51:17.931
And I take it you're familiar
with the sound of automatic weapons fire.


663
00:51:18.002 --> 00:51:19.765
I've heard automatic-
Yes, sir.


664
00:51:22.072 --> 00:51:25.166
Pat, as you can see, we have
reestablished our live signal.


665
00:51:25.242 --> 00:51:28.837
Tremendous bursts of gunfire
have rang out...


666
00:51:28.913 --> 00:51:31.575
in the area
of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue.


667
00:51:31.649 --> 00:51:34.584
Walt Hunter has joined me.
And, Walter, what have you learned?


668
00:51:34.652 --> 00:51:36.643
We have heard
several popping sounds here...


669
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:39.211
indicating that gunfire
is getting much, much closer.


670
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:41.178
But we don't know if the
guns you're hearing


671
00:51:41.191 --> 00:51:43.090
are police guns, MOVE
guns or other guns.


672
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.424
About the only thing
we can confirm for you at this point...


673
00:51:45.496 --> 00:51:48.954
is that clearly, based on the nature of the
shoot-out we're seeing here this morning,


674
00:51:49.033 --> 00:51:52.525
MOVE did have some weaponry
either in the house or nearby.


675
00:52:03.547 --> 00:52:05.071
As you know, Commissioner,

676
00:52:05.149 --> 00:52:08.550
there were no automatic weapons
found in the MOVE house.


677
00:52:08.619 --> 00:52:11.554
Do you know whether or not
the automatic weapons fire you heard...


678
00:52:11.622 --> 00:52:13.817
was in fact from police officers?

679
00:52:15.693 --> 00:52:21.427
The firing, as initiated by MOVE,

680
00:52:21.498 --> 00:52:23.659
uh, was...

681
00:52:25.636 --> 00:52:30.005
apparently automatic fire,

682
00:52:30.074 --> 00:52:32.406
and I cannot explain it.

683
00:52:32.476 --> 00:52:37.470
But I do not believe for one minute...

684
00:52:37.548 --> 00:52:41.507
that it was the police
that were firing at that time.


685
00:52:42.886 --> 00:52:45.946
Once the MOVE members started firing,

686
00:52:46.023 --> 00:52:48.583
their status changed radically
in the eyes of the law.


687
00:52:48.659 --> 00:52:51.093
They at that point
became forcible felons,


688
00:52:51.161 --> 00:52:53.493
and there's a whole
different set of laws...


689
00:52:53.564 --> 00:52:56.465
as to the apprehension
and the amount of force that can be used...


690
00:52:56.533 --> 00:53:01.129
in the apprehension of and the prevention
of the escape of forcible felons.


691
00:53:01.205 --> 00:53:03.935
- Including the children?
- No.


692
00:53:04.008 --> 00:53:05.703
That's as to the adults.

693
00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:08.539
We went downstairs.

694
00:53:08.612 --> 00:53:12.048
Did the adults tell you
to go downstairs?


695
00:53:12.116 --> 00:53:14.380
And where did you go
when you went downstairs?


696
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:16.316
- The garage.
- Into the garage?


697
00:53:16.387 --> 00:53:19.652
- But where were the men?
- They were upstairs.


698
00:53:19.723 --> 00:53:21.714
Do you know
what they were doing?


699
00:53:31.802 --> 00:53:35.636
Now, we know that the children
wasn't doing any shooting.


700
00:53:35.706 --> 00:53:38.907
- Do you feel that their rights-
- I did not know that the children were not shooting.


701
00:53:38.942 --> 00:53:42.673
What-Would you say that if we had children
in there four, five, six years old...


702
00:53:42.746 --> 00:53:44.873
that they would have been using
any type of weapons?


703
00:53:44.948 --> 00:53:48.315
To my knowledge,
there was only one that young.


704
00:53:51.622 --> 00:53:53.174
We would like to tell you
that the shoot-out is over.


705
00:53:53.187 --> 00:53:54.750
We cannot say that definitively.

706
00:53:54.825 --> 00:53:57.692
We can say there's been at least a 15-
or 20-minute break in the gunfights.


707
00:53:57.761 --> 00:54:01.219
Here comes a police car
racing in right now at this moment.


708
00:54:01.298 --> 00:54:04.631
This is a highway patrol car
racing into the scene.


709
00:54:04.702 --> 00:54:06.397
We don't know
what this signifies.


710
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:09.837
We'd like to tell you it's over. We really
can't right now. There has been a pause.


711
00:54:09.907 --> 00:54:12.967
There are indications that what has been
a tremendous gunfight is over.


712
00:54:13.043 --> 00:54:14.943
Looking in the trunk of this car
right here.


713
00:54:15.012 --> 00:54:17.845
There's more gunfire right now.
We're gonna crouch down.


714
00:54:17.915 --> 00:54:21.146
As you were about to say, the police are
unloading, as you can see right now.


715
00:54:21.218 --> 00:54:24.210
The police are unloading
Winchester cartridge shells...


716
00:54:24.288 --> 00:54:26.950
from the back
of a highway patrol car.


717
00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:31.551
Do you know how many rounds
were fired that day?


718
00:54:31.628 --> 00:54:33.425
No, sir.

719
00:54:33.497 --> 00:54:38.093
But I will say that, uh-
uh, we ran out.


720
00:54:40.904 --> 00:54:44.362
Uh, we did not anticipate,

721
00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:50.903
uh, the extent
of the confrontation,


722
00:54:50.981 --> 00:54:52.812
uh, and ran out.

723
00:54:52.883 --> 00:54:57.343
Uh, I don't know what time it was,
but it was some time in the morning.


724
00:55:01.725 --> 00:55:04.057
What's happening is,
it's a shoot-out.


725
00:55:04.128 --> 00:55:08.531
Oh, man, and those kids and all that-

726
00:55:16.974 --> 00:55:21.070
The gunfire is as close as it's been since
the shoot-out happened this morning.


727
00:55:21.145 --> 00:55:22.669
Let's
-Let's come closer.

728
00:55:22.746 --> 00:55:27.308
Let's come closer and use-and crouch
down behind the Eyewitness News truck.


729
00:55:31.989 --> 00:55:34.685
Oh, my God!

730
00:55:46.003 --> 00:55:48.528
Get down, lady. Get down. Yeah.

731
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:55.101
Stay in the house.
Stay inside.


732
00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.871
I heard shots being fired,
and cops was in the alleyway.


733
00:55:58.949 --> 00:56:00.746
They was like,
"Get in the house. Don't come out."


734
00:56:00.818 --> 00:56:02.513
I was very, very frightened.

735
00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:04.076
You supposed
to nip something in the bud.


736
00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:05.593
If you see something's
coming, you're supposed


737
00:56:05.606 --> 00:56:07.055
to sit down and try
to iron it out...


738
00:56:07.124 --> 00:56:09.524
before something like this
comes to this stage.


739
00:56:09.593 --> 00:56:12.061
It's war. This is war.

740
00:56:12.129 --> 00:56:14.169
I've never seen it,
but I've lived through it today.


741
00:56:28.278 --> 00:56:29.939
This woman
-We can't determine...

742
00:56:30.013 --> 00:56:34.450
whether she is a relative of one
of the MOVE members or not.


743
00:56:34.518 --> 00:56:37.146
It appeared that things
had gotten calm.


744
00:56:37.221 --> 00:56:41.715
And then as you heard, about a minute and
a half ago, another burst of gunfire.


745
00:56:41.792 --> 00:56:44.283
This woman is now being taken
into police custody.


746
00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:46.795
You're watching it live.
They are restraining her.


747
00:56:46.864 --> 00:56:51.233
She is hysterical and is clearly upset
about what's going on in there.


748
00:56:51.301 --> 00:56:54.668
Just trying to get her out of the danger
area where we are on the fringes right now.


749
00:56:55.973 --> 00:56:57.941
Did you have a concern...

750
00:56:58.008 --> 00:57:00.772
that the people
inside of that house...


751
00:57:00.844 --> 00:57:04.109
might be in physical danger
or that their lives might be in danger?


752
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:06.741
Concern?
We knew it.


753
00:57:06.817 --> 00:57:08.307
- Miss-
- We-Excuse me.


754
00:57:08.385 --> 00:57:12.845
We had-
You had 200 boot-kicking,


755
00:57:12.923 --> 00:57:17.155
Gestapo-oriented cops
out there that day.


756
00:57:17.227 --> 00:57:22.927
You had, that day, a police officer
by the name of Mulvihill...


757
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.530
who was in the 1978, uh, tragedy...

758
00:57:29.606 --> 00:57:35.567
who was, in fact, one of the
officers who stomped and kicked...


759
00:57:35.646 --> 00:57:38.376
and beat and bludgeoned...

760
00:57:38.448 --> 00:57:42.885
and shot and helmeted
and kicked some more...


761
00:57:42.953 --> 00:57:45.547
my brother, Delbert Africa.

762
00:57:45.622 --> 00:57:48.318
So as I understand
your testimony,


763
00:57:48.392 --> 00:57:50.257
you were concerned
that there may be physical harm...


764
00:57:50.327 --> 00:57:52.557
to the people inside that house,
is that correct?


765
00:57:52.629 --> 00:57:54.392
Would you turn up
your hearing aid, please?


766
00:57:54.464 --> 00:57:56.125
I can hear you fine, Mrs. James.

767
00:57:56.199 --> 00:57:57.826
- My question is-
- Well, then if you can hear me fine,


768
00:57:57.901 --> 00:58:00.563
if you don't have a hearing aid,
I suggest you get one.


769
00:58:00.637 --> 00:58:02.127
- Well, because-
- Excuse me!


770
00:58:02.205 --> 00:58:03.297
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:58:03.373 --> 00:58:05.534
To ask me...

772
00:58:05.609 --> 00:58:11.138
"were we concerned"
is complete insanity.


773
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:26.527
By virtue of the fact that MOVE
had construction on the roof...


774
00:58:26.597 --> 00:58:29.498
that was commonly
referred to as the bunker,


775
00:58:29.566 --> 00:58:35.596
that gave them complete command
of the Osage Avenue,


776
00:58:35.672 --> 00:58:38.607
access over the roofs...

777
00:58:39.576 --> 00:58:43.444
they were in an enviable tactical position.

778
00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:46.941
The water cannon used
during the MOVE standoff today...


779
00:58:47.017 --> 00:58:50.680
shoots an estimated

780
00:58:50.754 --> 00:58:53.655
Sources say the purpose
of the water is threefold.


781
00:58:53.724 --> 00:58:56.625
First, to disorient
the people inside the house.


782
00:58:56.693 --> 00:59:01.528
Secondly, the water increases humidity,
which makes tear gas more effective.


783
00:59:01.598 --> 00:59:06.262
Thirdly, the powerful water pressure
could cause the house to collapse.


784
00:59:08.238 --> 00:59:13.767
If that plan relied solely on the ability
of our equipment to knock the bunker off,


785
00:59:13.844 --> 00:59:18.008
they knew very clearly up front
that we could not guarantee that, sir.


786
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.326
Chris, I saw Police Commissioner
Gregore Sambor about 45 minutes ago,


787
00:59:34.398 --> 00:59:37.492
and he described his men
as, quote, "taking a break now."


788
00:59:37.567 --> 00:59:40.337
They're obviously somewhat
startled by the way that


789
00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:43.130
MOVE'S building at 62 and
Osage was fortified...


790
00:59:43.206 --> 00:59:47.700
and able to take the water barrage and the
bullets that flew in there this morning.


791
00:59:47.778 --> 00:59:49.370
Thousands of rounds spun off.

792
00:59:49.446 --> 00:59:52.415
Larry, for the first time,
it's been quiet for several hours here.


793
00:59:52.482 --> 00:59:54.569
The police helicopter did
go back up, and I guess


794
00:59:54.582 --> 00:59:56.680
they wanted to take a look
at the top of the bunker.


795
00:59:56.753 --> 00:59:59.210
We had reports-What you
see in front there,


796
00:59:59.223 --> 01:00:01.690
the yellow tarp is the front
of that building,


797
01:00:01.758 --> 01:00:04.090
and we were told
that that bunker was destroyed.


798
01:00:04.161 --> 01:00:05.753
But it appears that it's still there.

799
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:08.525
Okay, Harvey.
They stopped the snorkel gun now.


800
01:00:08.598 --> 01:00:13.035
- There's no water on that roof.
- For some time, the water has been turned off.


801
01:00:13.103 --> 01:00:14.968
At City Hall this afternoon,

802
01:00:15.038 --> 01:00:17.370
Mayor Goode appeared publicly for the
first time since the siege began.


803
01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:21.309
Goode said he's committed
to removing MOVE from the structure.


804
01:00:21.378 --> 01:00:23.573
We intend to evict from the house.

805
01:00:23.647 --> 01:00:27.447
We intend to evacuate from the house, and
we intend to seize control of the house.


806
01:00:27.517 --> 01:00:32.250
- How will you do that?
- We will do it by any means necessary.


807
01:00:41.064 --> 01:00:43.055
Something is starting to happen.

808
01:00:43.133 --> 01:00:46.466
There is a big-
The fire engine has fired up again.


809
01:00:46.536 --> 01:00:49.061
Its engine is on
for the first time all afternoon.


810
01:00:49.139 --> 01:00:52.666
We just saw some police officers behind
us have their hands over their ears.


811
01:00:52.743 --> 01:00:55.473
We don't know why.
We can't hear anything at this point.


812
01:00:55.545 --> 01:00:58.070
I must say that this
tiny little flurry of activity...


813
01:00:58.148 --> 01:01:01.083
is really the first bit of activity
that there's been here all afternoon.


814
01:01:01.151 --> 01:01:02.641
It's been very quiet.

815
01:01:02.719 --> 01:01:05.950
Police say that they have a plan.
They say it will be implemented shortly.


816
01:01:06.022 --> 01:01:07.853
We will tell you what
it is when it happens.


817
01:01:07.924 --> 01:01:12.486
Reporting live from 62nd and Delancey, this
is Chris Wagner, Channel 6 Action News.


818
01:01:29.179 --> 01:01:32.580
This device that was used-
You're calling it a device.


819
01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:35.516
I'm calling it a bomb.
But did it ever occur to you...


820
01:01:35.585 --> 01:01:38.355
that this might have
been a dangerous device


821
01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:41.148
to use in a residential
neighborhood?


822
01:01:41.224 --> 01:01:42.885
Yes, ma'am.

823
01:01:42.959 --> 01:01:46.122
- It did occur to you?
- Yes, ma'am.


824
01:01:48.799 --> 01:01:50.289
By not vetoing it,

825
01:01:50.367 --> 01:01:53.632
did you approve the plan
to use an explosive on the roof?


826
01:01:53.703 --> 01:01:58.299
I think that I was fully aware
that it would, in fact, be used,


827
01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:02.277
and it is my view
that you can regard that...


828
01:02:02.345 --> 01:02:05.644
as an approval of using
the explosive on the roof, yes.


829
01:02:20.964 --> 01:02:25.298
...right there in a 10-15 foot hover
above the roof.


830
01:02:25.368 --> 01:02:29.634
And I was right on the left-hand side
of the helicopter right here.


831
01:02:29.706 --> 01:02:33.005
Onto this corner
is where I finally came to a stop.


832
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:09.078
You were down in the garage,
is that right?


833
01:03:09.145 --> 01:03:14.105
We was down there for a while,
and then everybody came down.


834
01:03:14.184 --> 01:03:18.484
- All the men came down?
- That's when the big bomb went off.


835
01:03:29.733 --> 01:03:31.997
It shook the whole house up.

836
01:03:36.473 --> 01:03:38.634
Police say there has just been
a huge explosion here.


837
01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:41.609
We don't know what it means,
but it just shook the whole place.


838
01:03:41.678 --> 01:03:45.239
Debris flew all over the place.
I don't know what that explosion was.


839
01:03:45.315 --> 01:03:48.011
All I can tell you
is that it was a huge blast.


840
01:03:48.084 --> 01:03:49.676
Get a shot with me.
Get a sh-


841
01:03:49.753 --> 01:03:52.673
- Harvey, can you hear us?
- At this point, I really can't tell you very much.


842
01:03:52.722 --> 01:03:56.180
There was about a 15-second delay,
then an explosion.


843
01:03:56.259 --> 01:03:58.779
Perhaps the most frightening thing here
is that police do say...


844
01:03:58.795 --> 01:04:01.476
that six to eight children are believed
to be inside the MOVE house.


845
01:04:01.531 --> 01:04:04.329
As soon as we find out what the
explosion is, we will try to tell you.


846
01:04:04.401 --> 01:04:06.335
At this point, 
I simply do not know.

847
01:04:08.672 --> 01:04:11.938
After the explosion, you saw that the
bunker was still there.


848
01:04:11.963 --> 01:04:13.008
Yes, sir.

849
01:04:13.009 --> 01:04:14.965
Did you observe any smoke
or fire on the roof?


850
01:04:14.978 --> 01:04:16.945
I did not.

851
01:04:17.013 --> 01:04:20.642
And-I did hear over the
radio that there was none.


852
01:04:45.108 --> 01:04:50.239
It's easy to equate explosions
and explosive materials with fire.


853
01:04:50.313 --> 01:04:51.803
But that's not necessarily so.

854
01:04:51.881 --> 01:04:53.609
'Cause I think we've
all seen buildings


855
01:04:53.622 --> 01:04:55.361
demolished, and it's used
all the time in mining.


856
01:04:55.385 --> 01:04:58.582
So I don't think you
can just logically conclude...


857
01:04:58.655 --> 01:05:02.386
if you're going to have an explosion,
you're going to have a fire.


858
01:05:02.459 --> 01:05:05.690
There's no more smoke. And at this
point, looking over my shoulder,


859
01:05:05.762 --> 01:05:09.823
the water barrage appears
to have ended again.


860
01:05:28.818 --> 01:05:32.345
Okay, there is a new development
at the MOVE building, 62nd and Osage.


861
01:05:32.422 --> 01:05:34.720
We'll go live right away
to Harvey Clarke at the scene.


862
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:37.521
- What's going on, Harvey?
- Larry, behind me you can probably see right now-


863
01:05:37.594 --> 01:05:39.357
We'll push and try
to get a little tighter shot of it-


864
01:05:39.429 --> 01:05:43.388
that the satchel charge, or whatever-
the explosive or bomb...


865
01:05:43.466 --> 01:05:45.991
that was dropped on the MOVE compound
just a few minutes ago...


866
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:48.299
has apparently started
a serious fire.


867
01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:52.273
But the two deluge guns or sprinklers...

868
01:05:52.342 --> 01:05:56.506
that they've been pumping water in
from Pine Street are not active now.


869
01:05:57.847 --> 01:06:01.339
I wanted to get the bunker.

870
01:06:01.418 --> 01:06:07.254
I wanted to be able to
somehow have tactical superiority...


871
01:06:07.323 --> 01:06:12.386
without sacrificing any lives,
if it were at all possible.


872
01:06:14.564 --> 01:06:17.124
Commissioner Sambor said to me.

873
01:06:18.168 --> 01:06:20.568
He said let's let the bunker burn...

874
01:06:20.637 --> 01:06:24.539
to eliminate that high ground advantage
and the tactical advantage of the bunker.


875
01:06:24.607 --> 01:06:26.097
And I said, "Yeah, okay."

876
01:06:26.176 --> 01:06:28.474
it was not an order.

877
01:06:28.545 --> 01:06:30.843
In essence, in communication-

878
01:06:30.914 --> 01:06:35.408
I communicated to him
that I would like to let the fire burn.


879
01:06:49.599 --> 01:06:51.440
Larry, this is becoming
a very emotional scene.


880
01:06:51.501 --> 01:06:53.128
With me is Janice Walker.

881
01:06:53.203 --> 01:06:55.728
She lives at 6217 Osage,

882
01:06:55.805 --> 01:06:58.603
- just two doors from the MOVE house.
- Yes.


883
01:06:58.675 --> 01:07:00.734
And you're afraid
that your house may be on fire.


884
01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:03.745
I'm sure it's just destroyed,
and it's just not fair.


885
01:07:03.813 --> 01:07:07.340
We've been there over 20 years, and we
didn't have to have to go through this.


886
01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:10.853
We only left with a few odds
and ends, you know, for the night.


887
01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.787
We had no idea it was
gonna be this devastating.


888
01:07:13.857 --> 01:07:16.826
You've got innocent people that
live around there on Osage Avenue,


889
01:07:16.893 --> 01:07:18.690
and they just, you know-

890
01:07:18.761 --> 01:07:21.559
Their properties have just
gone up in smoke.


891
01:07:32.408 --> 01:07:36.902
I saw initially a
small fire on the roof.

892
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.949
I saw what appeared...

893
01:07:40.016 --> 01:07:44.146
to be some water coming in.

894
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:46.780
I determined later
that that was not water at all...


895
01:07:46.856 --> 01:07:52.590
but was basically the kind of snow
on my television screen.


896
01:07:52.662 --> 01:07:55.256
And after about five minutes
of watching that,


897
01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:59.267
I gave what was
my first order of the day,


898
01:07:59.335 --> 01:08:01.326
which was "put the fire out."

899
01:08:02.038 --> 01:08:07.066
You are aware that
the mayor has testified...


900
01:08:07.143 --> 01:08:12.410
that at approximately 6:00
on the evening of May 13,


901
01:08:12.482 --> 01:08:15.940
he ordered that the fire be put out.

902
01:08:16.019 --> 01:08:18.852
I heard the testimony, yes, sir.

903
01:08:21.491 --> 01:08:24.551
Do you know whether or not...

904
01:08:24.627 --> 01:08:28.927
there had been any order
to put the fire out?


905
01:08:31.568 --> 01:08:33.593
Yes, sir.

906
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:37.367
- Did you convey that order to anyone else?
- Yes, sir.


907
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.433
- To whom?
- The fire commissioner was still there.


908
01:08:42.478 --> 01:08:44.241
To whom?

909
01:08:44.314 --> 01:08:47.647
The fire commissioner was still there.

910
01:08:48.651 --> 01:08:52.143
- Those responses were Commissioner Sambor, sir?
- Yes, sir.


911
01:08:52.222 --> 01:08:53.712
I categorically deny that.

912
01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:56.782
I had no knowledge
of an order to extinguish that fire.


913
01:09:43.072 --> 01:09:46.974
Was there any smoke or tear gas
in the garage when you were down there?


914
01:09:47.043 --> 01:09:49.534
- Or was there tear gas?
- It was smoke and tear gas.


915
01:09:49.612 --> 01:09:51.102
Smoke and tear gas?

916
01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:55.014
Did it bother you? Did it burn
your eyes or anything?


917
01:09:55.084 --> 01:09:56.813
And what did you all do?

918
01:09:56.886 --> 01:09:59.514
We was under the blanket
with our heads.


919
01:09:59.589 --> 01:10:01.784
- Were all the kids under blankets?
- Mm-hmm.


920
01:10:01.858 --> 01:10:04.656
- Where were the women?
- Under blankets.


921
01:10:04.727 --> 01:10:07.787
They were under blankets?
Now, you said the blankets were wet.


922
01:10:07.864 --> 01:10:08.853
Mm-hmm.

923
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:12.958
- How did the blankets get wet?
- 'Cause we had 'em in the bucket.


924
01:10:13.036 --> 01:10:14.628
Bucket of water.

925
01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:25.276
Isn't it true, Commissioner Sambor
and fire Commissioner Richmond,


926
01:10:25.348 --> 01:10:32.015
that you in effect made a decision
to use fire as a weapon in this instance?


927
01:10:32.088 --> 01:10:34.556
Absolutely not, sir.

928
01:10:36.326 --> 01:10:42.595
Well, you made a decision to let that
fire burn until the bunker was destroyed.


929
01:10:42.665 --> 01:10:44.599
- Isn't that right?
- When you talk about a weapon,


930
01:10:44.667 --> 01:10:48.467
you talk about a weapon as being
used against probably individuals,


931
01:10:48.538 --> 01:10:53.134
and that was never a consideration
nor would I ever use it as a consideration.


932
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:55.439
Well, fire Commissioner Richmond,

933
01:10:55.511 --> 01:10:58.480
what did you understand the police
commissioner was asking you to do?


934
01:10:58.548 --> 01:11:01.016
I would respond in the same way,
Justice Kaufmann.


935
01:11:01.084 --> 01:11:03.004
There is no one that I know
in city government...


936
01:11:03.019 --> 01:11:06.614
that would intentionally go out there
to burn those people like that.


937
01:11:06.689 --> 01:11:08.680
There's no one that I know of
could do that.


938
01:11:32.882 --> 01:11:36.978
You were aware in 1978, I assume,

939
01:11:37.053 --> 01:11:40.045
that a situation had developed...

940
01:11:40.123 --> 01:11:44.287
involving certain police officers
and Delbert Africa?


941
01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.952
Yes, sir.

942
01:11:46.028 --> 01:11:47.518
Did you give any instructions...

943
01:11:47.597 --> 01:11:50.185
as to whether or not
the officers who were


944
01:11:50.198 --> 01:11:52.796
specifically involved
in that altercation...


945
01:11:52.869 --> 01:11:58.330
should or should not be included
in the operation for May 13, 1985?


946
01:11:58.408 --> 01:12:00.273
I did not.

947
01:12:00.343 --> 01:12:07.112
Weren't you concerned that there
might be some revenge motive...


948
01:12:07.183 --> 01:12:11.643
which may take the police action
beyond the legal limits?


949
01:12:11.721 --> 01:12:13.706
I think there's no question
there was, at least


950
01:12:13.719 --> 01:12:15.714
on the part of some
policemen, residual anger...


951
01:12:15.792 --> 01:12:19.421
towards MOVE organization
or members thereof.


952
01:12:19.495 --> 01:12:20.985
No question about that.

953
01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.728
Would the court reporter
please swear in the witnesses?


954
01:12:26.803 --> 01:12:28.071
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth, the


955
01:12:28.084 --> 01:12:29.363
whole truth and nothing
but the truth...


956
01:12:29.439 --> 01:12:31.930
- so help you God?
- I do.


957
01:12:32.008 --> 01:12:37.810
Officer D'Ulisse, 
I understand that in

958
01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.544
during an altercation
that occurred with Delbert Africa.


959
01:12:42.618 --> 01:12:44.176
Yes.

960
01:12:44.253 --> 01:12:45.845
And officer Mulvihill?

961
01:12:45.922 --> 01:12:49.187
What does that have to do
with May the 13th?


962
01:12:49.258 --> 01:12:51.419
The officer was tried and found
not guilty of that offense.


963
01:12:51.494 --> 01:12:54.156
That was going to be
my next statement, Mr. Mozenter.


964
01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:58.326
Officer, we understand that you were
charged in connection with that case,


965
01:12:58.401 --> 01:13:01.370
and also we understand
that there was a direct


966
01:13:01.383 --> 01:13:04.362
verdict by Judge Dibona of
not guilty in that case.


967
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.567
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.


968
01:13:08.077 --> 01:13:10.295
Stakeout police have just
taken position.


969
01:13:10.308 --> 01:13:12.537
There must be movement
somewhere in the Osage,


970
01:13:12.615 --> 01:13:19.179
and they're all scattering
between 62nd and Osage and 63rd.


971
01:13:19.255 --> 01:13:21.951
They're running around like
something's going on around here.


972
01:13:22.024 --> 01:13:25.516
These are live pictures.
They are looking for something there.


973
01:13:25.595 --> 01:13:29.087
You can hear hollering. Where it was
coming from, Larry, I don't know.


974
01:13:30.566 --> 01:13:33.057
When the fire got real heavy,

975
01:13:33.135 --> 01:13:35.399
when we smelled all that smoke,
and we couldn't breathe,


976
01:13:35.471 --> 01:13:38.998
then that's when we started
yelling that "kids coming out,"


977
01:13:39.075 --> 01:13:45.776
and then they opened the garage door
and opened the cellar window.


978
01:13:45.848 --> 01:13:47.679
What did you say?
What did you yell?


979
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:50.685
We were saying,
"We wanna come out!"


980
01:13:50.753 --> 01:13:52.778
"We wanna come out?"

981
01:13:52.855 --> 01:13:55.551
And what did the other children do?
Did they do the same thing?


982
01:13:55.625 --> 01:13:56.956
Yeah.

983
01:13:57.026 --> 01:14:01.463
- Were any of the children crying?
- Yeah. We all was.


984
01:14:02.965 --> 01:14:07.595
- Why had you all gone to the back alley?
- To prevent the escape of MOVE members.


985
01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:09.865
Well, what did you expect
to find in that alley,


986
01:14:09.939 --> 01:14:12.237
the reason why you took
a machine gun back there?


987
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:16.703
I had no idea what
to expect in the alley.

988
01:14:22.752 --> 01:14:24.743
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...


989
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:27.220
- and nothing but the truth so help you God?
- I do.


990
01:14:31.027 --> 01:14:35.225
Your vantage point
was to the back of 6221.


991
01:14:35.298 --> 01:14:36.925
- Is that correct?
- Yes.


992
01:14:36.999 --> 01:14:39.729
All right.
Was there any time...


993
01:14:39.802 --> 01:14:43.568
that you observed
either with your eyes or your ears...


994
01:14:43.639 --> 01:14:46.130
people attempting
to come out of that house?


995
01:14:46.943 --> 01:14:51.778
I heard a female scream,
"Don't shoot. We're coming out."


996
01:14:51.847 --> 01:14:55.010
At that time officer Trudel
who was at the rear window.


997
01:14:55.084 --> 01:14:57.575
Officer Trudel said,
"They're coming out."


998
01:15:00.456 --> 01:15:02.361
if you look carefully,
by the way, if you can


999
01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:04.290
take a look so I can point
to the monitor here,


1000
01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.228
right here is a line
of stakeout squad officers,


1001
01:15:08.297 --> 01:15:11.664
and they seem to be lined up at the
ready waiting for something to happen.


1002
01:15:11.734 --> 01:15:14.999
They seem to be waiting for something
to come out of that house.


1003
01:15:15.071 --> 01:15:17.835
You said that Rad
tried to take Tomaso out?


1004
01:15:17.907 --> 01:15:19.431
Mm-hmm.

1005
01:15:19.508 --> 01:15:24.377
He was on his knees, and he had
Tomaso around his stomach like that.


1006
01:15:24.447 --> 01:15:27.439
On his knees?
Was he crawling along the garage floor?


1007
01:15:27.516 --> 01:15:29.108
Rad was.

1008
01:15:41.931 --> 01:15:44.866
Now, when they did come out,
I see the smaller child come out,


1009
01:15:44.934 --> 01:15:46.799
and then an adult male
come out right behind them.


1010
01:15:46.869 --> 01:15:48.131
Yeah.

1011
01:15:48.204 --> 01:15:53.642
And he stood up and aimed a rifle up in the
direction of officer Bariana's position...


1012
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:56.576
and fired, like,
four or five quick shots.


1013
01:15:56.646 --> 01:15:58.944
Did Conrad
have a rifle or a gun...


1014
01:15:59.015 --> 01:16:02.507
when he went out the garage door?

1015
01:16:02.585 --> 01:16:03.882
Mm-mmm.

1016
01:16:03.953 --> 01:16:06.012
What did he use
to open the bolt on the door?


1017
01:16:06.088 --> 01:16:07.680
A big monkey wrench.

1018
01:16:07.757 --> 01:16:09.315
A big monkey wrench?

1019
01:16:09.392 --> 01:16:12.418
Are you certain it was a rifle and not a
monkey wrench or something of that nature?


1020
01:16:12.495 --> 01:16:15.931
No, sir. When this-
I know a rifle, believe me.


1021
01:16:15.998 --> 01:16:18.330
And when this male
pointed this rifle up,


1022
01:16:18.401 --> 01:16:23.065
I- in other words, I could hear sound
and see muzzle flashes.


1023
01:16:23.139 --> 01:16:27.075
Now, you say that some shooting started.
Did you hear shooting?


1024
01:16:27.143 --> 01:16:29.373
It was a-

1025
01:16:29.445 --> 01:16:31.345
Like it was just going after-

1026
01:16:31.414 --> 01:16:34.975
Like it was going-Bullets were
going after each other. Like-


1027
01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:37.144
Bullets were going
one right after the other.


1028
01:16:37.219 --> 01:16:39.244
- Something like that?
- Yeah.


1029
01:16:39.321 --> 01:16:42.119
Sergeant Griffiths, could you
just by rapping on the table...


1030
01:16:42.191 --> 01:16:46.059
indicate the sound the best
you can recall of those shots?


1031
01:16:46.128 --> 01:16:48.153
It was not automatic fire,
if that's what you're asking.


1032
01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:50.960
Okay, could you just try and indicate
for me what it sounded like?


1033
01:16:54.503 --> 01:16:57.939
Did you ever fire your weapons after the
bomb was dropped, officer Mulvihill?


1034
01:16:58.007 --> 01:16:59.497
No, sir.

1035
01:16:59.575 --> 01:17:02.601
- Officer D'Ulisse?
- No, sir.


1036
01:17:02.678 --> 01:17:06.580
He had two officers taking him out,
and then they started shooting again,


1037
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:11.211
and then they brought him back in,
and then they locked the thing back up.


1038
01:17:15.891 --> 01:17:18.223
Did you see the child
actually go back into the house?


1039
01:17:18.294 --> 01:17:20.319
I believe the child
went back into the house.


1040
01:17:20.396 --> 01:17:22.227
All right.

1041
01:17:27.136 --> 01:17:31.630
Do you have any idea why that person
may have gone back into the fire?


1042
01:17:31.707 --> 01:17:34.198
My own idea? What I think?

1043
01:17:34.276 --> 01:17:35.766
Yes.

1044
01:17:35.845 --> 01:17:40.077
I just think
they went back into that fire...


1045
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:42.049
sort of to regroup.

1046
01:17:42.718 --> 01:17:44.811
Well,

1047
01:17:44.887 --> 01:17:47.287
just as a human being myself...

1048
01:17:49.058 --> 01:17:52.721
I'm just trying to imagine myself
in that situation...


1049
01:17:52.795 --> 01:17:57.129
and behind me
there's a raging inferno...


1050
01:17:57.199 --> 01:18:01.568
and in front of me there are people
who are saying "come on out."


1051
01:18:02.505 --> 01:18:05.030
I'm trying to imagine...

1052
01:18:05.107 --> 01:18:08.770
what would cause me
to turn back and run into the fire.


1053
01:18:12.848 --> 01:18:16.511
I don't think we said anything
other than come down to us.


1054
01:18:16.585 --> 01:18:18.075
Come on down
with your hands up-


1055
01:18:18.154 --> 01:18:24.684
the normal police jargon
for calling the suspects to come down.


1056
01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.523
Mm-hmm.

1057
01:18:26.595 --> 01:18:29.758
I'm just saying that I'm trying to
put myself in that person's skin.


1058
01:18:29.832 --> 01:18:32.960
Sir, I don't think you ever could.
These were MOVE members.


1059
01:18:33.836 --> 01:18:37.670
Well, you see,

1060
01:18:38.641 --> 01:18:42.839
I knew a lot of those people...

1061
01:18:42.912 --> 01:18:45.472
as individuals
and as human beings.


1062
01:18:45.548 --> 01:18:48.745
A lot of people know MOVE
from what they may have seen.


1063
01:18:49.585 --> 01:18:51.712
But I had a
lot of dealings with them,

1064
01:18:51.787 --> 01:18:54.585
and I knew them to be more
than MOVE people.


1065
01:18:54.657 --> 01:18:59.253
I knew many of them by name,
as human beings.


1066
01:19:01.764 --> 01:19:03.425
It's probably
a rhetorical question.


1067
01:19:03.499 --> 01:19:05.233
I don't think you, from
the way you've


1068
01:19:05.246 --> 01:19:07.006
responded, I don't think
you can answer that.


1069
01:19:07.069 --> 01:19:08.559
No, sir.

1070
01:19:19.481 --> 01:19:21.711
And then
what happened to Tomaso?


1071
01:19:21.784 --> 01:19:25.447
Rhonda was going like this on his back.

1072
01:19:26.255 --> 01:19:28.815
- Rhonda had Tomaso?
- Mm-hmm.


1073
01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:32.486
And she was hitting him
on his back?


1074
01:19:32.561 --> 01:19:34.495
Was he crying then?

1075
01:19:35.598 --> 01:19:37.429
He had stopped crying?

1076
01:19:37.499 --> 01:19:39.467
Did you hear him cry anymore...

1077
01:19:39.535 --> 01:19:42.129
after she was trying to pat him
and hit him on his back?


1078
01:19:42.204 --> 01:19:43.933
Only one time.

1079
01:19:44.006 --> 01:19:46.133
- And then what happened?
- He stopped.


1080
01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:47.698
He stopped?

1081
01:19:53.849 --> 01:19:55.783
And then what happened?

1082
01:19:55.851 --> 01:20:00.015
I didn't hear nobody,
and I just ran out of there.


1083
01:20:06.128 --> 01:20:08.323
Oh, my goodness.

1084
01:20:09.565 --> 01:20:11.055
Well, Larry,

1085
01:20:11.133 --> 01:20:15.695
the flames are probably
now leaping, um,


1086
01:20:15.771 --> 01:20:18.171
uh, 10 stories high.

1087
01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.077
It just looked like something
was completely engulfed.


1088
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:21.937
What you're seeing now-

1089
01:20:22.011 --> 01:20:24.878
You're telling me that the flames
are now leaping high?


1090
01:20:38.928 --> 01:20:44.696
I remember Ramona coming from the rear of
the MOVE yard over the fence and down.


1091
01:20:44.767 --> 01:20:47.201
She had started
to walk down, stopped.


1092
01:20:47.269 --> 01:20:49.328
And she would wave
with her hand like this.


1093
01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.265
And then I see Birdie.

1094
01:20:53.342 --> 01:20:56.573
The way I describe it, it looked like
he literally came through the fire.


1095
01:20:57.846 --> 01:20:59.541
There was a board on fire there,

1096
01:20:59.615 --> 01:21:03.210
and he hopped over that
and he started coming down.


1097
01:21:03.285 --> 01:21:06.982
What did you see
when you first ran out of the house?


1098
01:21:07.056 --> 01:21:08.614
I saw fire and stuff.

1099
01:21:08.691 --> 01:21:10.659
You saw fire?
Where did you see the fire?


1100
01:21:10.726 --> 01:21:13.320
The tree was on fire,
and the house was.


1101
01:21:13.395 --> 01:21:15.414
And the house was on fire?
How about on the ground?


1102
01:21:15.427 --> 01:21:17.456
Was anything on the
ground on fire?


1103
01:21:17.533 --> 01:21:20.093
The pieces of the tree
was falling down.


1104
01:21:20.169 --> 01:21:23.104
Pieces of fire from the tree
were falling down?


1105
01:21:25.674 --> 01:21:29.735
Did the adults tell you what to do
if you all got out of the house?


1106
01:21:29.812 --> 01:21:32.372
They told us to stay together.

1107
01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:35.573
Ramona's up top.

1108
01:21:35.651 --> 01:21:37.585
- She's on the walkway, the elevated walkway?
- That's right.


1109
01:21:37.653 --> 01:21:39.382
Birdie's in the driveway.

1110
01:21:39.455 --> 01:21:42.856
Now, as they're coming down,
Ramona's a little bit in the front.


1111
01:21:42.925 --> 01:21:46.952
But at one time
does Ramona stop...


1112
01:21:47.029 --> 01:21:52.661
and she goes over to the railing and
reached over and tried to pick Birdie up.


1113
01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:55.465
He got I believe one foot,
maybe two, I don't know,


1114
01:21:55.537 --> 01:21:59.803
on the bottom of the concrete wall
where the fence meets.


1115
01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:01.035
Okay?

1116
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:03.305
And she either let go
or slipped or whatever.


1117
01:22:03.379 --> 01:22:05.404
But Birdie fell back.
He went back.


1118
01:22:05.481 --> 01:22:08.882
And I remember he didn't get a chance
to put his hands down to break his fall.


1119
01:22:08.951 --> 01:22:11.681
The impression I was left with-
He landed square on his head.


1120
01:22:14.923 --> 01:22:18.381
If you're watching somebody
or somebody falls...


1121
01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:20.826
and you hear a thud,

1122
01:22:20.896 --> 01:22:22.955
you can almost feel it.

1123
01:22:23.032 --> 01:22:25.557
That's the same sensation
I think we all got,


1124
01:22:25.634 --> 01:22:28.603
that we knew Birdie
was hurt at this time.


1125
01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:31.730
It was an actual feeling.
We could all feel it.


1126
01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:47.484
I remember Birdie just laying there,
not doing anything.


1127
01:22:47.556 --> 01:22:50.389
I said, "Tommy, here. Take my shotgun."
I said, "I'm gonna go get the kid."


1128
01:22:50.459 --> 01:22:53.019
And I remember him saying to me,
"I'll cover you."


1129
01:22:53.095 --> 01:22:55.723
- Officer Mellor saying that?
- That's right.


1130
01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:03.034
At one point
did I start out to get Birdie,


1131
01:23:03.105 --> 01:23:06.268
and that's the first time
I realized officer Tursi was behind me.


1132
01:23:06.341 --> 01:23:10.300
He grabbed my left shoulder. He said,"
Don't go out there, Jim. It's a trap."


1133
01:23:10.379 --> 01:23:12.006
What was your concern, officer?

1134
01:23:12.081 --> 01:23:14.379
I don't know how to explain it
other than a sixth sense or something...


1135
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:17.817
that there was something wrong
in the way Ramona went down.


1136
01:23:18.554 --> 01:23:22.115
I just felt something was incorrect
or not right about that situation.


1137
01:23:22.191 --> 01:23:26.423
I stopped him from going out
right at that time. That's all.


1138
01:23:26.495 --> 01:23:29.495
I was scared to death. I just didn't
wanna let that kid lay there like that.


1139
01:23:33.402 --> 01:23:34.960
So what did you do?

1140
01:23:35.037 --> 01:23:37.665
My priorities at that time were the kid.

1141
01:23:38.674 --> 01:23:41.575
We're trying to say to him,
"Son, come over here. Come over here."


1142
01:23:41.643 --> 01:23:43.668
We're trying to get
him to come to us.

1143
01:23:43.745 --> 01:23:46.373
This is the result
of officer Tursi saying be careful.


1144
01:23:46.448 --> 01:23:48.103
"It's not right" or
something to that effect.


1145
01:23:48.116 --> 01:23:49.781
"It doesn't feel right."

1146
01:23:49.852 --> 01:23:51.877
inadvertently, 
Birdie gets up.

1147
01:23:53.255 --> 01:23:56.156
I remember him taking a few steps
and went down in the water.


1148
01:23:56.225 --> 01:23:57.715
He fell?

1149
01:23:57.793 --> 01:23:59.732
I interpreted it as a fall
or stumble or whatever.


1150
01:23:59.745 --> 01:24:01.695
As soon as he went
down in the water,


1151
01:24:01.763 --> 01:24:04.789
at the same time that I seen that,
officer Tursi's right with me.


1152
01:24:04.867 --> 01:24:06.994
I said,
"Mike, I'm getting the kid,"


1153
01:24:07.069 --> 01:24:09.037
and he said,
"I got you covered."


1154
01:24:10.706 --> 01:24:12.731
I remember I went in
underneath with my right hand,


1155
01:24:12.808 --> 01:24:15.538
and I scooped him
underneath his left arm.


1156
01:24:15.611 --> 01:24:18.079
Was his head
submerged under the water?


1157
01:24:18.147 --> 01:24:20.547
I don't remember.
As soon as he hit the water, I went.


1158
01:24:39.334 --> 01:24:41.268
I remember as soon
as I scooped him up,


1159
01:24:41.336 --> 01:24:44.737
he said to me,
"Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me."


1160
01:24:55.918 --> 01:25:00.446
When the police got you
after you finally got out,


1161
01:25:00.522 --> 01:25:02.592
did they ask you anything
about whether or not


1162
01:25:02.605 --> 01:25:04.686
there were any kids
still in the house...


1163
01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.751
or were there any other
grown-ups still in the house?


1164
01:25:06.828 --> 01:25:08.159
Yeah.

1165
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:10.664
- You said there were other kids still there?
- Mm-hmm.


1166
01:25:10.732 --> 01:25:13.667
Do you remember who it was
who was still in the house?


1167
01:25:13.735 --> 01:25:15.999
Tree,

1168
01:25:16.071 --> 01:25:17.902
Netta,

1169
01:25:17.973 --> 01:25:19.565
Tomaso and Melissa,

1170
01:25:19.641 --> 01:25:21.336
Phil,

1171
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:24.902
and the big people
were Theresa, Rhonda,


1172
01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.948
Paul,

1173
01:25:27.015 --> 01:25:29.449
Nick...

1174
01:25:29.518 --> 01:25:31.486
and Rad and C.K.

1175
01:26:07.923 --> 01:26:12.587
Ramona Africa, the MOVE spokesperson in
recent weeks, is in police custody tonight.


1176
01:26:12.661 --> 01:26:14.925
She was captured
outside the MOVE compound...


1177
01:26:14.997 --> 01:26:18.489
sometime after the massive fire
broke out there this afternoon.


1178
01:26:18.567 --> 01:26:20.558
The child being treated
here at Children's...


1179
01:26:20.636 --> 01:26:23.764
is suffering from second-and
third-degree burns on his arms and legs.


1180
01:26:23.839 --> 01:26:27.159
All officials know at this point about his
identity is that his last name is Africa.


1181
01:26:28.143 --> 01:26:30.270
All night long,
an increasing number of firemen...


1182
01:26:30.345 --> 01:26:33.075
have been trying to battle
what is now a six-alarm blaze.


1183
01:26:33.148 --> 01:26:35.946
There's a lot more water
being trained on it,


1184
01:26:36.018 --> 01:26:39.215
but it looks as though this is going
to burn for a long, long time.


1185
01:27:05.047 --> 01:27:07.038
We had a difficult problem.

1186
01:27:08.083 --> 01:27:09.983
We made a difficult decision.

1187
01:27:10.886 --> 01:27:14.822
It did not turn out as we intended.

1188
01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:17.882
As we face the coming days,

1189
01:27:17.959 --> 01:27:21.360
I ask your prayers for our city,

1190
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:24.399
for the homeless families...

1191
01:27:24.466 --> 01:27:29.096
and for the families
of those who've lost lives.


1192
01:27:53.895 --> 01:27:56.659
In the beginning, 
MOVE people...

1193
01:27:56.732 --> 01:28:01.362
were the most happiest bunch
of people you could ever know.


1194
01:28:01.436 --> 01:28:07.238
We were a family, peaceful, loving.

1195
01:28:07.309 --> 01:28:09.800
And in the beginning,

1196
01:28:09.878 --> 01:28:12.676
MOVE was harassed a great deal.

1197
01:28:14.216 --> 01:28:18.812
We were beat many, many times.

1198
01:28:19.921 --> 01:28:25.154
We were jailed
many, many times.


1199
01:28:26.461 --> 01:28:29.794
And I'm talking about a people...

1200
01:28:29.865 --> 01:28:33.460
who had feelings,

1201
01:28:33.535 --> 01:28:35.969
who are no different than you or I.

1202
01:28:53.822 --> 01:28:57.280
If the system can convict me
of riot and conspiracy...


1203
01:28:57.359 --> 01:28:59.589
in a blatant situation like that...

1204
01:28:59.661 --> 01:29:04.826
where it's obvious to everybody,
the whole world, that I did not riot,


1205
01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:08.358
then it should not be hard
to imagine at all...


1206
01:29:08.437 --> 01:29:13.966
why and how this system convicted
nine people of murdering one cop.


1207
01:29:14.042 --> 01:29:15.839
It's the same thing,

1208
01:29:15.911 --> 01:29:19.642
that the system had one intention
in both confrontations,


1209
01:29:19.714 --> 01:29:24.811
to either kill MOVE people
or to put us in prison as long as possible.


1210
01:29:24.886 --> 01:29:26.717
It's just that simple.

1211
01:29:37.365 --> 01:29:39.230
Was it like being in a war?

1212
01:29:40.368 --> 01:29:44.270
There's just too many things are going on,
to sit here and just say how you felt.


1213
01:29:44.339 --> 01:29:46.011
We felt-l thought about
the kids in the house.


1214
01:29:46.024 --> 01:29:47.706
I thought about my kids.

1215
01:29:47.776 --> 01:29:51.872
I thought about a lot of things.
But to sit here-l don't know.


1216
01:29:51.947 --> 01:29:53.938
- I couldn't answer that.
- Mm-hmm.


1217
01:29:56.751 --> 01:29:58.241
I am, uh-

1218
01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.019
I've, uh, been sitting here
listening for many days...


1219
01:30:04.526 --> 01:30:10.954
and I've read scores of pages
of reports and testimony.


1220
01:30:11.032 --> 01:30:14.866
And it has all been. All of it.

1221
01:30:14.936 --> 01:30:17.461
Uh, very depressing...

1222
01:30:17.539 --> 01:30:19.803
and very discouraging...

1223
01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:23.003
except what I've read
about officer Berghaier...


1224
01:30:23.078 --> 01:30:26.070
and what I've heard
from officer Berghaier.


1225
01:30:26.147 --> 01:30:30.948
And if there's any hope
in this whole sorry situation,


1226
01:30:31.019 --> 01:30:32.753
it's because of that officer,
and I wanna thank him.


1227
01:30:32.766 --> 01:30:34.511
Thank you, sir.

1228
01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.880
I think you've done
such a good job.


1229
01:31:00.949 --> 01:31:02.940
I'm gonna stop
my questions now,


1230
01:31:03.018 --> 01:31:07.079
and I wanna thank you for taking all this
time to come in here and chat with us.


1231
01:31:07.155 --> 01:31:09.385
That will bring a smile
to your face, won't it?


1232
01:31:09.457 --> 01:31:11.448
And I wanna thank
your dad, Mr. Ward.


1233
01:31:11.526 --> 01:31:13.721
- Thank you very much for your cooperation.
- You're quite welcome.


1234
01:31:13.795 --> 01:31:15.763
- And Mr. Shrager, of course.
- Thank you.


1235
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:20.767
This will conclude
this deposition of testimony...


1236
01:31:20.835 --> 01:31:23.929
of Michael, uh, Ward.

1237
01:31:48.263 --> 01:31:50.254
As of today,

1238
01:31:50.332 --> 01:31:53.927
you the people,
have all the principal facts...


1239
01:31:54.836 --> 01:31:57.771
which tell the story
of the Osage Avenue tragedy.


1240
01:31:59.007 --> 01:32:03.000
Rarely has any community
ever subjected itself...


1241
01:32:03.078 --> 01:32:05.876
to a public self-appraisal...

1242
01:32:05.947 --> 01:32:10.213
as painful and necessary
as this has been.


1243
01:32:11.019 --> 01:32:14.682
But we believe that this process
is absolutely necessary...


1244
01:32:14.756 --> 01:32:19.022
to prevent such a terrible thing
from ever happening again.


1245
01:32:20.395 --> 01:32:24.195
And now I declare
these public hearings...


1246
01:32:24.265 --> 01:32:27.393
to be in recess until further notice.
