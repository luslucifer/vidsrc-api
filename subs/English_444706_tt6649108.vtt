00:00:06.988 --> 00:00:08.956
<i>He's in the trance.</i>

2
00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:11.125
<i>He isn't thinking of jokes, though.</i>

3
00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:14.595
<i>He's composing the voiceover
I'm saying to you right now.</i>


4
00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:19.333
<i>Getting me to agree to this
was beyond his wildest dreams.</i>


5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.804
<i>And he doesn't want to waste
the opportunity on the frivolous.</i>


6
00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.009
<i>You have reached the voicemail
of comedic genius Dave Chappelle.</i>


7
00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:31.379
<i>Unfortunately,
he can't or won't speak right now,</i>


8
00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.815
<i>so please leave a detailed message.</i>

9
00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:43.317
Yeah.

10
00:01:45.053 --> 00:01:46.120
Thank you.

11
00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:49.690
Thank you very much.

12
00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:58.299
Thank you.

13
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:01.536
What's going on?

14
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.873
Good to see everybody out here tonight.

15
00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:09.343
Thank you.

16
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.550
Hey, have a seat.
Everybody be comfortable and relax.


17
00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:19.087
Oh, my gosh.
Good to be back in Austin, Texas.


18
00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:23.458
It's good to know
that plaid is back in.

19
00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:26.661
Most of the dudes I meet
around these parts


20
00:02:26.728 --> 00:02:28.963
are dressed like a dyke in New York,
so I'm glad to see that.


21
00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:38.873
Man! Fucking Texas. 
This place is...

22
00:02:39.674 --> 00:02:40.875
It's pretty good.

23
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.711
Pretty damn good.

24
00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:46.247
I was in Santa Fe the other night,

25
00:02:46.314 --> 00:02:48.716
and a motherfucker threw a banana peel
at me.


26
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:52.420
Yeah, that didn't feel so good.

27
00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:55.156
Of course, it was a white person.

28
00:02:57.492 --> 00:03:01.429
Not to indict the whites. I'm just saying.
Not to profile.


29
00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:06.334
And then, not only did he throw
a banana peel at me, but...


30
00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:09.203
it was premeditated. 
You could tell.

31
00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:14.342
You could tell. The peel was too brown.
You know what I mean?


32
00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.611
You didn't eat that banana recently,
motherfucker.


33
00:03:16.677 --> 00:03:18.379
You had that shit waiting on me.

34
00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:24.452
And the whole crowd was white,
so it just got instantly creepy,


35
00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.488
and everyone looked like they were
looking at <i>12 Years a Slave.</i>


36
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:28.823
They were all just like...

37
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:34.662
Who the fuck does that?

38
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.132
And then they arrested the guy,
which was...


39
00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:42.970
I said, "Someone's gonna fuck you
in the butt in the holding cell.


40
00:03:43.037 --> 00:03:44.205
You know that, right?

41
00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:46.541
You can't just be throwing banana peels
at Dave Chappelle.


42
00:03:46.607 --> 00:03:48.810
They're not gonna let you get away
with this."


43
00:03:55.717 --> 00:03:58.152
And the press called me up like,
"Do you have a statement?"


44
00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.156
"A statement?!
For a fucking banana peel? No!


45
00:04:02.223 --> 00:04:04.125
I don't have anything to say."

46
00:04:06.928 --> 00:04:11.032
This guy was fucking famous
for throwing a banana peel at me.


47
00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:14.836
Twenty years from now,
he'll be tucking his kids into bed,


48
00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:16.971
and the kids will be like,
"Daddy, tell me about the day


49
00:04:17.038 --> 00:04:20.775
you threw that banana peel at that nigger
in Santa Fe."


50
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.113
"Boy, I tell you what.
That black motherfucker had it coming.


51
00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:30.118
I saw his name up on the marquee
about a week before.


52
00:04:30.184 --> 00:04:32.920
I said, 'Man, if I could just get
close enough to meet him...


53
00:04:34.122 --> 00:04:36.691
I'd throw a banana on that nigger
and show him how... '"


54
00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:43.097
Fucking Bananagate. 
I didn't even like...

55
00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:49.037
I didn't even want to press charges.
This has happened to me before.


56
00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:54.008
No, seriously. Not a banana.
I live in Ohio, right?


57
00:04:54.075 --> 00:04:56.110
So, this was a few winters ago.

58
00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:57.779
Oh, I didn't know
you would ever clap for that.


59
00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:01.382
Well, all right. That's the first time
that shit's ever happened.


60
00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.884
"Ohio?!"

61
00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:07.755
Anyway...

62
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.758
I live amongst the whites.

63
00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.230
Small town in Ohio.

64
00:05:17.065 --> 00:05:19.434
And it was wintertime,
and it had snowed recently,


65
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.537
so there's huge snowdrifts on the street.
I was walking with my sister.


66
00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:25.373
Now, my sister was dressed
in all Muslim garb,


67
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.674
as were her children,

68
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:28.609
and I was dressed as Dave Chappelle.

69
00:05:28.676 --> 00:05:31.946
And we were walking
and just talking about something,


70
00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:35.883
and a car sped around the corner,
and the window came down,


71
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.820
and somebody threw a snowball
and hit me right in my shoulder.


72
00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:43.391
I didn't know what was going on.
Why was this happening?


73
00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:47.061
Because I'm black? Because she's Muslim?
Because I'm Dave Chappelle?


74
00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:52.166
I couldn't tell.
But, again, I knew it was premeditated.


75
00:05:53.234 --> 00:05:56.137
Because who the fuck has a snowball
in a warm car?


76
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:01.743
But he didn't think it
all the way through, lady.


77
00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:04.278
Because he went around the corner
and got stopped at a red light.


78
00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:05.713
He was caught in the traffic.

79
00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:09.851
So, I ran out into the street,
and I just tapped on his window.


80
00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:12.887
"My man, could I just talk to you guys
for a second?


81
00:06:12.954 --> 00:06:14.589
Come on out for one second.
I just want to talk to you."


82
00:06:14.655 --> 00:06:17.291
There's four young white dudes in the car.
They're like, "Just chill, bro."


83
00:06:17.358 --> 00:06:20.428
I said, "Relax. 
I just want to talk."

84
00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:22.730
Now, this is an old black trick.

85
00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:26.467
Really, I didn't want to talk.
I was gonna fuck 'em up.


86
00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.073
So, if you're ever caught in traffic,

87
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.342
and a black guy starts saying
he just wants to talk to you,


88
00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:35.543
don't open the door.

89
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.712
Even if he's me, smiling at you.

90
00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:43.551
And they were like,
"Chill, bro. Just chill."


91
00:06:43.618 --> 00:06:45.486
And the one guy in the back seat...

92
00:06:45.553 --> 00:06:47.355
I don't know what,
he was just cockier than his friends.


93
00:06:47.422 --> 00:06:50.858
He was like, "Fuck it, man!
I'll get out the car!"


94
00:06:50.925 --> 00:06:52.260
And I started yanking on his door.

95
00:06:52.326 --> 00:06:54.662
"Let me help you, motherfucker.
Let me just help you out."


96
00:06:56.597 --> 00:06:58.700
And I didn't notice his window was down.

97
00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:02.136
And he threw a snowball,
that shit hit me right in my chest. Pow!


98
00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:04.539
He said, "Fuck you, you fucking nigger!"

99
00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:07.442
And then the light turned green
and they sped off.


100
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:10.044
And I smiled from ear to ear.

101
00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:13.781
I looked at my sister,
and she said, "I got the plates."


102
00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:18.686
And I was happy as shit because
throwing a snowball at a motherfucker


103
00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:20.521
is a misdemeanor assault.

104
00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:22.990
But if you call him a nigger
when you do it,


105
00:07:23.057 --> 00:07:24.459
that's a felony hate crime.

106
00:07:27.462 --> 00:07:29.163
And me and my sister start dancing.

107
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.866
"We're gonna send this motherfucker
to jail!"


108
00:07:34.635 --> 00:07:36.971
I didn't notice it,
but while I was yelling at him,


109
00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:40.641
a crowd of all-white people had formed,
'cause it was an all-white town.


110
00:07:40.708 --> 00:07:43.177
And I was like, "Uh-oh."
I thought I was gonna get jumped.


111
00:07:43.244 --> 00:07:47.548
Then one of them white guys stepped up
and was like, "I didn't like that at all.


112
00:07:50.618 --> 00:07:52.253
This is not what this town represents.

113
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.822
I don't want this goddamn stuff
in my vicinity."


114
00:07:56.157 --> 00:07:59.360
And another white guy was like,
"Yeah! I didn't like it, either!"


115
00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.430
And then an old white guy stepped out
of the crowd and said,


116
00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:04.499
"Young man, if you're going to fill out
a police report,


117
00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:07.335
I would like to come with you
and do the same."


118
00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:09.137
I said, "You guys
would do that for me?"

119
00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:12.140
And the whole crowd said, "Hooray!"
I said, "Come on, y'all!"


120
00:08:12.206 --> 00:08:14.342
I looked like Malcolm X
going to see Brother Johnson


121
00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:15.410
with a trail of white people.

122
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.254
Unreal. An hour later,
we were all sitting in the police station,


123
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.690
and the police came in.
They were like, "Well, Mr. Chappelle...


124
00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:31.526
sixteen identical police reports.

125
00:08:32.994 --> 00:08:36.531
We ran the tags. Two young men
that had their mother's car.


126
00:08:37.498 --> 00:08:40.468
We have all four suspects in holding,
and the mother is here.


127
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:43.771
It's up to you. 
Whatever you want to do.

128
00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:45.940
If you want to press charges,
we'll move forward.


129
00:08:46.007 --> 00:08:47.442
Mr. Chappelle, are you okay?"

130
00:08:47.508 --> 00:08:48.810
"Huh?

131
00:08:50.178 --> 00:08:51.913
Sorry about that, Officer.
I'm a little flustered.


132
00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:53.848
I've never been in a position

133
00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:56.784
where I could decide the fate
of white children before.


134
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:57.852
But...

135
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.090
it's weighing heavy on me, sir.

136
00:09:03.791 --> 00:09:05.293
And I really can't decide."

137
00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:09.831
And I saw a lady pacing back and forth
in the hallway,


138
00:09:09.897 --> 00:09:12.567
and I said, "Is that..."
He goes, "Yes, that's their mother."


139
00:09:13.568 --> 00:09:15.370
"Can I speak to her
before I make a decision?"


140
00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:19.407
And when the mom came in
and she saw it was me,


141
00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:21.042
she busted out crying.

142
00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:23.478
"Oh, God. Oh, no.
I don't want him to go to jail.


143
00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:25.747
I am so sorry.
I didn't raise him to do this.


144
00:09:25.813 --> 00:09:27.582
We love your comedy.
We love you at the house."


145
00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:30.551
I said, "Miss, please, just...
All right, look.


146
00:09:30.618 --> 00:09:33.554
I don't necessarily want your son
to go to jail, either.


147
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.092
But what he did was pretty fucked up.

148
00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:41.562
So, is there something we can do,
short of jail,


149
00:09:41.629 --> 00:09:43.531
just to let him know that he's wrong?"

150
00:09:43.598 --> 00:09:46.067
She said, "I don't know.
What did you have in mind?"


151
00:09:46.134 --> 00:09:48.302
"Miss, I've never been
in this position before.


152
00:09:50.905 --> 00:09:55.309
Oh, you know what we could do?
I don't know if I'm asking too much.


153
00:09:55.376 --> 00:09:58.312
But maybe if you...
if you could just...


154
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.983
suck my dick a little bit.
Just a little bit.


155
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.518
I'm not gonna finish.

156
00:10:03.584 --> 00:10:06.754
I just want you to do it enough
so that I can tell him you did it."


157
00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:12.260
I'm kidding.

158
00:10:13.361 --> 00:10:16.497
I'm kidding.
I wouldn't do that to anybody's mother.


159
00:10:17.098 --> 00:10:19.333
Maybe my kid's mom, but that's it.

160
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.607
Ebola was in Texas. 
Ebola made a visit.

161
00:10:29.677 --> 00:10:33.981
Killed that man in Dallas.
Five days, that man melted to death.


162
00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:37.518
What happened to the brother in Dallas?

163
00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:40.521
"Where was the secret serum?"
is what we all said.


164
00:10:41.289 --> 00:10:43.391
I remember in the beginning of Ebola,

165
00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:47.362
there were two American doctors
that got sick in Africa.


166
00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:50.865
They flew them in a private jet straight
to Atlanta, to the CDC.


167
00:10:50.932 --> 00:10:53.801
I didn't even know CDC saw patients.

168
00:10:57.138 --> 00:10:59.307
There it was said they administered

169
00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:02.643
what <i>The New York Times</i>called
"a secret serum."


170
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.180
I don't know what's in it.
It's just like Colonel Sanders' recipe.


171
00:11:07.315 --> 00:11:09.917
But both of these motherfuckers survived.

172
00:11:09.984 --> 00:11:11.819
These doctors, thank God, are healthy.

173
00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:14.355
They are out there somewhere tonight
at Whole Foods,


174
00:11:14.422 --> 00:11:16.824
touching vegetables, walking around.

175
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:18.359
Everything's okay.

176
00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:21.262
"Hey, Frank. How are you?"

177
00:11:21.329 --> 00:11:25.066
"You didn't hear? I had Ebola last week.
But I'm doing all right now.


178
00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:28.002
I was bleeding out of my eyes and anus,
so I got concerned,


179
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:29.404
but I'm okay."

180
00:11:32.607 --> 00:11:34.575
What happened to the brother in Dallas?

181
00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:36.877
They just rubbed some Vicks
on that nigga's chest.


182
00:11:36.944 --> 00:11:37.945
"Good luck, little buddy."

183
00:11:47.722 --> 00:11:49.290
I knew he wasn't gonna make it.

184
00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:53.594
I remember. Sad.

185
00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:56.030
I saw in <i>The New York Times...</i>

186
00:11:56.931 --> 00:12:00.134
they said Ebola is the new AIDS.

187
00:12:00.201 --> 00:12:02.336
Whew! Isn't that something?

188
00:12:02.403 --> 00:12:05.106
Here I am, thinking that old AIDS
was working just fine,


189
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.109
and they already have a new AIDS out.

190
00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:09.777
Isn't that amazing how they do that?

191
00:12:09.844 --> 00:12:13.247
Isn't it weird how there's a disease
that just starts in 1980,


192
00:12:13.314 --> 00:12:16.217
and it doesn't kill anybody
but niggas, fags and junkies?


193
00:12:16.284 --> 00:12:19.153
Isn't that a fucking amazing coincidence

194
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.757
that this disease hates everybody
that old, white people hate?


195
00:12:29.464 --> 00:12:30.932
I think either God is white,

196
00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:33.801
or the government hid that shit
in disco balls.


197
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.438
Only fun people get AIDS.

198
00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:43.044
Last month,
on the front of <i>The New York Times,</i>


199
00:12:43.111 --> 00:12:45.012
the measles was the headline.

200
00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:48.116
I had to check the date of the paper.
I was like, "Measles? Is this 1850?


201
00:12:48.182 --> 00:12:52.220
What the fuck is this?
Why is measles in the news?"


202
00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:57.158
It turns out they were trying to decide
if mandatory vaccinations for children


203
00:12:57.225 --> 00:12:58.626
is the way we all want to go.

204
00:12:58.693 --> 00:12:59.827
Any thoughts?

205
00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:06.167
You say yes?
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen. I just...


206
00:13:08.136 --> 00:13:10.705
I don't know. I
don't know about this one.

207
00:13:10.772 --> 00:13:14.675
First of all, black people generally
don't trust doctors.


208
00:13:15.743 --> 00:13:18.546
After the Tuskegee experiments
and all that shit.


209
00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:21.883
More importantly, don't forget
Michael Jackson was killed by a doctor.


210
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.087
Granted, he was doing drugs.
But if I was a heroin addict


211
00:13:26.154 --> 00:13:29.023
and I had a licensed physician
injecting heroin in me,


212
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.324
I should survive that.

213
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.529
I'd just be like, "I'm good, right?
I'm good?


214
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.764
It's not too much, is it?"

215
00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:40.902
Dr. Butterfingers killed Michael Jackson.

216
00:13:40.968 --> 00:13:43.371
After that, I was like,
"Fuck going to the doctor."


217
00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:47.008
Why the fuck am I getting
my kids vaccinated


218
00:13:47.075 --> 00:13:48.810
for an old-ass disease like measles?

219
00:13:48.876 --> 00:13:52.046
You might as well give them
a diarrhea shot if you're so worried.


220
00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:56.184
Diarrhea has a bigger body count
than the measles do.


221
00:13:58.286 --> 00:14:00.655
You know, diarrhea is funny today, but...

222
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.425
a hundred years ago,
if your ass had diarrhea,


223
00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:07.929
you were a goner.
There was a zero chance of surviving.


224
00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:10.198
You get that first squirt. Pfft! Uh-oh.

225
00:14:11.766 --> 00:14:13.701
"Better start getting my affairs in order.

226
00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:17.739
I don't have much time.
It's diarrhea. It's very serious."


227
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.743
You just watch your buddy slowly die
in a pool of his own shit.


228
00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:23.945
Pfft! "Oh. Oh.

229
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:25.146
I give up, diarrhea."

230
00:14:25.213 --> 00:14:27.582
Pfffft! "You're too strong." Pfft!

231
00:14:31.085 --> 00:14:32.954
Nowadays, your buddy would be like,
"You got diarrhea?


232
00:14:33.021 --> 00:14:35.523
Just eat a banana, nigga.
Drink some water. Let's get to the club.


233
00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:37.759
We can still make last call."

234
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.598
Tough time for the blacks.

235
00:14:48.636 --> 00:14:51.973
These are not good times for the blacks.
You know what I'm talking about, right?


236
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.375
Police are killing us again.

237
00:14:57.011 --> 00:14:59.247
It's a very unfortunate
set of circumstances,


238
00:14:59.313 --> 00:15:00.848
because we were doing very well.

239
00:15:01.783 --> 00:15:06.054
You know, America has a racial hot seat.
I think we can all agree that's the truth.


240
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.557
And we can also agree that that hot seat
is traditionally occupied


241
00:15:09.624 --> 00:15:13.928
by African-Americans in general,
African-American men in particular.


242
00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:17.565
Although, I can see that, in recent years,

243
00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:21.002
that seat has been occupied by Mexicans...

244
00:15:22.103 --> 00:15:23.805
and I daresay Arabs.

245
00:15:25.473 --> 00:15:27.075
And we, the black Americans,

246
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:29.544
would like to thank you both
for your sacrifice


247
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.912
and your struggle.

248
00:15:33.781 --> 00:15:35.083
We needed a break.

249
00:15:36.584 --> 00:15:38.486
We needed a goddamn break.

250
00:15:41.088 --> 00:15:42.356
We all go through something,

251
00:15:42.422 --> 00:15:44.858
but at least I can leave
my backpack someplace.


252
00:15:47.694 --> 00:15:51.298
If you're Arab and forget a backpack,
you got about 20 minutes


253
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.669
before they send that robot
to blow your shit up.


254
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.973
You can kiss all that Engineering homework
good-bye, Fouhad.


255
00:16:03.144 --> 00:16:06.114
Now ISIS is number one
on the terrorist charts.


256
00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:10.451
And ISIS is fucking scary.

257
00:16:10.518 --> 00:16:14.222
'Cause if ISIS catches you,
they're going to cut your head off.


258
00:16:14.288 --> 00:16:17.592
That's what they do.
I've seen them do it on YouTube.


259
00:16:18.526 --> 00:16:20.595
It was fucking awful.
He looked right into the camera and said,


260
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:23.765
"Obama, I am back."

261
00:16:25.099 --> 00:16:27.568
I saw that shit, 
I said, "Oh, my God.

262
00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:29.303
Don't like."

263
00:16:34.642 --> 00:16:37.445
How is this guy cutting people's heads off
on YouTube?


264
00:16:37.512 --> 00:16:39.080
I can't even post a dick pic,

265
00:16:39.147 --> 00:16:41.949
and this motherfucker
is decapitating people.


266
00:16:44.085 --> 00:16:46.020
I'm gonna have to change my settings.

267
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.994
You know, everyone has it hard.
But I think, harder than black people


268
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:56.564
and harder than Arabs and Mexicans,
you know who has it the worst?


269
00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:57.999
Fat black people.

270
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.743
It's hard for white people to understand,
but what I'm saying is very true.


271
00:17:09.877 --> 00:17:11.779
Fat black people have a really rough road,

272
00:17:11.846 --> 00:17:13.848
because all manner
of things kill white people.


273
00:17:13.915 --> 00:17:15.983
But you know what kills more black people
than anything,


274
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.485
more than police and terrorism?

275
00:17:17.552 --> 00:17:21.055
Salt, nigga. Regular-ass table salt.

276
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.826
Here, white people
are getting Ebola cures and shit,


277
00:17:24.892 --> 00:17:27.495
and meanwhile,
I'm dying from fucking flavoring.


278
00:17:33.534 --> 00:17:36.738
Look, honestly,
I'll stop talking about it.


279
00:17:36.804 --> 00:17:39.474
Let me say this, though.
Let me just say this.


280
00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.343
Can we all just say
that we've seen it coming?


281
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.411
Were you surprised?

282
00:17:43.478 --> 00:17:45.346
It's like when that guy threw
that banana at me.


283
00:17:45.413 --> 00:17:48.449
Do you think I was surprised? Hell no.

284
00:17:49.183 --> 00:17:52.920
I've been in show business 30 years.
I was expecting this banana.


285
00:17:54.022 --> 00:17:55.123
I knew one of these nights...

286
00:17:55.189 --> 00:17:57.825
I was like, "Somebody's gonna throw
a banana at me one of these nights."


287
00:18:01.562 --> 00:18:03.965
'Cause that's how it starts,
with the name-calling.


288
00:18:04.766 --> 00:18:08.069
Like that Paula Deen. Remember Paula Deen
got fired from the Food Network?


289
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.371
If you know anything about show business,

290
00:18:10.438 --> 00:18:14.175
it is really hard to get fired
from the fucking Food Network.


291
00:18:15.576 --> 00:18:17.779
And they dropped that bitch
like a hot potato.


292
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.851
All because she called somebody an N-word

293
00:18:23.918 --> 00:18:25.553
I don't know who she said it to,

294
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.522
but whoever it was
was just looking at her like,


295
00:18:27.588 --> 00:18:29.290
"I'm gonna get you for this, bitch."

296
00:18:31.726 --> 00:18:34.896
That shit came back 30 years later
like a Bill Cosby rape


297
00:18:34.962 --> 00:18:36.664
and sunk her battleship.

298
00:18:41.436 --> 00:18:45.006
And every black person was mad,
but we weren't <i>that</i>mad.


299
00:18:45.073 --> 00:18:48.076
It was more confusing
than it was infuriating.


300
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.913
I was just like, "Well, how is this bitch
gonna call me a nigger


301
00:18:51.979 --> 00:18:55.450
when she taught me how to fry chicken?
That's not fair."


302
00:19:03.491 --> 00:19:06.661
I think Donald Sterling's shit
was more serious.


303
00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:09.163
Remember Donald Sterling?
He used to own the Clippers,


304
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.900
and then he got caught
on a secretly recorded tape


305
00:19:12.967 --> 00:19:17.605
saying some very unsavory things
about African-Americans.


306
00:19:18.439 --> 00:19:20.441
And there's a lesson in that
for all of us.


307
00:19:21.676 --> 00:19:26.581
The lesson is if you are old
and white and racist


308
00:19:26.647 --> 00:19:28.316
in this great country,

309
00:19:28.383 --> 00:19:30.018
whatever you do...

310
00:19:31.352 --> 00:19:35.390
don't tell your black girlfriend
about that shit. Because...


311
00:19:38.159 --> 00:19:39.660
that's who made the tape.

312
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.229
She recorded all that shit.
And the tape was terrible.


313
00:19:42.295 --> 00:19:46.766
He was like, "Stop bringing black guys
to my games."


314
00:19:47.268 --> 00:19:48.436
At first, we were all confused.

315
00:19:48.503 --> 00:19:50.905
"How the fuck are you gonna have a game
without us?"


316
00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:58.312
But it turned out that the black guy
he was speaking of


317
00:19:58.379 --> 00:20:03.184
was none other than Magic Johnson,
the billionaire!


318
00:20:03.251 --> 00:20:04.919
Unbelievable.

319
00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:08.589
Never even mentioned the fact
that he had AIDS,


320
00:20:08.656 --> 00:20:11.359
which is the first thing I would've said
to my girlfriend.


321
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:18.266
This guy must be really racist
if AIDS is the footnote.


322
00:20:19.734 --> 00:20:22.737
"You gotta be careful, baby.
He got the old Ebola."


323
00:20:34.449 --> 00:20:37.452
You can say what you want about that girl,
but I'm gonna tell you right now


324
00:20:37.518 --> 00:20:40.455
she is a goddamn hero.

325
00:20:41.756 --> 00:20:44.092
You might've thought
these things were happening before,


326
00:20:44.158 --> 00:20:47.328
but now you can see it all in front of you
without a shadow of a doubt.


327
00:20:47.395 --> 00:20:49.364
That shit actually went down.

328
00:20:50.331 --> 00:20:52.166
She sucked that old guy's dick.

329
00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:57.138
She really took one for the team
on that one.


330
00:20:58.039 --> 00:21:00.942
That's really gross.
His dick is, like, 80 years old.


331
00:21:01.609 --> 00:21:03.277
It's like tasting history.

332
00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:07.982
Like, five wars on it,
the Civil Rights Movement,


333
00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:09.450
the Great Depression.

334
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:14.288
This guy's been fucking from 40 years
before Bill Cosby's first rape.


335
00:21:14.355 --> 00:21:15.523
It's a very old man.

336
00:21:16.424 --> 00:21:17.892
A very old penis.

337
00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:25.233
But all that shit
is still just name-calling.


338
00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:28.269
Like, name-calling does not break
the modern black man.


339
00:21:28.336 --> 00:21:30.838
That's not gonna do the trick.
I don't give a fuck about that.


340
00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:34.108
If I went to Kentucky Fried Chicken,
and for some reason,


341
00:21:34.175 --> 00:21:39.647
everyone behind the counter had
a Ku Klux Klan hood on top of their head,


342
00:21:39.714 --> 00:21:41.282
what do you think I'm gonna do
in this day and age?


343
00:21:41.349 --> 00:21:44.252
Run out of Kentucky Fried Chicken?
Not if I'm hungry.


344
00:21:46.454 --> 00:21:49.624
I'll go straight to the front.
"Hey, man. Let me get a two-piece."


345
00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:51.993
I don't give a fuck what he says.

346
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.429
"You want a biscuit with that, nigger?"

347
00:21:56.097 --> 00:21:58.599
"I thought it came with a biscuit.
What's all this attitude?


348
00:22:02.103 --> 00:22:05.006
I want a two-piece. Chop, chop.
You know what it is."


349
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:08.776
But I'm not gonna be mad.
Why would I be mad?


350
00:22:09.377 --> 00:22:12.447
He's the one that's gotta work
at Kentucky Fried Chicken, not me.


351
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:24.726
How about this? What if I lived in Austin
and I had a white girlfriend?


352
00:22:24.792 --> 00:22:25.927
It's possible in Austin.

353
00:22:25.993 --> 00:22:28.730
As a matter of fact,
some people say it's necessary.


354
00:22:28.796 --> 00:22:30.365
But that's not the point.

355
00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.069
And me and my white girlfriend are
at home one night,


356
00:22:35.136 --> 00:22:36.738
and we're just doing what lovers do.

357
00:22:36.804 --> 00:22:39.707
Maybe she's butt-naked
and she's down on one knee,


358
00:22:39.774 --> 00:22:41.976
giving me a hand-job.
I love a good hand-job.


359
00:22:42.043 --> 00:22:43.911
And she's really jerking me off.

360
00:22:43.978 --> 00:22:46.414
You know,
getting her obliques nice and tight.


361
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:48.282
I got a huge dick, so she's like...

362
00:22:51.352 --> 00:22:54.555
And I'm like, "Wow,
this really feels wonderful.


363
00:22:54.622 --> 00:22:57.025
I think I'm gonna come."

364
00:22:57.091 --> 00:22:59.961
And then she looks up at me and goes,
"Come in my face...


365
00:23:00.628 --> 00:23:01.729
nigger."

366
00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:05.266
I know, that's a tough one.

367
00:23:07.235 --> 00:23:09.537
Well, what do you think I'm gonna do?
"Hey!"


368
00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:17.879
That's no time for integrity,
ladies and gentlemen.


369
00:23:17.945 --> 00:23:20.348
I'm busting that nut in her face.

370
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.851
I'll sort through the ethics later.

371
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.256
But I'm what they call
a man of his word.

372
00:23:28.322 --> 00:23:30.191
If I say I'm coming, I'm coming.

373
00:23:31.592 --> 00:23:33.828
I don't give a fuck what happens.
God forbid, somebody could shoot me.


374
00:23:33.895 --> 00:23:35.463
If I say I'm coming, there's still that...

375
00:23:42.336 --> 00:23:44.439
It doesn't mean I like getting shot.

376
00:23:53.715 --> 00:23:57.418
Oh, boy.
Yeah, a tough time for the blacks.


377
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.722
I'm not gonna say nothing
about the police.


378
00:24:00.788 --> 00:24:02.623
I'll leave that for Chris Rock.

379
00:24:07.528 --> 00:24:11.032
The other big sports story
was, fucking, Ray Rice's tape.


380
00:24:11.099 --> 00:24:13.301
Anyone see that Ray Rice tape?

381
00:24:17.605 --> 00:24:19.941
I can't stop watching it.

382
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.311
It's fucking awful.

383
00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:26.114
It's the most violent thing
I've seen happen to a woman


384
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.815
that was shot in color.

385
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.020
Really fucking bad.
If I could've froze time at that moment


386
00:24:32.086 --> 00:24:33.821
and gave Ray Rice some advice,

387
00:24:33.888 --> 00:24:36.391
I don't think there's any way possible
I'd be like...


388
00:24:37.091 --> 00:24:38.760
"You should punch her in the face."

389
00:24:40.561 --> 00:24:42.163
That's a fucking terrible idea.

390
00:24:43.564 --> 00:24:46.501
At the same time, I also believe
she shouldn't have rushed him.


391
00:24:47.835 --> 00:24:49.804
What the fuck? 
You can't beat him.

392
00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:54.175
Don't rush a motherfucker that's trained
to stiff-arm people in the clutch.


393
00:24:55.176 --> 00:24:56.711
He's gonna get the upper hand.

394
00:25:01.382 --> 00:25:05.119
The only reason I bring him up is because
he's about to play football again.


395
00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:10.958
You didn't know that?
The NFL was told by a federal judge


396
00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:12.894
they had to reinstate Ray Rice

397
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.998
because he was transparent
with their investigation.


398
00:25:17.065 --> 00:25:19.667
He told them exactly what he did.

399
00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:23.237
And they can't just change their ruling
just because the tape came out.


400
00:25:23.304 --> 00:25:26.207
I get it. That's like if I'm hanging out
with my buddies, and I'm like,


401
00:25:26.274 --> 00:25:27.842
"Hey, guys, guess what I did last night?

402
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:30.011
I fucked this big, fat girl I met
at the club."


403
00:25:30.078 --> 00:25:32.847
And they're all like,
"Oh, shit, Dave. That's crazy."


404
00:25:35.616 --> 00:25:38.453
And then they see a tape of me doing it,
and they're like...


405
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:43.791
"We can't hang out with you anymore, Dave.

406
00:25:44.792 --> 00:25:46.661
That's not what this crew is all about."

407
00:25:47.995 --> 00:25:49.964
I'd be like, "What?
I told y'all what I did."


408
00:25:53.334 --> 00:25:57.038
What's really fucked up is the tape
was made before they were married.


409
00:25:57.672 --> 00:25:58.773
Isn't that weird?

410
00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:01.843
I don't know why she'd do that.
I don't even know why he would do that.


411
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:04.612
As a guy,
would you want to live with a woman


412
00:26:04.679 --> 00:26:08.216
that you had once punched in the face
with all your strength?


413
00:26:09.384 --> 00:26:11.919
That's some very bold
<i>Color Purple-</i>type shit.


414
00:26:11.986 --> 00:26:14.522
"Celie! Come out here and shave me!"

415
00:26:22.663 --> 00:26:23.965
Are you out of your fucking mind?

416
00:26:30.103 --> 00:26:32.639
I had to ask an older friend of mine,
just to get some perspective,


417
00:26:32.707 --> 00:26:33.875
this older black dude.

418
00:26:34.841 --> 00:26:37.877
Actually the fairest person I've ever met.
And I asked him.


419
00:26:37.944 --> 00:26:42.048
I just said, "Hey, man,
did you see that Ray Rice video?"


420
00:26:42.116 --> 00:26:45.253
And instantly, he was like,
"David, that shit was disgusting."


421
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.556
And then a moment later, he goes...

422
00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:52.326
"I wonder what she said to him."

423
00:26:57.999 --> 00:26:59.734
I don't think that matters.

424
00:27:00.668 --> 00:27:03.104
I think the idea is you're not supposed
to punch her in the face.


425
00:27:04.138 --> 00:27:06.040
Because my wife says terrible shit to me.

426
00:27:06.107 --> 00:27:08.943
My wife once called me a pussy...

427
00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:11.913
in front of dinner guests.

428
00:27:14.182 --> 00:27:16.884
I know. I started to get mad,
but then I was like,


429
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:18.553
"Fuck it. She's probably right."

430
00:27:22.657 --> 00:27:24.625
I am a pussy. I admit it.

431
00:27:25.793 --> 00:27:29.530
I'm soft and warm and persuasive,
like a real pussy.


432
00:27:31.499 --> 00:27:32.500
That's right.

433
00:27:36.204 --> 00:27:39.273
Then I told her, "If you don't take care
of me properly,


434
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.342
I might stink, like your pussy."

435
00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:43.211
Ohh!

436
00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.980
Oh, we fight dirty
at the Chappelle household.


437
00:27:46.047 --> 00:27:47.415
It's not a big deal.

438
00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:53.421
No, no. If you want to get to the bottom
of a matter of the heart,


439
00:27:53.488 --> 00:27:55.556
what you're supposed to do
is ask a woman.


440
00:27:55.623 --> 00:27:57.859
Now, actually,
there's two women that I know...


441
00:27:57.925 --> 00:28:00.895
they're both college professors
in this little area I live in,


442
00:28:00.962 --> 00:28:03.297
and I meet them twice a week
at Starbucks for coffee.


443
00:28:03.364 --> 00:28:05.500
We talk about important shit.

444
00:28:07.869 --> 00:28:09.570
And I asked the girls...
we was in a coffee klatch.


445
00:28:09.637 --> 00:28:12.974
I said, "Yo, why do y'all think
that this woman stayed with Ray Rice


446
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:16.477
after he punched her in the face
with all his strength?"


447
00:28:19.914 --> 00:28:23.317
And one of my girlfriends said,
"David, you need to wake the fuck up.


448
00:28:24.218 --> 00:28:25.920
She's staying for the money."

449
00:28:27.088 --> 00:28:29.590
Now, wait a minute,
'cause my other girlfriend was like,


450
00:28:29.657 --> 00:28:33.661
"I disagree.
I think that she actually loves him."


451
00:28:34.595 --> 00:28:36.531
And I said, "Wait a minute, ladies.
You know what?


452
00:28:36.597 --> 00:28:38.866
I think that you're both right."

453
00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:44.472
And what I was doing when I said that
was preserving the possibility


454
00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:46.507
of a threesome with these bitches.

455
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.212
I'd been chipping away at this pussy

456
00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:53.748
one cup of coffee at a time
for, like, four years.


457
00:28:53.815 --> 00:28:57.485
I wasn't gonna throw that hard work away
with some Ray Rice shit.


458
00:28:57.552 --> 00:28:59.020
I don't care that much.

459
00:29:05.026 --> 00:29:06.260
I'm just being real.

460
00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.097
It's fucked up, man.
It's a tough time for the blacks.


461
00:29:09.163 --> 00:29:11.499
- I love you, Dave!
- I love you, too.


462
00:29:11.566 --> 00:29:14.235
And then here comes the banana peel.
I'm waiting on it any second.


463
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.038
You know that's how it starts.

464
00:29:19.374 --> 00:29:23.878
I saw in the paper today
that the guy that threw the banana at me


465
00:29:23.945 --> 00:29:26.180
got arrested again
'cause he threw a banana


466
00:29:26.247 --> 00:29:28.783
at another motherfucker in a bar
in Santa Fe.


467
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.252
Look it up online after the show.
He actually did that.


468
00:29:31.319 --> 00:29:33.988
And that guy was black, too.
I'm just saying.


469
00:29:35.723 --> 00:29:37.492
And you know why the guy said
he did it that night?


470
00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:40.194
He said, "I did it
'cause Dave Chappelle is racist."


471
00:29:40.261 --> 00:29:44.399
So, nigga? That's not the best way
to handle that if I am racist.


472
00:29:45.133 --> 00:29:46.701
What if Martin Luther King
just went around


473
00:29:46.768 --> 00:29:49.504
throwing tuna casserole on white people?
Would that work?


474
00:29:53.908 --> 00:29:55.777
- Huh?
- Come on, Dave!


475
00:29:55.843 --> 00:29:58.446
Your girl's bubbling.
She's drunk as hell, buddy.


476
00:29:59.814 --> 00:30:01.783
Listen, sir,
I don't know what she's saying,


477
00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:04.085
but just take my advice.
Get some water in her,


478
00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:06.521
or you're gonna have some dry pussy
when you get home.


479
00:30:15.263 --> 00:30:18.032
His dick's gonna be
chafed the fuck up tomorrow.


480
00:30:20.234 --> 00:30:23.504
Santa Maria. Who got a cigarette in here?
Anyone got a cigarette I can borrow?


481
00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:27.341
Yeah. You, fella. Yeah, please.

482
00:30:28.209 --> 00:30:29.811
Ohh!

483
00:30:30.978 --> 00:30:35.416
Let me see. This is a Marlboro menthol.
This could've been anybody.


484
00:30:37.018 --> 00:30:38.820
If it was a Newport, I'd be like,
"A black dude threw that up."


485
00:30:38.886 --> 00:30:42.090
But a Marlboro menthol,
that's one of them riddles.


486
00:30:48.463 --> 00:30:49.464
Oh.

487
00:30:56.304 --> 00:30:57.939
Is the word "pussy" offensive?

488
00:30:58.005 --> 00:30:59.741
No!

489
00:31:01.275 --> 00:31:03.911
All right, just checking, just checking.

490
00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:08.750
I asked that crowd when we was in Denver,
"Is the word 'pussy' offensive?"


491
00:31:08.816 --> 00:31:11.919
And the whole crowd said no,
except for two people.


492
00:31:11.986 --> 00:31:16.991
One was a woman in the front,
older than me, maybe around my age.


493
00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:21.062
Definitely a feminist.
You know what I mean.


494
00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:23.297
Short haircut, plaid shirt.
You know what I'm saying.


495
00:31:25.867 --> 00:31:28.736
And she didn't say it offended her.
What she said is, she said,


496
00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:30.872
"I am uncomfortable with that word."

497
00:31:30.938 --> 00:31:33.141
And I was like, "Really? You?"

498
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:39.213
And before I could ask her why,
there was one guy in the balcony...


499
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.616
I don't think he was saying this to me,
but he said this.


500
00:31:41.683 --> 00:31:45.119
Everybody heard him say it.
He goes, "It's delicious."


501
00:31:45.186 --> 00:31:46.220
I was like, "What?"

502
00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:55.430
I don't think I've ever heard pussy
called delicious before in my life.


503
00:31:55.496 --> 00:31:57.865
Now, this is not
to say that it's bad.

504
00:31:58.933 --> 00:32:01.169
But it's definitely an acquired taste.

505
00:32:03.204 --> 00:32:05.473
I don't think any of us
tasted pussy our first time like...


506
00:32:07.141 --> 00:32:09.010
"Mmm! It's good!"

507
00:32:11.612 --> 00:32:12.814
It needs something.

508
00:32:18.753 --> 00:32:22.056
You know, it's illegal for a gynecologist
to say the word "pussy."


509
00:32:23.224 --> 00:32:24.559
They can only say "vagina,"

510
00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:26.961
or they can name individual parts
medically,


511
00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:30.598
but they can never say shorthand,
even if the gynecologist is a woman.


512
00:32:31.132 --> 00:32:32.800
I feel like if it was
a woman gynecologist, it's cool.


513
00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.869
Like, "Am I all right?"
She's like, "Girl, that pussy is..."


514
00:32:36.003 --> 00:32:38.573
She'd be like, "Yeah."

515
00:32:41.574 --> 00:32:44.310
I don't think men should be allowed
to be gynecologists.


516
00:32:45.446 --> 00:32:47.615
That shit is a conflict of interest.

517
00:32:50.685 --> 00:32:53.821
Even when my wife was pregnant,
we used to go to a gynecologist...


518
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:59.127
and he'd put her legs up
in that stirrup like this.


519
00:32:59.193 --> 00:33:01.362
He'd be like, "All right, Mrs. Chappelle,
just try to relax."


520
00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:03.064
I'd push him.
"Back up, motherfucker! I got this.


521
00:33:03.131 --> 00:33:04.699
Just tell me what to look for."

522
00:33:12.607 --> 00:33:14.609
One of those homestyle checkups.

523
00:33:16.344 --> 00:33:18.279
There's too many ethical questions
when men do that.


524
00:33:18.346 --> 00:33:21.449
Like, can a gynecologist
lose their license...


525
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.952
for smelling their fingers during an exam?

526
00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:26.754
Is that illegal?

527
00:33:29.255 --> 00:33:31.257
How could they not? 
These are men.

528
00:33:33.161 --> 00:33:35.863
It's like if you have a good barbeque,
you don't even think about it.


529
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:36.931
You just...

530
00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:47.875
The word "pussy" is only offensive
if you're older.


531
00:33:47.942 --> 00:33:50.445
People my age and younger,
I don't think we even...


532
00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:52.080
We dance to that shit.

533
00:33:53.581 --> 00:33:55.750
That song comes on the radio...
<i>I beat the pussy up</i>


534
00:33:55.817 --> 00:33:57.985
That's on the radio.
<i>I beat the pussy up</i>


535
00:33:58.052 --> 00:33:59.754
That's a pretty harsh song.

536
00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:04.258
It's nothing like a love song.
There's no tracks of his tears,


537
00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:05.993
no midnight trains to Georgia.

538
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:10.798
This man simply beats the pussy up.

539
00:34:10.865 --> 00:34:13.701
Unbelievable.

540
00:34:14.402 --> 00:34:16.137
You don't even know
if he's having sex with these women.


541
00:34:16.204 --> 00:34:18.873
They might just pull their pants down.
He'd be like, pow!


542
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.108
"G
-Unit!"

543
00:34:24.912 --> 00:34:26.381
You'll be watching HBO.

544
00:34:26.447 --> 00:34:29.384
"Hi, I'm Larry Merchant,
standing here ringside with the pussy


545
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:31.652
after a devastating bout with 50 Cent.

546
00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.288
Pussy, come over here
and let me talk to you for a second.


547
00:34:34.355 --> 00:34:36.858
My God, you look terrible.
Your lips seem to be swollen.


548
00:34:36.924 --> 00:34:38.292
You're bleeding a little bit.

549
00:34:38.359 --> 00:34:41.562
Tell me, pussy, what happened inside
of that ring with 50?"


550
00:34:42.697 --> 00:34:44.665
"I don't know, Larry.
I felt really good in the first round.


551
00:34:44.732 --> 00:34:45.833
I was ready to fight.

552
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:48.770
I was warm and moist, and...

553
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:52.673
I don't know. He just hit me
from angles I wasn't expecting.


554
00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.444
Front, left.
The backside surprised me the most."


555
00:34:58.546 --> 00:35:00.114
"Well, pussy,
let's take a look at round four.


556
00:35:00.181 --> 00:35:02.083
This is where it
all went wrong for you.

557
00:35:03.017 --> 00:35:05.319
Here you come out of your corner, pussy.
You're fighting really good.


558
00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:07.221
It looks like you got 50
with a right and a left,


559
00:35:07.288 --> 00:35:10.458
but then 50 slips you a jab. And there.
There. Right there. You see that?


560
00:35:10.525 --> 00:35:12.326
He punches you right on that...

561
00:35:12.393 --> 00:35:14.429
that little bean thing
you have on the top of your head.


562
00:35:14.495 --> 00:35:15.730
I don't know what that is.

563
00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:19.600
There's 50 just pounding away
at that bean, over and over.


564
00:35:19.667 --> 00:35:22.503
Now, pussy, tell me,
what goes through a fighter's mind


565
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.540
when their bean gets rattled around
like that?"


566
00:35:27.642 --> 00:35:29.010
"I don't think
I was thinking anything, Larry.


567
00:35:29.077 --> 00:35:31.646
I'm a real good defensive fighter.
It's real hard to get to me.


568
00:35:32.947 --> 00:35:35.350
I've never been punched directly
on my bean before.


569
00:35:36.818 --> 00:35:40.254
As a matter of fact, most fighters
don't even know that bean exists.


570
00:35:41.789 --> 00:35:43.858
I guess he just hit me,
then I lost control of my legs.


571
00:35:43.925 --> 00:35:45.193
I don't know what else to tell you."

572
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.899
I like when Lil Wayne talks about pussy,
because he's...


573
00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:54.535
Remember Lil Wayne used to have that song?
He say,


574
00:35:54.602 --> 00:35:57.071
<i>"I got a bitch that plays movies
In my Jacuzzi"</i>


575
00:35:57.138 --> 00:35:58.539
Then he goes like this:

576
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.775
<i>"Pussy juicy"</i>

577
00:36:04.312 --> 00:36:07.148
That shit...
That shit always makes me laugh.


578
00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:10.918
No guy says that.
Only Lil Wayne says some shit like that.


579
00:36:10.985 --> 00:36:12.653
If you was fucking a girl,
and she's like, "Is this pussy good?"


580
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.789
And you're like,
"Yeah, it's juicy. It's good."


581
00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:17.458
The pussy was juicy.

582
00:36:18.693 --> 00:36:22.096
That's why I'm not Lil Wayne.
'Cause if I was in a hot tub with a girl,


583
00:36:22.163 --> 00:36:28.136
and I could tell that the pussy was juicy
while I was in the hot tub,


584
00:36:29.137 --> 00:36:30.772
I'd probably get out of the tub.

585
00:36:32.507 --> 00:36:33.908
I'm a germophobe.

586
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.011
I just picture Lil Wayne like...

587
00:36:38.379 --> 00:36:40.081
"What is this strange oil...

588
00:36:42.216 --> 00:36:44.385
floating in my hot tub water?

589
00:36:46.387 --> 00:36:47.955
It's pussy juice."

590
00:36:50.224 --> 00:36:51.659
That shit was so funny to me,

591
00:36:51.726 --> 00:36:54.962
I must've wrote, like,
no less than 40 jokes


592
00:36:55.029 --> 00:36:56.831
with the punch line "pussy juice,"

593
00:36:57.965 --> 00:37:01.436
and all of them worked to some degree

594
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.806
I'll do one more just so you believe me.
Okay.


595
00:37:06.708 --> 00:37:09.544
All right. In this next piece,

596
00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:13.514
it's a special episode of <i>CSI.</i>

597
00:37:14.949 --> 00:37:17.985
For some reason,
Lil Wayne's guest starring


598
00:37:18.786 --> 00:37:21.089
as the lead detective. Okay?

599
00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:24.359
That's the setup. Are you ready?
Here it goes.


600
00:37:26.594 --> 00:37:29.097
"Has anyone else been
on this crime scene?"


601
00:37:30.998 --> 00:37:31.999
"No."

602
00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:35.937
"It's very strange.

603
00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:41.008
This place is virtually undisturbed.
No forced entry.


604
00:37:41.843 --> 00:37:43.811
No sign of a struggle.

605
00:37:47.115 --> 00:37:49.150
Shine your flashlight right here.
I just slipped in something.


606
00:37:49.217 --> 00:37:50.485
What is this?

607
00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:55.923
What is this?

608
00:37:56.724 --> 00:37:58.659
It glistens in the light.

609
00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:03.831
Smooth to the touch.

610
00:38:10.438 --> 00:38:12.206
This is pussy juice.

611
00:38:19.747 --> 00:38:22.116
She must've been sitting Indian style."

612
00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:25.620
Thirty-nine more where that came from.

613
00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:33.294
Everybody's mad about something.

614
00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:37.732
Recently, I got attacked online
by some gay bloggers,


615
00:38:37.799 --> 00:38:39.300
and it hurt my feelings.

616
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.707
I have no problem with gay people,
but I fucking hate bloggers.


617
00:38:49.644 --> 00:38:51.345
I'm not saying it
'cause this person was gay.


618
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:55.383
They was just acting like a bitch online.
They was mischaracterizing my jokes,


619
00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.219
trying to make a point off of me,
when it was really like...


620
00:38:58.286 --> 00:39:01.055
"Yo, I'm your ally, motherfucker.
I'm not trying to stop gay people.


621
00:39:01.122 --> 00:39:02.557
I got better shit to do."

622
00:39:02.623 --> 00:39:05.760
This motherfucker was saying things,
trying to get gay people to beat me up.


623
00:39:07.528 --> 00:39:08.629
Seriously, he was like...

624
00:39:08.696 --> 00:39:10.231
"Dave Chappelle's jokes..."

625
00:39:10.298 --> 00:39:12.600
I don't know how he actually talks.
I'm just making his voice up.


626
00:39:16.104 --> 00:39:21.275
"Dave Chappelle's jokes were an affront
to the manhood of all gay men."


627
00:39:21.342 --> 00:39:23.311
What the fuck does that mean?

628
00:39:23.378 --> 00:39:27.148
I didn't say anything that would allude
to gay men not being men.


629
00:39:27.215 --> 00:39:28.750
I know you're men.

630
00:39:28.816 --> 00:39:34.522
In fact, what could be manlier
than fucking another guy in the ass?


631
00:39:36.391 --> 00:39:39.727
It's the most gangster shit
I've ever heard of in my life.


632
00:39:41.229 --> 00:39:43.698
I told you, I'm not cut out for that.
I'm a pussy.


633
00:39:46.698 --> 00:39:49.068
You know what I said?
This is all I said.


634
00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:51.205
First of all,
I'll tell you right now what I said,


635
00:39:51.272 --> 00:39:54.709
and I'll tell you this was not a joke.
It's a true story,


636
00:39:54.776 --> 00:39:56.411
and I just happened to tell it.

637
00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:59.681
What happened was,
I went to a gallery party, all right?


638
00:39:59.747 --> 00:40:02.083
I don't know who in here
has ever been rich before,


639
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.885
but these are very nice parties.

640
00:40:04.786 --> 00:40:07.555
You know, wine and cheese
and baller conversation.


641
00:40:09.457 --> 00:40:11.426
And there was a few eccentric types,

642
00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:15.329
one of which was a very wealthy man
that happened to be wearing a dress.


643
00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:19.067
I don't know what you call him.
A tranny, or a drag queen, perhaps.


644
00:40:19.133 --> 00:40:21.602
Whatever he was, he was definitely a man.

645
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.940
And this man was definitely on drugs.

646
00:40:26.007 --> 00:40:29.477
I don't know what kind of drugs he was on,
but I knew he had too much.


647
00:40:29.544 --> 00:40:32.313
He didn't look good. 
He was like this.

648
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.083
He looked sick, and all his friends
were standing around him,


649
00:40:35.149 --> 00:40:37.118
concerned, trying to revive him.

650
00:40:37.185 --> 00:40:39.320
I don't know what,
it looked like some kind of gay CPR.


651
00:40:39.387 --> 00:40:41.056
There was fanning and shit.
They was like...


652
00:40:47.228 --> 00:40:48.963
I saw all this from a distance.

653
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.432
Now, I should've minded my own business,
but I got curious.


654
00:40:51.499 --> 00:40:52.500
I was like...

655
00:40:55.236 --> 00:40:58.673
And I went over there.
All I said, "Excuse me, gentlemen.


656
00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.108
Is he okay?"

657
00:41:00.174 --> 00:41:02.176
Then they looked at
me like I was evil.

658
00:41:05.046 --> 00:41:07.248
<i>"She</i>is fine."

659
00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.818
I said, "Word? Oh.

660
00:41:12.186 --> 00:41:14.222
I'm sorry. I didn't know
this is what we were doing."


661
00:41:16.691 --> 00:41:18.059
Here's my thing.

662
00:41:19.158 --> 00:41:21.827
I support anybody's right

663
00:41:21.894 --> 00:41:24.530
to be whoever
they feel like they are inside.


664
00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:26.000
I'm your ally in that.

665
00:41:26.701 --> 00:41:27.869
However...

666
00:41:29.203 --> 00:41:30.671
my question is...

667
00:41:31.939 --> 00:41:36.477
to what degree do I have to participate
in your self-image?


668
00:41:37.378 --> 00:41:41.349
Is it fair that I have to change my whole
pronoun game up for this motherfucker?


669
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:42.417
That doesn't make sense.

670
00:41:45.787 --> 00:41:46.988
Seriously.

671
00:41:48.022 --> 00:41:49.657
If I put on an argyle sweater,

672
00:41:49.724 --> 00:41:51.959
and I'm like, "Hey, everybody,
I feel like a white guy in this sweater,


673
00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:54.128
and I want some goddamn respect
and a bank loan,"


674
00:41:54.195 --> 00:41:55.530
that's not gonna work.

675
00:41:56.564 --> 00:41:59.000
You don't give a fuck how I feel.
Why should I give a fuck how you feel?


676
00:41:59.067 --> 00:42:00.535
"Nigger" is a pronoun.

677
00:42:02.637 --> 00:42:04.505
But there was no time
for philosophical debate.


678
00:42:04.572 --> 00:42:06.140
This was an emergency situation.

679
00:42:06.974 --> 00:42:10.311
I said, "Fine. I'm sorry, guys.
I was just worried because...


680
00:42:11.646 --> 00:42:13.147
because she looks terrible.

681
00:42:15.149 --> 00:42:17.185
And she just fell off the bench.

682
00:42:18.553 --> 00:42:21.089
It appears that her dick
is popping out of her dress.


683
00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:25.226
You mind if I call an ambulance, champ?

684
00:42:25.293 --> 00:42:27.295
I'd rather not be at a party
where a tranny OD's.


685
00:42:27.362 --> 00:42:29.163
There's too many questions to answer."

686
00:42:42.276 --> 00:42:43.878
Okay, I've been through this before.

687
00:42:43.945 --> 00:42:45.880
I had a friend from high school.

688
00:42:45.947 --> 00:42:50.551
Now, in high school, this guy was a thug.
He was a fucking dope boy.


689
00:42:50.618 --> 00:42:53.788
He did it all. He was a wild dude.
People used to be very scared of him.


690
00:42:53.855 --> 00:42:55.456
And then after high school,

691
00:42:55.523 --> 00:42:58.259
word on the street was
he had come out the closet.


692
00:42:58.326 --> 00:42:59.861
I personally didn't believe it.

693
00:43:00.695 --> 00:43:04.132
I bring him up because last year,
he calls me out of the blue,


694
00:43:04.198 --> 00:43:06.634
like, "Yo, what's up, man?
I got your number from so-and-so.


695
00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:09.237
I heard you're gonna be in New York
doing a show. Could I get some tickets?"


696
00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:11.506
I was like, "Fuck yeah,
you can get some tickets. How you been?"


697
00:43:11.572 --> 00:43:15.443
He said, "We'll catch up at the show,
but I appreciate it. I'll see you soon."


698
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.745
I said, "All right, man. Take care."
I was about to hang up,


699
00:43:17.812 --> 00:43:19.781
but I couldn't resist. 
I was just like,

700
00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:22.316
"Hey, nigga, I heard you was gay.
What's going on with that?"


701
00:43:28.556 --> 00:43:30.091
And I wish I didn't ask.

702
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:33.327
'Cause he sounded like he was dying
to talk about that shit,


703
00:43:33.394 --> 00:43:35.463
and he had a long story about it.

704
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:39.801
It's not that I didn't care, but I was...
I don't like talking on the phone.


705
00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:41.969
I was watching TV at the same time.

706
00:43:42.804 --> 00:43:45.139
So, I just wasn't really paying attention
like I should.


707
00:43:45.206 --> 00:43:47.709
I was trying to sound supportive,
but I didn't really know what to say.


708
00:43:47.775 --> 00:43:50.178
So, I just mumbled and shit
throughout this conversation.


709
00:43:50.244 --> 00:43:53.314
I was like, "Well, you know, nigga,
you're gay, man. You're just gay.


710
00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:54.549
Come on, man."

711
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.755
This went on for a while.

712
00:44:00.822 --> 00:44:04.192
Then finally, I had to say something
definitive to get him off the phone.


713
00:44:04.258 --> 00:44:08.396
And I was like, "Hey, you know what?
Don't let people get you down, all right?


714
00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:11.132
And the next time someone tries
to make you feel bad about yourself,


715
00:44:11.199 --> 00:44:14.235
just remember:
Everybody fucks funny to somebody."


716
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:21.476
He didn't like that shit.

717
00:44:22.543 --> 00:44:24.812
He said, "What the fuck does that mean?"
I said, "Huh?"


718
00:44:24.879 --> 00:44:26.514
He said, "You saying I fuck funny,
motherfucker?"


719
00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:28.850
I said, "No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying everybody's different."


720
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:31.386
He said, "You didn't say 'different.'
You said 'funny.'


721
00:44:31.452 --> 00:44:33.521
What's so fucking funny
about the way I fuck?"


722
00:44:33.588 --> 00:44:36.157
And I said, "Hey, man, I fuck feet."

723
00:44:36.224 --> 00:44:37.492
He said, "What?!"

724
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.195
Oh, this is not a joke,
ladies and gentlemen.


725
00:44:41.262 --> 00:44:44.098
I get women to squeeze their feet together
like this,


726
00:44:44.165 --> 00:44:46.801
and I fuck them right
in that little space in their feet.


727
00:44:50.204 --> 00:44:52.607
But you can't build a community
behind that shit.


728
00:44:54.675 --> 00:44:56.744
There's no flag for us.

729
00:45:00.715 --> 00:45:02.450
That shit made him laugh.

730
00:45:03.918 --> 00:45:05.119
The next day,

731
00:45:06.187 --> 00:45:07.922
after the show, 
I saw him backstage.

732
00:45:07.989 --> 00:45:10.625
He was like, "What's up, man?
I'm like, "Oh, shit! What's going on?"


733
00:45:10.692 --> 00:45:13.561
He had his buddy with him.
He goes, "Dave, I want you to meet Manuel.


734
00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:16.764
Manuel's my fiancĂ©. We're in New York
getting married 'cause it's legal here."


735
00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:21.269
I said, "Oh.
Well, congratulations, fellas."


736
00:45:22.036 --> 00:45:23.671
And Manuel was like, <i>"Gracias."</i>

737
00:45:23.738 --> 00:45:25.473
And he went to go get some drinks,

738
00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.242
and then my buddy looked at me.
He was like, "So, Dave...


739
00:45:29.277 --> 00:45:30.478
what do you think?"

740
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.282
And I started mumbling again.

741
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:36.818
"Well, you're gay, nigga.
You know, you're just gay."


742
00:45:39.554 --> 00:45:41.789
He said, "I'm a little nervous
about getting married, man.


743
00:45:41.856 --> 00:45:42.990
It's a big step."

744
00:45:43.057 --> 00:45:44.659
I said, "Yeah, it is. 
It's a big step."

745
00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.528
He said,
"You've been married for a while.


746
00:45:48.262 --> 00:45:49.864
You got any advice for us?"

747
00:45:51.532 --> 00:45:53.968
"No, I'm married to a woman.
Sorry about that."


748
00:45:55.837 --> 00:46:00.241
And he corrected me. He said,
"No. You married the person that you love,


749
00:46:00.308 --> 00:46:02.143
so it's essentially the same."

750
00:46:03.277 --> 00:46:06.047
I said, "You know, man,
the problem with that statement


751
00:46:06.114 --> 00:46:08.816
is that it makes the assumption
that I love her. But..."


752
00:46:13.888 --> 00:46:16.991
Will you guys lighten the fuck up?
Of course I love my wife.


753
00:46:18.426 --> 00:46:19.560
She laughs at this shit.

754
00:46:19.627 --> 00:46:21.696
As a matter of fact,
she eats and spends this shit.


755
00:46:24.132 --> 00:46:27.135
No, I told him, I said,
"You know what you should do, man?


756
00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.704
First of all, you shouldn't do it."

757
00:46:30.838 --> 00:46:32.440
I'm talking about being legally married.

758
00:46:32.507 --> 00:46:35.576
It's not that you're gay
as much as just legal marriage


759
00:46:35.643 --> 00:46:39.147
is a fucking diabolical leverage game
in the United States.


760
00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:40.815
I'm just being honest.

761
00:46:40.882 --> 00:46:43.918
Devoid of religious significance
or the idea of love,


762
00:46:43.985 --> 00:46:47.221
marriage is nothing but an awful contract
that you shouldn't sign.


763
00:46:50.391 --> 00:46:51.693
I'm just being real.

764
00:46:54.262 --> 00:46:56.064
Because you start out loving each other.

765
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.133
Then two years later, you're just
building a case against one another...


766
00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:03.304
for a hypothetical court date
that may or may not ever happen.


767
00:47:05.473 --> 00:47:08.643
You throw being gay on top of that,
that shit is explosive.


768
00:47:09.477 --> 00:47:10.712
It's that Ray Rice shit.

769
00:47:10.778 --> 00:47:13.314
Right after Ray Rice
went through all that shit,


770
00:47:13.381 --> 00:47:15.450
I was at a party
and I met this kid Michael Sam.


771
00:47:15.516 --> 00:47:17.952
You know Michael Sam? 
Very nice guy.

772
00:47:18.019 --> 00:47:20.822
He's the first openly gay NFL player.

773
00:47:20.888 --> 00:47:23.858
And Michael's a very nice guy,
a very brave guy,


774
00:47:23.925 --> 00:47:25.927
but when I met him,
I couldn't help but think,


775
00:47:25.993 --> 00:47:30.198
"What's gonna happen when Michael Sam
beats <i>his</i>wife up in the elevator?


776
00:47:30.932 --> 00:47:32.100
Is that domestic violence,

777
00:47:32.166 --> 00:47:34.869
or is that just two niggas
working shit out in an elevator?"


778
00:47:34.936 --> 00:47:35.937
You know what I mean?

779
00:47:47.949 --> 00:47:49.017
Anyway...

780
00:47:50.184 --> 00:47:53.388
I give all married men the same advice,
gay or straight.


781
00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:54.822
Get a dog.

782
00:47:56.491 --> 00:47:59.527
Because a dog will love you all the time,
but she's not going to.


783
00:48:01.896 --> 00:48:04.699
It was real talk.
I didn't even know about dogs,


784
00:48:04.766 --> 00:48:06.467
and my kids got the dog.

785
00:48:06.534 --> 00:48:08.603
They brought him home from the shelter.
I didn't even want him.


786
00:48:08.669 --> 00:48:10.705
They were like, "Can we keep him?"
I said, "Nope."


787
00:48:10.772 --> 00:48:13.207
I said, "Where did you get this dog?"
They're like, "From the shelter."


788
00:48:13.274 --> 00:48:14.275
I was like, "Ugh.

789
00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:17.245
Probably something wrong with him.

790
00:48:18.846 --> 00:48:19.847
Can't keep him."

791
00:48:19.914 --> 00:48:22.083
And then my kids started crying
and screaming


792
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:23.651
like the dog had gambling debts.

793
00:48:23.718 --> 00:48:25.887
"Please, Dad!
If you don't let us keep him,


794
00:48:25.953 --> 00:48:27.155
they're gonna kill him!"

795
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:28.256
I was like, "Oh...

796
00:48:30.725 --> 00:48:32.160
All right, you can keep him."

797
00:48:32.226 --> 00:48:34.228
And this dog was a menace.

798
00:48:36.297 --> 00:48:37.665
I hated his guts.

799
00:48:38.933 --> 00:48:43.237
One night, I'd smoked a bunch of weed,
and I was eating a sandwich,


800
00:48:43.304 --> 00:48:45.139
and Baba came over...
Baba is the dog.


801
00:48:45.206 --> 00:48:46.741
He came over and was staring at me.

802
00:48:46.808 --> 00:48:49.277
This will make you very uncomfortable,
if he's just looking at you eating.


803
00:48:57.218 --> 00:48:59.954
I had to give him a piece of my sandwich
so he'd go away,


804
00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:01.756
and that's how we became friends.

805
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:05.693
Now, if you see me walking down the street
with Baba,


806
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.363
I ain't got no leash or nothing.
He walks right next to me.


807
00:49:08.429 --> 00:49:10.765
If I stop, he'll stop.
And if I go, he'll go.


808
00:49:10.832 --> 00:49:13.334
And all my friends are like,
"Yo, Dave, that shit is dope.


809
00:49:13.401 --> 00:49:15.236
How'd you train Baba to do that shit?"

810
00:49:17.004 --> 00:49:18.473
"I've never trained Baba.

811
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.875
I'm just a messy eater."

812
00:49:22.577 --> 00:49:25.713
If I drop food and Baba's not around,
all I gotta do is call him.


813
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:26.781
"Baba!"

814
00:49:27.982 --> 00:49:30.251
He's a black dude's dog,
so he doesn't come right away.


815
00:49:30.318 --> 00:49:32.553
He peeks first to see what's going on.

816
00:49:37.759 --> 00:49:39.394
I gotta tap my foot
so he can see the food.


817
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.461
"Over here, little buddy."

818
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:45.967
He's like, "Thanks, Dave,"
and he'll come get it and run off.


819
00:49:46.034 --> 00:49:48.636
But he knows all my habits.
If he smells weed in the house,


820
00:49:48.703 --> 00:49:49.971
he'll be like...

821
00:49:50.038 --> 00:49:52.473
"Oh, this motherfucker's about to eat."
And he'll just come running.


822
00:50:00.214 --> 00:50:03.251
Baba got me through a very difficult time
in my marriage.


823
00:50:04.619 --> 00:50:06.721
We spend the most time together.

824
00:50:06.788 --> 00:50:08.523
It's not that me and my wife
don't spend time together,


825
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:11.759
but we've been married so long,
we don't talk like...


826
00:50:11.826 --> 00:50:14.796
I don't know if anyone's married here,
but after ten years,


827
00:50:14.862 --> 00:50:18.099
all that chatty shit goes away.
You've said it all.


828
00:50:18.166 --> 00:50:21.302
You know what I mean.
Yeah. We're just in the zone.


829
00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:25.940
She says the same shit to me every night
before she goes to bed.


830
00:50:26.007 --> 00:50:28.910
I'll be the last one up. She's like,
"I'm gonna get some sleep, Dave.


831
00:50:28.976 --> 00:50:29.977
Good night."

832
00:50:30.044 --> 00:50:32.680
"All right, babe. I'm gonna stay up
and watch television. Good night."


833
00:50:32.747 --> 00:50:35.216
Then she'll walk halfway up the steps.

834
00:50:35.283 --> 00:50:36.651
"David?"

835
00:50:36.718 --> 00:50:37.752
"Hmm?"

836
00:50:40.254 --> 00:50:43.057
"Don't eat the kids' lunch."
And then she walks away.


837
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:52.100
Well, the crazy shit is,
I don't even eat their lunch anymore.


838
00:50:53.067 --> 00:50:56.104
Back in the day, I used to eat that shit.
You know how that goes.


839
00:50:56.904 --> 00:50:58.639
Now I might smoke some weed
in the middle of the night,


840
00:50:58.706 --> 00:51:01.743
and she'll leave neatly-wrapped sandwiches
all over the kitchen.


841
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:03.745
I'm gonna eat it.

842
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.583
What's the big deal? Why can't she
just make another one in the morning?


843
00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:11.052
I mean, I got sons anyway.

844
00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:13.254
And sons love everything their dads do.

845
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:15.223
My kids will be at school
the next day like,


846
00:51:15.289 --> 00:51:19.260
"Oh, Dad bit my sandwich. Oh, shit!"

847
00:51:21.029 --> 00:51:23.398
Their dad is Dave Chappelle, man.

848
00:51:23.464 --> 00:51:25.566
You could trade that sandwich
for something better.


849
00:51:27.869 --> 00:51:30.438
What I'm doing is adding value
to their lunch.


850
00:51:32.607 --> 00:51:34.709
But she doesn't understand these types
of things.


851
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:36.778
Anyway, she gets mad at me.

852
00:51:36.844 --> 00:51:39.947
She's mad at me now
'cause I got myself in trouble.


853
00:51:40.014 --> 00:51:44.252
I got myself extorted,
which happens in this business.


854
00:51:44.318 --> 00:51:46.154
I come home from the road.

855
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.056
There was a FedEx sitting
on the kitchen table,


856
00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:50.992
and it was addressed to me,
so I opened it.


857
00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:52.527
I don't know who delivered it.

858
00:51:52.593 --> 00:51:55.797
And there was a videocassette inside
with a note written on it


859
00:51:55.863 --> 00:51:57.265
that said, "Gotcha."

860
00:51:57.331 --> 00:52:00.234
Oh, my God. Can you imagine?
I freaked out.


861
00:52:00.301 --> 00:52:03.571
I tore the whole house apart,
trying to find a VCR.


862
00:52:03.638 --> 00:52:05.640
I hadn't seen a
tape in over a decade.

863
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.512
And I watched the tape, and it was awful.
They got me.


864
00:52:11.579 --> 00:52:15.717
It was a tape of me...
I was fucking a girl, okay?


865
00:52:15.783 --> 00:52:19.087
But it was from before I was married.
But it was not a good look.


866
00:52:19.153 --> 00:52:23.124
And I felt sick to my stomach,
and I looked up at the clock,


867
00:52:23.191 --> 00:52:25.793
and then I saw my wife was coming home
in ten minutes,


868
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.595
and I just panicked.

869
00:52:27.662 --> 00:52:31.833
I jerked off to the tape real fast,
and then...


870
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.775
and then I called the FBI.

871
00:52:45.046 --> 00:52:47.749
Who, by the way,
made me feel much better.


872
00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.285
They didn't say
they were gonna catch 'em for sure,


873
00:52:51.352 --> 00:52:54.889
but they had the demeanor of some
confident people that would catch 'em.


874
00:52:54.956 --> 00:52:57.525
So, I didn't worry about it too much.

875
00:52:57.592 --> 00:53:00.395
And then, not even a week later,
five days later, I come home,


876
00:53:00.461 --> 00:53:02.830
and there's another videocassette sitting
on my porch.


877
00:53:02.897 --> 00:53:04.632
As soon as I saw it,
I just called the police.


878
00:53:04.699 --> 00:53:05.967
"They've done it again.

879
00:53:06.034 --> 00:53:08.236
You should probably look for a guy
with bell-bottoms on,


880
00:53:08.302 --> 00:53:11.572
because I don't know who the fuck
is sending tapes!"


881
00:53:18.913 --> 00:53:22.517
And that second tape was the worst shit
I'd ever seen in my life. It was awful.


882
00:53:22.583 --> 00:53:26.854
Career-ending bad.
It was a tape of me...


883
00:53:28.723 --> 00:53:30.658
jerking off to the tape a week earlier.

884
00:53:30.725 --> 00:53:34.095
I don't even know how they'd
even get such a thing.


885
00:53:36.497 --> 00:53:39.667
I had to explain all
of this to my wife.

886
00:53:40.902 --> 00:53:42.403
She was very mad.

887
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:47.208
No thing in this world is as cold
as a woman's cold shoulder,


888
00:53:47.275 --> 00:53:50.278
'cause she was mad,
but she wouldn't talk to me about it.


889
00:53:50.344 --> 00:53:54.415
She would just punish me in little ways,
make me do shit that I hate to do.


890
00:53:56.984 --> 00:53:59.854
Like pick the kids up from school.
That's one thing she made me do.


891
00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:01.923
That's a hardship for me.

892
00:54:03.825 --> 00:54:07.128
I got one son that goes
to a public school.


893
00:54:07.195 --> 00:54:08.696
And...

894
00:54:10.631 --> 00:54:13.968
his little brother goes
to a private school.


895
00:54:14.969 --> 00:54:17.538
It's an experiment. I just want to see
what's gonna happen to them.


896
00:54:23.745 --> 00:54:26.414
But what's weird is,
my little son in private school,


897
00:54:26.481 --> 00:54:29.951
he's, like, my thuggy son,
you know what I mean?


898
00:54:30.018 --> 00:54:33.087
I don't know where he gets that from.
He's not getting it from me.


899
00:54:33.821 --> 00:54:36.224
And he's definitely not getting it
from that school.


900
00:54:36.858 --> 00:54:39.027
That school is very...
It's a liberal school.


901
00:54:39.093 --> 00:54:40.395
It's the kind of school...

902
00:54:40.461 --> 00:54:44.198
there might be, like,

903
00:54:44.265 --> 00:54:46.034
and I'm the only black parent.

904
00:54:53.741 --> 00:54:55.710
And none of the parents like me, either.

905
00:54:56.377 --> 00:54:58.446
Not 'cause I'm black,
but they don't like how I roll.


906
00:54:58.513 --> 00:55:02.050
I'll be showing up late all the time,
and I'm, like, in a Porsche,


907
00:55:02.116 --> 00:55:04.585
and I'm blasting music
that they don't like.


908
00:55:04.652 --> 00:55:06.054
<i>I beat the pussy up</i>

909
00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.989
Then I pull into the parking lot.

910
00:55:08.756 --> 00:55:11.325
I might be smoking a cigarette
with the kids in the car.


911
00:55:13.127 --> 00:55:15.730
Then I pull into that handicapped space.

912
00:55:16.364 --> 00:55:17.865
And when I get out
of the handicapped space,


913
00:55:17.932 --> 00:55:19.901
they always want to say
some passive-aggressive shit.


914
00:55:19.967 --> 00:55:22.704
"Morning, Dave.
Don't know if you noticed,


915
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:25.273
but you actually parked
in the handicapped space."


916
00:55:25.339 --> 00:55:27.775
"Yeah, you know, Frank, I did notice.

917
00:55:27.842 --> 00:55:31.312
But who is this handicapped guy
we're all waiting on that never shows up?"


918
00:55:41.055 --> 00:55:42.557
So, I hate going over to that school.

919
00:55:42.623 --> 00:55:45.827
The only parents that are nice to me
is a lesbian couple...


920
00:55:45.893 --> 00:55:47.462
Kate and Sarah.

921
00:55:47.528 --> 00:55:51.666
Actually, Kate hates my guts.
Sarah knows that I'm black,


922
00:55:51.733 --> 00:55:54.769
and she's half-black,
so she just understands me.


923
00:55:55.536 --> 00:55:58.406
You know what I'm saying?
I can't explain it.


924
00:55:59.607 --> 00:56:00.842
Because I'll say shit,

925
00:56:00.908 --> 00:56:02.877
and Kate's just too serious
about being a lesbian.


926
00:56:02.944 --> 00:56:05.046
I'll be like, "Hey, Kate. Hey, Sarah.

927
00:56:06.714 --> 00:56:08.549
You guys going
to the father-son picnic next week?


928
00:56:08.616 --> 00:56:09.717
How's that gonna work?"

929
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.788
And Kate will instantly be furious.

930
00:56:13.855 --> 00:56:16.591
But Sarah knows I'm fucking around,
so she'll just say something cool.


931
00:56:16.657 --> 00:56:19.293
"I don't know, Dave. Maybe me and Kate
will flip for that shit."


932
00:56:21.662 --> 00:56:23.531
I said, "Bitch,
you better save that coin toss,


933
00:56:23.598 --> 00:56:26.534
because everybody knows
you're strapping on in that household."


934
00:56:28.002 --> 00:56:30.705
And then Kate will turn bright red,
but Sarah just fist-bumps me,


935
00:56:30.772 --> 00:56:32.974
like, "You're right, nigga. It's me. Bop."

936
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:36.377
We're good friends.

937
00:56:37.345 --> 00:56:38.946
We're good friends.
They invite me to stuff.


938
00:56:39.013 --> 00:56:40.748
They're my only friends at the school.

939
00:56:40.815 --> 00:56:42.050
So, imagine my surprise

940
00:56:42.116 --> 00:56:44.652
when I go to pick my son up
after all this happens.


941
00:56:44.719 --> 00:56:47.355
And the teacher is waiting outside for me.

942
00:56:47.422 --> 00:56:50.725
She's just standing right there
in the middle of the handicapped space.


943
00:56:54.228 --> 00:56:56.297
I knew something was wrong,
so I rolled the window down.


944
00:56:56.364 --> 00:56:57.699
"What's going on?"

945
00:56:57.765 --> 00:57:00.702
"Hi, David. Can we talk to you
for a minute in the office?"


946
00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:02.470
I said, "No, fuck that.
We gotta talk right here.


947
00:57:02.537 --> 00:57:03.571
What's going on?"

948
00:57:04.539 --> 00:57:05.707
I knew it was bad.

949
00:57:07.775 --> 00:57:09.544
"Ibrahim had a fight."

950
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:13.448
I said, "A fight?"
"Don't worry. Everyone's okay."


951
00:57:14.282 --> 00:57:15.917
I said, "Everyone?

952
00:57:18.353 --> 00:57:19.787
What happened?"

953
00:57:19.854 --> 00:57:21.422
"Well, that's it.
We don't know what happened


954
00:57:21.489 --> 00:57:22.990
because he won't talk to anybody.

955
00:57:23.057 --> 00:57:26.294
All we know is that he punched Sarah Jr.
in the face."


956
00:57:26.361 --> 00:57:27.662
I said, "Oh, no!"

957
00:57:28.296 --> 00:57:31.766
Sarah's one of the only parents
I'm not sure I can beat up in this school.


958
00:57:32.633 --> 00:57:35.169
Just then, Kate and Sarah pulled up
to pick up their daughter,


959
00:57:35.236 --> 00:57:37.238
and then we all had
to go into the office,

960
00:57:37.305 --> 00:57:41.109
and I was really worried 'cause I didn't
want them to kick me out of the school.


961
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.679
And then they brought my son in.
He was crying.


962
00:57:44.746 --> 00:57:46.447
They brought him in like a prisoner.

963
00:57:47.315 --> 00:57:48.850
He was like, "Ohh! Oh!"

964
00:57:48.916 --> 00:57:51.386
I said, "Son, stop crying, calm down.

965
00:57:51.452 --> 00:57:54.589
Do not look at these mean faces.
I need you to look at my face,


966
00:57:54.655 --> 00:57:57.859
and I need you to tell me the truth,
buddy, all right?


967
00:57:57.925 --> 00:58:00.028
Just tell me the truth. Is it true?

968
00:58:00.094 --> 00:58:02.563
Did you punch that girl Sarah Jr.
in the face?"


969
00:58:03.631 --> 00:58:06.034
I was trying to give him a signal to lie,
but he didn't pick up on it.


970
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:07.101
I was like...

971
00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:16.144
He wasn't paying attention. He's like,
"Yes, Daddy, I punched her face."


972
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:18.813
"Oh, my God. Why? 
Why would you do that?

973
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.115
You're not supposed to put your hands
on anybody."


974
00:58:21.983 --> 00:58:24.786
And his answer was so gangster,
it scared all the parents in the room.


975
00:58:24.852 --> 00:58:25.853
He was like...

976
00:58:27.822 --> 00:58:29.290
"'Cause she had it coming."

977
00:58:29.357 --> 00:58:30.358
I said...

978
00:58:35.596 --> 00:58:36.631
And everyone looked at me.

979
00:58:36.698 --> 00:58:38.700
I said, "I did not teach him.
I don't know where he got that from."


980
00:58:38.766 --> 00:58:42.303
I said, "What does that mean, son?
That is crazy talk! What does that mean?"


981
00:58:43.237 --> 00:58:45.206
And then he just started crying
like he was Tupac.


982
00:58:46.407 --> 00:58:50.411
"These kids keep fucking with me!"

983
00:58:58.219 --> 00:59:00.154
I told his teacher, I said,
"Well, now, wait a minute.


984
00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:02.357
This kid is a lot of things,
but he's not a liar.


985
00:59:02.423 --> 00:59:04.892
And if he said they was fucking with him,
they did something to him.


986
00:59:04.959 --> 00:59:06.594
Son, what's going on?
What did they do to you?"


987
00:59:06.661 --> 00:59:09.230
"Dad, I'm tired of this shit.
It's been going on all week."


988
00:59:09.297 --> 00:59:10.631
I said, "What's going on all week?"

989
00:59:10.698 --> 00:59:14.235
He said, "We was at lunch,
and that bitch bit my sandwich."


990
00:59:14.302 --> 00:59:15.770
I said, "Oh."

991
00:59:20.942 --> 00:59:24.912
He said, "It's the fourth time this week.
I'm tired of this sandwich-biting bitch."


992
00:59:26.581 --> 00:59:28.750
I said, "Stop using that word.
Let's go home."


993
00:59:32.286 --> 00:59:34.188
That's a quiet car ride home.

994
00:59:35.123 --> 00:59:37.258
We got to the house,
he just ran right up to his room,


995
00:59:37.325 --> 00:59:38.593
slammed the door.

996
00:59:39.394 --> 00:59:42.563
His mother came downstairs.
By then, she'd heard about everything.


997
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.165
She was looking at me,
like, "Oh, my God."


998
00:59:44.232 --> 00:59:45.933
I said, "I know. 
It's fucked up."

999
00:59:49.604 --> 00:59:52.640
She said, "You bit that goddamn sandwich,
didn't you, Dave?"


1000
00:59:56.407 --> 00:59:58.442
I said,
"I'm tired of you accusing me of shit!"


1001
00:59:58.513 --> 01:00:00.248
And I just ran out of the house.

1002
01:00:01.049 --> 01:00:04.252
Jumped in my car and drove off.
Of course I bit that sandwich.


1003
01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:09.357
But I knew that she was just
really mad about that tape,


1004
01:00:09.424 --> 01:00:12.326
so now she was gonna punish me
about a fucking sandwich that I'd bit.


1005
01:00:12.393 --> 01:00:14.328
I was mad as fuck.
You know what I said to myself?


1006
01:00:14.395 --> 01:00:16.898
I said, "I should just never go home.
Fuck this shit."


1007
01:00:16.964 --> 01:00:20.401
By the way, that's how people
used to get divorced in the '40s.


1008
01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:22.937
There wasn't no divorce court in America.

1009
01:00:23.004 --> 01:00:24.706
Back in those days,
if you wanted to get out your marriage,


1010
01:00:24.772 --> 01:00:27.375
you'd just tell your wife, "Hey, baby,
I'm gonna get a pack of cigarettes.


1011
01:00:27.442 --> 01:00:28.443
I'll be right back."

1012
01:00:29.343 --> 01:00:31.713
You would just leave
with the clothes on your back.


1013
01:00:32.847 --> 01:00:34.248
That's when men were men.

1014
01:00:35.817 --> 01:00:37.585
And there was no Internet back then,

1015
01:00:37.652 --> 01:00:40.755
so you could move 11 miles away
and have a whole new life.


1016
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:50.498
But I ended up going back home...

1017
01:00:53.201 --> 01:00:54.535
late at night,

1018
01:00:55.303 --> 01:00:57.672
and came in the room,
and she was actually changing for bed.


1019
01:00:57.739 --> 01:00:59.273
You can always tell
your wife is mad at you


1020
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.642
when they cover their titties up
when you walk in. "Oh!"


1021
01:01:03.177 --> 01:01:05.012
"Let those titties out. 
It's me, baby.

1022
01:01:07.215 --> 01:01:09.117
Can we just talk
about this for a minute?"

1023
01:01:09.183 --> 01:01:10.785
She said, "David,
there's nothing to talk about.


1024
01:01:10.852 --> 01:01:12.053
I already know you bit the sandwich.

1025
01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.921
And don't go looking for their lunch.
I hid it."


1026
01:01:16.424 --> 01:01:18.026
I said, "I don't want to talk
about the sandwich.


1027
01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:21.596
I want to talk about <i>it.</i>The tape.

1028
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:23.865
I know that's why you're mad."

1029
01:01:25.299 --> 01:01:27.135
It was a very difficult conversation.

1030
01:01:27.969 --> 01:01:29.871
I had to crack a few jokes.

1031
01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:32.340
And she laughed a little,
and it helped her relax,


1032
01:01:32.407 --> 01:01:36.244
and we started talking,
and then she cracked a few jokes...


1033
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.846
that hurt my feelings, honestly. But...

1034
01:01:47.385 --> 01:01:49.186
But we talked.
And you know what she told me?


1035
01:01:50.024 --> 01:01:54.429
She told me that she was madder
about the second extortion tape


1036
01:01:54.495 --> 01:01:56.330
than she was about the first one.

1037
01:01:57.331 --> 01:01:58.766
Which doesn't make sense at all.

1038
01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:01.469
What's wrong with a guy
touching his own private parts?


1039
01:02:02.403 --> 01:02:04.672
It's my own business.
It's not like I do it all the time.


1040
01:02:04.739 --> 01:02:07.742
As a matter of fact,
sometimes I do it for her benefit.


1041
01:02:07.809 --> 01:02:11.079
A lot of guys do this.
It's called the mercy jerk.


1042
01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.349
That's the one that happens
in the middle of the night


1043
01:02:14.415 --> 01:02:16.451
when you're about to roll on top of her
and you see her face,


1044
01:02:16.517 --> 01:02:18.920
and you're like, "She looks tired."

1045
01:02:21.522 --> 01:02:23.124
That takes a lot of love and discipline

1046
01:02:23.191 --> 01:02:25.293
to back out of a room
with a rock-hard dick.


1047
01:02:29.897 --> 01:02:31.132
Sometimes I don't make it.

1048
01:02:31.199 --> 01:02:33.568
"Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

1049
01:02:35.103 --> 01:02:37.839
Someone fell asleep with their socks off,
didn't they?"


1050
01:02:41.776 --> 01:02:43.411
You can't rape feet.

1051
01:02:45.313 --> 01:02:47.048
You can't rape feet.

1052
01:02:51.319 --> 01:02:54.856
The only time I jerk off now
is if I know how long she'll be gone.


1053
01:02:54.922 --> 01:02:56.591
That's the only way I can get my head
in the game.


1054
01:02:57.625 --> 01:03:01.095
Sometimes she'll tell me, "Dave, I'm gonna
take the kids to my mom's real quick.


1055
01:03:01.162 --> 01:03:02.997
I'll probably be back
in a couple of hours."


1056
01:03:03.064 --> 01:03:04.365
"A couple hours?"

1057
01:03:10.671 --> 01:03:12.774
You can get a good one in
in two hours.


1058
01:03:13.941 --> 01:03:17.245
That's the kind of session
where you'll take all your clothes off.


1059
01:03:18.746 --> 01:03:20.481
I'll be butt-naked
in the living room like,


1060
01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:23.818
"Get these fucking toys out of my way!"

1061
01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:31.459
Disgusting. Foot on the coffee table,
just stroking it out, taking my time.


1062
01:03:33.695 --> 01:03:36.230
And I got a bowl of cereal waiting
for me right here.


1063
01:03:45.139 --> 01:03:48.609
That's when you have that privacy.
You can have a loud orgasm. I miss those.


1064
01:03:57.418 --> 01:03:58.786
You know, when a guy busts a nut,

1065
01:03:58.853 --> 01:04:01.189
right after that,
there's a window of six minutes


1066
01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:04.192
where he does the most rational thinking
he ever does.


1067
01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:05.793
That's when he's always horrified.

1068
01:04:10.131 --> 01:04:11.799
"My God, what have I done?

1069
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.636
Oh, my God, it's everywhere.

1070
01:04:18.806 --> 01:04:20.274
Baba!"

1071
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:25.913
Thank you very much, Austin, Texas.
I had a wonderful time.


1072
01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.084
Be well, be happy.
Good night, everybody. Thank you.


1073
01:04:30.151 --> 01:04:31.986
<i>Give it up one more time</i>

1074
01:04:32.053 --> 01:04:35.089
<i>for Dave Chappelle!</i>

1075
01:06:00.508 --> 01:06:01.876
<i>I'm rich, biatch!</i>
