1
00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:42.285
There on a windswept bluff, he stands
waiting. The man of your dreams.


2
00:00:42.494 --> 00:00:46.748
The man who'll love you more
than anything the rest of your life.


3
00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:51.420
You run to each other.
Your bodies, your lips...


4
00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:56.925
...they're coming closer and closer
together. Until, finally...


5
00:00:57.134 --> 00:00:59.553
...you kiss.

6
00:01:02.222 --> 00:01:04.141
Okay, go.

7
00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:06.643
Janet, like this.

8
00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:12.315
I feel weird, Bev.

9
00:01:12.774 --> 00:01:16.570
Weird? Wait till he shoves
his tongue in your mouth.


10
00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:28.874
Ann, did you get the lights
for the dining room?


11
00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:31.418
I'm looking for them, Teresa.

12
00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:33.879
Now this is Christmas, huh?

13
00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:35.714
Yes, it's beautiful.

14
00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:38.008
Have Lou look for them.

15
00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:41.178
She wants it up
before Leo and Bev get back.


16
00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:44.264
I gotta go.

17
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:49.603
Okay, Leo.

18
00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:55.400
Beverly Ann Donofrio, your father's
waiting to go buy the tree!


19
00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:57.361
I'm coming, Mom!

20
00:01:57.778 --> 00:02:00.530
Okay, so is Christmas.

21
00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:07.245
-This song's giving me a headache.
-Wait. Before you go with Pop.


22
00:02:07.537 --> 00:02:10.707
Why would a guy
put his tongue in my mouth?


23
00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:12.501
What?!

24
00:02:13.126 --> 00:02:17.381
A boy does that because
he wants you to bite it off.


25
00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.135
Go.

26
00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:25.597
Bye, Mom.

27
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:36.108
Hi.

28
00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:38.735
-You ready?
-Yeah.


29
00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:40.737
Let's go.

30
00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:46.326
-Pop, everyone's decorating the house.
-Good.


31
00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:48.036
Janet wanted to come.

32
00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:51.289
When you're in college,
it'll be her turn.


33
00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:55.127
Dreaming of warmth?
Dream with the Everly Brothers.


34
00:02:55.377 --> 00:02:59.047
-Good, that's our song!
-Great! Ready? One, two--


35
00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.451
Pop, this is it! Pull over.

36
00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:29.786
The big one, there. See?

37
00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:38.128
I'll buy that for you when I'm rich.

38
00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:41.715
-I bet you will.
-Mom and sis would like it.


39
00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:47.012
You know what you want for Christmas?

40
00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.766
You want the bike, right?

41
00:03:50.974 --> 00:03:54.269
It's the bike. But you think
it's too expensive.


42
00:03:54.478 --> 00:03:56.772
See, I know how you think.

43
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.152
Speak up. If you don't ask for
anything, it's what you get, nothing.


44
00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:06.948
Okay.

45
00:04:09.993 --> 00:04:13.288
There's this guy, Billy Schnar,
he's really cute.


46
00:04:13.497 --> 00:04:14.498
Billy Schnar?

47
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:18.960
We're the smartest in class.
You know who he likes? Guess!


48
00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.798
-Who?
-Melissa Thomas, you know her?


49
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:25.926
The one with braces and ugly red hair.

50
00:04:26.134 --> 00:04:31.223
She thought Israel was in Europe.
You know why he likes her? Guess!


51
00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:35.310
-Because she's stupid.
-No, because she's got boobs!


52
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.606
Or it looks like she does,
but she doesn't. She wears a bra...


53
00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:42.567
...which squishes her fat together...

54
00:04:42.776 --> 00:04:45.529
...and makes her look like
she has big boobs.


55
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:49.324
Pop, I'm gonna die
if I don't marry Billy Schnar.


56
00:04:49.866 --> 00:04:53.453
I'm gonna die all because
Melissa has boobs?


57
00:04:53.662 --> 00:04:56.999
That's just way too tragic,
even for Shakespeare.


58
00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:02.212
Okay, Pop, so that's why for
Christmas, I'd like a bra.


59
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.050
To enhance what I got,
which is more than Melissa.


60
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.388
-You're too young.
-Pop, you can't negotiate my boobs.


61
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.267
Too young or not, I've got them.
I'm a woman.


62
00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:19.146
-It's hard to see through my clothes.
-Quiet!


63
00:05:19.354 --> 00:05:21.565
The answer is no.

64
00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:31.867
Keep your mind on books, not boys.

65
00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:37.080
This is why therapists are wealthy:
moments like this.


66
00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:42.586
Why didn't he just get her the bra?
It's certainly cheaper than a bicycle.


67
00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.922
Parents and the damage they can do.

68
00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:48.842
Sometimes, it's endless.

69
00:05:49.843 --> 00:05:53.013
But she survived.
You know what they say:


70
00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:56.725
"That which doesn't kill you,
makes you want to die."


71
00:05:57.768 --> 00:06:01.605
If she was Southern,
she'd have turned life into a song.


72
00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:07.944
Since she's from Connecticut,
she turned it into a memoir.


73
00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:13.617
Someone wants to publish it,
but she has one last hurdle.


74
00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:16.036
She called me for help.

75
00:06:16.244 --> 00:06:19.873
That's why it's a tough day
to say I'm leaving her.


76
00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:26.505
I can always tell when she's nervous.
She wears a lot of makeup.


77
00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:30.634
And today, she's packed on
an extra layer of nervous.


78
00:06:31.593 --> 00:06:34.221
Forty minutes late.
I'm not complaining.


79
00:06:35.097 --> 00:06:37.724
-It's just so unlike you.
-Sorry.


80
00:06:37.933 --> 00:06:42.896
We went off to solve the problem.
Her problem. Mine would have to wait.


81
00:06:43.397 --> 00:06:47.150
-What happened?
-You're cold, lean into the vent.


82
00:06:49.403 --> 00:06:51.154
Sorry.

83
00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:58.036
-Thanks for driving me to Wallingford.
-Just make it fast.


84
00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:01.248
If Ray doesn't sign,
they won't publish it.


85
00:07:01.456 --> 00:07:02.708
He will.

86
00:07:02.916 --> 00:07:07.504
-I know seeing Ray is hard for you.
-Seeing Ray doesn't bother me.


87
00:07:07.796 --> 00:07:10.007
It should. And I understand.

88
00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:19.307
I won't make myself nuts.
I'll stay calm and be positive.


89
00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:21.018
Good.

90
00:07:21.643 --> 00:07:24.104
Did I show you the galleys?

91
00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:28.400
It's starting to look
like a real book.


92
00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:42.539
-Did you just put spit in my hair?
-Yeah, I'm fixing it. Sorry.


93
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:48.003
Just a little--

94
00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:50.714
Okay.

95
00:07:53.008 --> 00:07:57.971
I have a surprise for you.
I finished the dedication.


96
00:08:00.724 --> 00:08:06.271
"Of the many men who have come into my
life, there is finally one I trust.


97
00:08:07.814 --> 00:08:10.734
Jason, this book is for you."

98
00:08:16.323 --> 00:08:19.284
Don't take this the wrong way...

99
00:08:20.827 --> 00:08:23.121
...but don't dedicate the book to me.

100
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.291
Let's just leave it at that.
Just don't.


101
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.211
Fine. Fine. Great.

102
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.091
I'm sorry, it is possible I have
my own stuff going on today.


103
00:08:36.134 --> 00:08:38.469
What? What is it?

104
00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:43.892
No. It's nothing.

105
00:08:44.226 --> 00:08:48.271
I'll get over it. 
Look, don't worry.

106
00:08:50.148 --> 00:08:54.152
I'm having a bad day.
What's one bad day, right?


107
00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:58.198
One day? Are you kidding?
Let me quote myself.


108
00:09:00.075 --> 00:09:03.912
"One day can make your life.
One day can ruin your life.


109
00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:09.126
All life is, is four or five big days
that change everything."


110
00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:20.595
Sky Barrister is my dreamboat!

111
00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:24.099
Sit down, you'll hurt yourself.
Be careful.


112
00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:29.146
-Tina, you need a little more rouge.
-I have some right here.


113
00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:39.698
Hey, Bev! Tina!

114
00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:43.160
-Where you going?
-We're going to a party!


115
00:09:43.368 --> 00:09:45.120
-Can we come?
-Sorry.


116
00:09:45.537 --> 00:09:48.165
She wouldn't let us come
to some party.


117
00:09:48.332 --> 00:09:50.334
Are we invited to this party?

118
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.794
-They're Fay's friends.
-They're not.


119
00:09:53.003 --> 00:09:56.048
My parents are friends
with their parents.


120
00:09:56.256 --> 00:09:59.676
What's important is
Sky Barrister will be there.


121
00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:02.846
Sky has had his hands
in everything you got.


122
00:10:03.096 --> 00:10:07.100
And has a ton of your poems.
And does he call you once?


123
00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:10.354
No. Bev, you are truly a great person.

124
00:10:10.687 --> 00:10:14.024
But someone as conceited
as Sky won't see that.


125
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:17.110
Because all he can see is himself.

126
00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:21.907
-You know I'm right.
-It's true, Bev.


127
00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:26.495
-Let me wear that dress.
-What?


128
00:10:28.163 --> 00:10:31.750
If I look half as beautiful
as you in that dress...


129
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.211
...Sky will have to notice me.

130
00:10:34.378 --> 00:10:37.547
-You can wear my dress.
-No.


131
00:10:42.135 --> 00:10:44.262
No, Bev. It won't fit.

132
00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:47.307
-You got to let me wear that dress.
-Why?


133
00:10:47.557 --> 00:10:49.434
Because I love you.

134
00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:53.563
-Please, please, please.
-All right.


135
00:10:53.772 --> 00:10:55.190
Put the top up!

136
00:11:07.786 --> 00:11:11.623
Look at all these new cars.
Tina, park in the street.


137
00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:12.874
Come on!

138
00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:17.629
-Did you take my scarf?
-I got it. You're sitting on my purse.


139
00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:22.551
Bobby will crash with his friend.
This dress is swimming on me.


140
00:11:22.843 --> 00:11:26.638
And don't blame me
if this party's boring and no fun.


141
00:11:26.847 --> 00:11:28.849
Fun? Fun?

142
00:11:29.182 --> 00:11:32.060
Fun is what you bring with you.

143
00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:38.525
-Do I have something in my braces?
-I don't know.


144
00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:40.110
There.

145
00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:42.237
-It's out.
-Yeah.


146
00:11:44.114 --> 00:11:48.160
Who invited her to my party?
Who? Did you? Did you?


147
00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:50.078
I invited Fay.

148
00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:54.291
The noseguard points to me,
like he's gonna hurt me.


149
00:11:55.876 --> 00:11:59.296
-Quick, give me that!
-They're stuffing themselves.


150
00:11:59.463 --> 00:12:03.633
-Guess it's what Bobby likes.
-Wonder what that feels like.


151
00:12:04.384 --> 00:12:06.887
-Are they even?
-I think so.


152
00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:13.226
-You could be with any girl here.
-Of course, I know that.


153
00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:15.479
I'm just a placekicker.

154
00:12:16.063 --> 00:12:18.357
Bobby, wait. Where are we going?

155
00:12:18.565 --> 00:12:21.610
-Come here.
-What?


156
00:12:29.284 --> 00:12:31.203
Mind if I sit?

157
00:12:32.746 --> 00:12:34.331
Great.

158
00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:42.089
-Who's that sitting on Kevin?
-Some townie.


159
00:12:45.842 --> 00:12:47.928
-Who'd you come with?
-Ray Hasek.


160
00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:51.223
-Him? Where is he?
-In the bathroom.


161
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:53.308
Stay here.

162
00:13:34.933 --> 00:13:37.185
Hello, Sky.

163
00:13:42.858 --> 00:13:46.319
Tommy, why do you gotta
sneak up on people?


164
00:13:46.528 --> 00:13:48.488
You idiot. Shoot!

165
00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:51.450
Sorry, Bev. I didn't mean
to scare you.


166
00:13:51.658 --> 00:13:55.787
I'm sorry. I'm just completely
distracted at the moment.


167
00:13:55.996 --> 00:13:58.749
Don't talk right now.

168
00:14:06.798 --> 00:14:08.508
Hungry?

169
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.972
-You want some salt?
-Sure.


170
00:14:32.282 --> 00:14:35.118
I checked out F. Scott
Fitzgerald's stories--


171
00:14:35.285 --> 00:14:41.291
I'm doing something daring right now,
and I'm working up some optimism.


172
00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:44.711
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.


173
00:14:46.672 --> 00:14:50.676
-I'm just a big chicken.
-No, Bev.


174
00:14:51.385 --> 00:14:56.682
Someone once said a coward and a hero
have one thing in common: fear.


175
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.019
You may be scared,
but you're no coward.


176
00:15:01.228 --> 00:15:04.314
I come off the field,
following me are scouts...


177
00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:08.735
...from Notre Dame, Penn State,
Ohio State, all talking to me.


178
00:15:08.944 --> 00:15:13.990
So I'm like, "Alphabetical order."
So the guy from Penn State is first--


179
00:15:14.199 --> 00:15:18.829
Sky, wouldn't Notre Dame be first
if it's alphabetical order?


180
00:15:19.454 --> 00:15:21.957
-Hi, Sky.
-Hi!


181
00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:26.545
Here.

182
00:15:28.171 --> 00:15:29.673
Don't open it now.

183
00:15:30.882 --> 00:15:34.678
-Read it later when you can.
-Later when I can.


184
00:15:34.886 --> 00:15:36.346
Read it.

185
00:15:36.513 --> 00:15:39.933
"Silver buttons of night's
velvet dress unbuttoned...


186
00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:43.770
...to reveal my simple universe
and our heavenly touch."


187
00:15:43.979 --> 00:15:48.066
The last one was about her legs
trembling and heaving bosom.


188
00:15:48.275 --> 00:15:50.694
-She loves you.
-Bev!


189
00:15:51.194 --> 00:15:54.614
I like the poem, Bev! Bev!

190
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.806
-Don't open that door!
-Okay.


191
00:16:31.234 --> 00:16:33.653
Is everything all right?

192
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:44.498
Can I have a cigarette?

193
00:16:54.216 --> 00:16:56.510
You're blowing it out.

194
00:16:56.927 --> 00:17:02.432
You're blowing it out.
Don't breathe out. You do it.


195
00:17:06.853 --> 00:17:10.774
I know you. You were in the play
at the high school.


196
00:17:11.066 --> 00:17:14.569
You're Fay's friend.
You're the smart one.


197
00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:17.739
I'm Ray Hasek.

198
00:17:17.948 --> 00:17:19.449
Bobby's friend.

199
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.454
Fay made us go because she painted
all the background stuff. Remember?


200
00:17:24.705 --> 00:17:27.541
-You were the girl.
-Juliet.


201
00:17:27.749 --> 00:17:29.042
Yeah!

202
00:17:31.253 --> 00:17:32.796
You were beautiful.

203
00:17:33.588 --> 00:17:37.884
I told Bobby, "You watch,
that girl's gonna be something."


204
00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:42.973
-That's what I said.
-I write my own stuff too.


205
00:17:45.225 --> 00:17:49.271
-And I'm probably gonna go to NYU.
-I'm sorry.


206
00:17:50.689 --> 00:17:54.526
But no, that's good. Wow.

207
00:17:58.321 --> 00:18:04.286
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but why are you crying?


208
00:18:05.329 --> 00:18:07.289
Because of this guy.

209
00:18:07.497 --> 00:18:11.752
He said very personal stuff about me
in front of everyone.


210
00:18:12.252 --> 00:18:17.007
But the poem was good.
I think it'll hit him on the way home.


211
00:18:17.215 --> 00:18:19.968
Wait. Who is this guy?

212
00:18:24.264 --> 00:18:25.599
Sky Barrister.

213
00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:30.687
Oh, yeah. I know that asshole.

214
00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:34.524
I'll go tell him not
to say stuff about you.


215
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:38.695
He's very handsome,
so don't hit him in the face.


216
00:18:44.284 --> 00:18:46.453
What is she still doing here?

217
00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:49.206
She's blond, 26.

218
00:18:49.456 --> 00:18:52.876
And who's that? 
I didn't invite him.

219
00:18:58.507 --> 00:19:01.051
-Hey, Sky.
-What's going on?


220
00:19:01.426 --> 00:19:03.303
Hit me. Right here.

221
00:19:05.305 --> 00:19:08.183
No, man! Hit me right here!

222
00:19:10.143 --> 00:19:12.562
No! Come on, hit me!

223
00:19:14.648 --> 00:19:17.401
-My hand!
-Sky!


224
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:24.199
-See? He came in, I went down.
-It's broken!


225
00:19:24.408 --> 00:19:28.245
-There goes the season!
-Come on. Come on!


226
00:19:28.453 --> 00:19:30.205
Let's get him!

227
00:19:30.414 --> 00:19:32.916
-Thanks, Tommy.
-See you Monday, Bev.


228
00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:36.044
-Out of the way, Tommy!
-Go, go, go!


229
00:19:37.754 --> 00:19:39.047
Get in the car!

230
00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:42.676
-Let's go!
-Get in the car!


231
00:19:42.884 --> 00:19:45.429
-I go down and--
-Get in the car!


232
00:19:45.762 --> 00:19:49.182
-We forgot Tina!
-She's got her own car.


233
00:19:49.391 --> 00:19:52.436
Tommy's car's blocking the way.
Go, Bobby!


234
00:19:55.188 --> 00:19:58.567
-Bev, can you hop in front, please?
-All right.


235
00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:01.737
This is Bobby's and my favorite spot.

236
00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:05.741
Ray, take her. 
Come here, you.

237
00:20:05.949 --> 00:20:09.036
-Bev, get in front with Ray.
-I'm going.


238
00:20:09.244 --> 00:20:11.288
Come here, sweetie.

239
00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:17.044
Come on, babe. You know
I'm heading out to basic. Please!


240
00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.797
God, I'm gonna miss you so much.

241
00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:23.550
Thanks.

242
00:20:34.436 --> 00:20:37.481
Thanks for doing that
for me back there.


243
00:20:38.857 --> 00:20:40.942
-Does your head hurt?
-No.


244
00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:46.448
My father always said
that my head was like a rock.


245
00:20:46.656 --> 00:20:49.284
He broke his hand twice on it.

246
00:20:49.493 --> 00:20:53.497
What's in your chest?
What is this?


247
00:20:55.248 --> 00:20:58.960
-It's Bev's dress. It's too big.
-Oh, sweetie.


248
00:20:59.169 --> 00:21:01.505
It didn't look right on me.

249
00:21:01.672 --> 00:21:05.676
-How come I never see you in school?
-I don't go.


250
00:21:08.136 --> 00:21:11.306
-Don't your parents care?
-There's a lot of it!


251
00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:13.266
My...

252
00:21:13.725 --> 00:21:17.854
...pop, he got drunk and died fishing.

253
00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:22.275
And Ma, she doesn't want me
hanging around my sister.


254
00:21:22.484 --> 00:21:25.195
She thinks I'm bad like my brother.

255
00:21:26.488 --> 00:21:29.533
So you're all alone.
You don't have anybody.


256
00:21:32.744 --> 00:21:35.998
Well, there's Lizzard, he's a friend.

257
00:21:36.206 --> 00:21:39.042
And I got Bobby. 
He's like family.

258
00:21:39.376 --> 00:21:42.462
-What you doing?
-Spelling my name in hickies.


259
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:44.172
Just your first name.

260
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:47.050
-Let's get you home.
-Stop!


261
00:21:47.342 --> 00:21:50.053
-Oh, my knee!
-Are you okay?


262
00:21:50.262 --> 00:21:52.389
I don't wanna go home yet.

263
00:21:53.056 --> 00:21:54.725
But, I....

264
00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:02.524
Listen. Don't.

265
00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:07.738
Beverly, listen. You shouldn't get
mixed up with me. I'm no good.


266
00:22:09.156 --> 00:22:11.616
You were good to me.

267
00:22:16.163 --> 00:22:21.293
Open your eyes.
Don't take them off of me.


268
00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:27.382
Cool.

269
00:22:31.345 --> 00:22:35.474
Don't. What are you doing?

270
00:22:36.558 --> 00:22:40.604
-You better stop laughing.
-Leave me alone, Fay.


271
00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.859
God bless you.

272
00:22:46.068 --> 00:22:48.612
What is that?

273
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.948
What the heck is this?

274
00:22:53.784 --> 00:22:57.913
-Bev, stop laughing. Give me my shoes.
-Ray. Ray!


275
00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:01.375
-It's her father.
-I'm looking. I found one.


276
00:23:01.583 --> 00:23:02.876
It's your father!

277
00:23:03.085 --> 00:23:07.422
-Pete, we're taking them in.
-What?!


278
00:23:07.714 --> 00:23:08.882
Sorry, Daddy.

279
00:23:09.091 --> 00:23:11.176
What happened to your dress?

280
00:23:11.385 --> 00:23:14.846
-You won't see that girl again.
-You can't be trusted.


281
00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:17.891
What? Are you chewing?
Say it again.


282
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.060
I'll call you back.

283
00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:23.814
Look at you. For God's sake,
button your blouse.


284
00:23:28.151 --> 00:23:32.364
-What happened to you?
-Nothing. I'm still the same.


285
00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:36.034
You know that guy's brother got
sent up for robbery?


286
00:23:36.243 --> 00:23:40.330
Yes, but he's doing well in prison.
He's learning a trade.


287
00:23:41.957 --> 00:23:44.584
All we were doing was making out.

288
00:23:45.627 --> 00:23:48.714
I just met him.
I'd never go past second base.


289
00:23:48.922 --> 00:23:53.051
Which means nothing below the waist.
My waist, not his.


290
00:23:59.349 --> 00:24:02.519
You're home. Get out.

291
00:24:06.148 --> 00:24:09.443
Pop, I swear, nothing happened.

292
00:24:29.212 --> 00:24:32.841
Look at that guy. He's so hot!

293
00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:41.058
-Wait.
-No.


294
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.356
I had to run out. Jason, if it's you,
say something great.


295
00:24:47.898 --> 00:24:49.024
It's me.

296
00:24:51.902 --> 00:24:54.821
The last two weeks
have changed my life.


297
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.950
I'm not involved with her.
I had to do this just one day.


298
00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:02.204
I'm gonna tell her
about us this morning.


299
00:25:02.412 --> 00:25:06.833
This afternoon, tops. I swear I'll
be back by 6:00 tonight...


300
00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:09.503
...and you and I are on that plane.

301
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:14.091
And, okay, here goes. Amelia...

302
00:25:18.762 --> 00:25:20.931
...I love you.

303
00:25:24.935 --> 00:25:28.605
That girlfriend of yours
sure likes that horn.


304
00:25:28.814 --> 00:25:31.108
She's not my girlfriend.

305
00:25:33.902 --> 00:25:37.614
-She's my mother.
-Your mother?


306
00:25:39.616 --> 00:25:42.369
Kill me, Fay,
because I want to die!


307
00:25:42.577 --> 00:25:46.748
I want to be dead!
That's not too much to ask for.


308
00:25:46.957 --> 00:25:50.752
How will I tell my parents?
We can't talk about anything.


309
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:54.923
How am I supposed to tell them
I committed a mortal sin?!


310
00:25:55.132 --> 00:25:58.135
Okay! I know, I understand.

311
00:25:58.301 --> 00:26:00.887
Calm down. We'll practice.

312
00:26:01.096 --> 00:26:06.727
Pretend I'm your parents. Say what
you'll say. You'll get through it.


313
00:26:06.935 --> 00:26:09.646
Tell me like you would tell them.

314
00:26:13.316 --> 00:26:16.778
-Mom. Pop.
-Yeah?


315
00:26:19.948 --> 00:26:23.994
-I don't know how to tell you this.
-But...?


316
00:26:25.287 --> 00:26:28.999
-I'm pregnant.
-My daughter's a tramp.


317
00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:33.754
My daughter is a tramp!
My daughter's a tramp!


318
00:26:33.962 --> 00:26:37.174
You're 15 years old!
How could you do this?


319
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:40.927
You make me sick to my stomach!
Just take my gun!


320
00:26:41.136 --> 00:26:46.975
Take my gun and shoot me in the head,
tramp! I wish you were never born!


321
00:26:47.934 --> 00:26:49.895
Okay, go.

322
00:26:54.191 --> 00:26:56.318
You can do it.

323
00:26:59.363 --> 00:27:03.617
-Maybe you should tell Ray first.
-Okay.


324
00:27:05.994 --> 00:27:10.332
In Puerto Rico you can get rid of it,
but I don't have any money.


325
00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.710
-Do you have any money?
-No.


326
00:27:17.172 --> 00:27:18.632
That's it, then.

327
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.802
I have to throw myself
at my parents' mercy.


328
00:27:22.803 --> 00:27:27.516
If they help me take care of the baby,
I can get a job and save money.


329
00:27:27.724 --> 00:27:29.393
That'd be good.

330
00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:33.313
Then I could move to New York,
get a job at a newspaper.


331
00:27:33.522 --> 00:27:37.859
-Nothing big, something small.
-I can't. Wait! New York?


332
00:27:38.402 --> 00:27:39.820
Bev...

333
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.156
-...what about me?
-What about you?


334
00:27:44.074 --> 00:27:45.867
Well...

335
00:27:47.744 --> 00:27:50.330
...I love you. A lot.

336
00:27:50.998 --> 00:27:52.708
What, Bev?

337
00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:55.168
What are you talking about?!

338
00:27:56.044 --> 00:27:58.380
What?

339
00:27:59.089 --> 00:28:03.301
-Why is this happening to me?
-Bev, I'm sorry. Come on.


340
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.680
My life is over! 
I might as well jump!

341
00:28:06.888 --> 00:28:09.182
What are you doing? Come on.

342
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:12.269
We've been going out. I mean...

343
00:28:12.602 --> 00:28:14.604
...do you love me?

344
00:28:17.858 --> 00:28:21.945
-It was summer.
-Yeah, but do--?


345
00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:25.699
You're not the guy
I'm supposed to end up with.


346
00:28:27.784 --> 00:28:29.911
It would derail my life.

347
00:28:30.454 --> 00:28:33.290
Bev, look at me. Bev!

348
00:28:33.457 --> 00:28:35.876
Okay, look. Maybe...

349
00:28:36.752 --> 00:28:41.840
...you're not supposed to end up with
me. But I'll make you happy. I swear.


350
00:28:42.591 --> 00:28:47.262
If you married me,
I would cherish you...


351
00:28:47.471 --> 00:28:50.974
...for all the time, till death.
Till I die.


352
00:28:51.141 --> 00:28:53.226
Till death. For the--

353
00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:57.314
I may not be the perfect guy
in a lot of ways...


354
00:28:57.647 --> 00:29:01.985
...but I'm the right guy
because nobody will love you like me.


355
00:29:08.867 --> 00:29:14.331
Please marry me.
Because I'm shit without you.


356
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.627
How romantic.

357
00:29:18.835 --> 00:29:22.923
A marriage proposal
that contains the word "shit."


358
00:29:23.382 --> 00:29:25.467
Sorry.

359
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:29.054
Okay, just hold on, Fay.
Janet, door.


360
00:29:29.262 --> 00:29:31.473
Can you believe he did that?

361
00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:37.479
I swear, I would rather die than marry
Ray. I don't care what my father says.


362
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.774
Bev...

363
00:29:40.982 --> 00:29:44.653
...I know this sounds horrible...

364
00:29:45.153 --> 00:29:50.117
...but my aunt fell down the stairs
when she was preg-- You know.


365
00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:52.661
And she...

366
00:29:52.869 --> 00:29:54.997
...you know.

367
00:29:55.205 --> 00:29:59.042
And I thought maybe you could--
You know?


368
00:29:59.751 --> 00:30:01.670
Good night, Fay.

369
00:30:03.672 --> 00:30:05.590
Janet?

370
00:30:09.177 --> 00:30:13.724
I'll give you five bucks
if you throw me down the stairs.


371
00:30:15.058 --> 00:30:16.685
No!

372
00:30:17.144 --> 00:30:20.480
Janet? You'd better be asleep!

373
00:30:58.852 --> 00:31:00.187
What was that?

374
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.189
What are they doing?

375
00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:03.774
I don't know.

376
00:31:04.024 --> 00:31:06.401
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.


377
00:31:18.372 --> 00:31:20.248
Dear Mom and Pop:

378
00:31:20.707 --> 00:31:24.878
The prospect of you reading this
so shatters me that...


379
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.255
...I'm a stranger to myself.

380
00:31:28.757 --> 00:31:33.679
Your fears over my behavior,
which I thought unreasonable...


381
00:31:34.054 --> 00:31:36.765
...seem now the stuff of wisdom.

382
00:31:37.057 --> 00:31:41.311
I have terrible news
I've been withholding from you.


383
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.940
But, like poison
from an adder's tongue...


384
00:31:45.607 --> 00:31:47.609
...I have to spit it out.

385
00:31:50.237 --> 00:31:52.072
I am pregnant.

386
00:31:52.447 --> 00:31:55.283
Wow. That's really good writing.

387
00:31:56.243 --> 00:31:58.120
-Yeah?
-Yeah.


388
00:31:59.496 --> 00:32:01.456
There's more.

389
00:32:02.624 --> 00:32:07.421
Perhaps after the anger,
which you have every right to feel...


390
00:32:07.963 --> 00:32:11.842
...you will remember
I am the daughter you loved.


391
00:32:12.134 --> 00:32:13.677
Beverly.

392
00:32:17.764 --> 00:32:22.519
This is what we'll do. She'll go
to school until she starts to show.


393
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.647
Then she'll get
her equivalency.


394
00:32:26.023 --> 00:32:28.525
Then she'll get
a job as a secretary.


395
00:32:29.026 --> 00:32:33.321
After they're married,
they'll move into the rec room. Right?


396
00:32:33.864 --> 00:32:36.825
That's not the plan
I have in mind.


397
00:32:39.703 --> 00:32:42.706
I've decided what's best
for my future...


398
00:32:43.373 --> 00:32:45.834
...is not getting married.

399
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.881
As you can see from my letter,
I have a flair for writing.


400
00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.009
-So my plan is--
-Plan?


401
00:32:54.843 --> 00:32:56.011
You have a plan?

402
00:32:58.055 --> 00:32:59.639
You have a plan.

403
00:33:00.223 --> 00:33:02.225
Well, I had a plan too.

404
00:33:03.727 --> 00:33:07.898
I was gonna work hard,
raise a good family...


405
00:33:08.565 --> 00:33:10.567
...hold my head up proud.

406
00:33:11.902 --> 00:33:13.236
That plan's dead.

407
00:33:15.906 --> 00:33:17.366
Know what I thought?

408
00:33:18.742 --> 00:33:20.702
No. No, I better not.

409
00:33:24.414 --> 00:33:28.919
Go ahead.
Say whatever you want.


410
00:33:33.674 --> 00:33:35.258
You were special.

411
00:33:37.219 --> 00:33:39.096
And you ruined your life.

412
00:33:41.223 --> 00:33:42.766
And you broke my heart.

413
00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:55.278
I just....

414
00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:57.280
Say something.

415
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.582
Leo, it'll be okay.

416
00:34:07.958 --> 00:34:09.876
Don't cry, Pop. Please.

417
00:34:10.585 --> 00:34:14.131
Mom's right.
Everything will be okay.


418
00:34:15.464 --> 00:34:17.466
We're gonna get married...

419
00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:20.428
...because we're in love...

420
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.266
...and we're gonna get married.

421
00:34:29.229 --> 00:34:30.731
Excuse me!

422
00:34:31.272 --> 00:34:34.026
-You're late.
-You know my parents.


423
00:34:34.234 --> 00:34:35.944
I had to sneak out.

424
00:34:36.153 --> 00:34:37.612
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.


425
00:34:37.988 --> 00:34:41.825
-What's the shoe polish for?
-Decorating the car, silly.


426
00:34:43.201 --> 00:34:46.330
I got her some Green Stamps.
I hope it's okay.


427
00:34:46.495 --> 00:34:48.332
Please, stand still.

428
00:34:48.665 --> 00:34:50.000
-Sexy.
-Stop it.


429
00:34:50.207 --> 00:34:51.460
Stop hitting her.

430
00:34:52.002 --> 00:34:54.338
-Come on. I can't get it.
-Please!


431
00:34:55.004 --> 00:34:57.924
-Stop moving around. You ready?
-Stop!


432
00:34:58.133 --> 00:34:59.801
All right? Do I got it?

433
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.847
-Take the picture!
-Don't yell in front of the church!


434
00:35:04.139 --> 00:35:06.350
Take the picture, will you?!

435
00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.353
-Everybody stand still.
-My baby.


436
00:35:10.687 --> 00:35:12.314
That was a good one.

437
00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:15.025
-Can I have some more?
-Yeah.


438
00:35:22.032 --> 00:35:25.952
-Can we get some more wine, please?
-Don't!


439
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.708
Sorry.

440
00:35:31.875 --> 00:35:34.378
Okay, this is for Bobby.

441
00:35:53.897 --> 00:35:55.899
-Say something.
-I got it.


442
00:36:00.779 --> 00:36:03.240
-This is a wedding.
-Let her finish!


443
00:36:03.532 --> 00:36:04.908
Thank you. I'm sorry.

444
00:36:05.117 --> 00:36:07.244
Save it for the Vietnamese.

445
00:36:07.452 --> 00:36:10.998
-I love you, Bobby.
-I love you too.


446
00:36:17.796 --> 00:36:20.924
When I get back,
we're starting our own garage.


447
00:36:21.133 --> 00:36:25.178
Cars, bikes,
I'm thinking maybe even trucks.


448
00:36:25.387 --> 00:36:26.763
-Yeah?
-Yeah!


449
00:36:29.433 --> 00:36:32.519
That's great!
Because between you and me...


450
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:38.108
...I had no idea
how I was gonna make a living.


451
00:36:39.317 --> 00:36:42.112
-Lovely affair.
-Thanks. They need it.


452
00:36:42.446 --> 00:36:44.781
No, give it to Teresa.

453
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.452
-She can't hear.
-To Teresa! I'll keep it.


454
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.287
-No!
-Give me that!


455
00:36:55.459 --> 00:36:58.795
Thank you.
I really like the macaroni salad.


456
00:37:05.802 --> 00:37:07.304
Watch this. Go!

457
00:37:09.306 --> 00:37:11.099
Bev, look at Tina.

458
00:37:11.475 --> 00:37:12.726
And Kevin.

459
00:37:21.443 --> 00:37:23.070
She loves to dance.

460
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.325
Beautiful.

461
00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:32.704
Janet, you were great.

462
00:37:33.997 --> 00:37:36.583
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Tony.


463
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.338
Thank you. We're going to take
an intermission to eat.


464
00:37:41.672 --> 00:37:45.008
We'll be back. 
Thank you very much.

465
00:37:47.678 --> 00:37:50.097
You should have danced.

466
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:54.267
What's the matter?

467
00:37:55.018 --> 00:37:56.478
What?

468
00:37:56.687 --> 00:37:59.981
My father never asked me to dance.

469
00:38:00.357 --> 00:38:03.527
He's embarrassed to be seen with me.

470
00:38:04.236 --> 00:38:05.612
You're crazy.

471
00:38:06.363 --> 00:38:08.824
Nobody's ashamed
to be seen with you.


472
00:38:09.032 --> 00:38:11.994
How come no one's come to say hi?

473
00:38:12.202 --> 00:38:16.039
I'm the bride. The only person
to even look at me...


474
00:38:16.206 --> 00:38:21.003
...is crazy Aunt Mildy, who's
calling me Agnes, my dead cousin.


475
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:23.213
-Agnes!
-Hi, Mildy.


476
00:38:24.506 --> 00:38:26.008
-Know what?
-I love you!


477
00:38:26.383 --> 00:38:29.344
Who cares about them? Right?

478
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.265
No, I know what's gonna happen.

479
00:38:33.557 --> 00:38:38.562
When you graduate, you'll get sent
to a fancy school. I'll be alone.


480
00:38:40.731 --> 00:38:42.733
With a kid.

481
00:38:42.899 --> 00:38:45.318
-Let's hear a speech.
-Good idea!


482
00:38:45.527 --> 00:38:48.405
-Speech! Speech!
-Tony, drum roll.


483
00:38:48.572 --> 00:38:50.073
All right!

484
00:38:58.749 --> 00:39:03.420
There are times in a man's life
when there is cause to celebrate.


485
00:39:04.296 --> 00:39:07.924
-See?
-And finding friends is easy.


486
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.387
But then there are times like this.

487
00:39:12.596 --> 00:39:17.267
And if people are still there,
those are his real friends.


488
00:39:18.602 --> 00:39:20.479
His real family.

489
00:39:22.105 --> 00:39:24.900
We all know what brought us here.

490
00:39:25.776 --> 00:39:30.322
And the fact you still
saw it in your hearts to come....


491
00:39:34.284 --> 00:39:35.827
Well, you're in my...

492
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:40.123
...my heart forever.

493
00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:45.671
-Salud.
-Salud!


494
00:39:47.631 --> 00:39:51.510
Now you can go back and eat.
And finish eating.


495
00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:57.641
-Wasn't that nice?
-Beautiful!


496
00:39:58.016 --> 00:40:00.310
-Beautiful!
-Thanks. Sit down.


497
00:40:04.147 --> 00:40:06.733
She's not gonna sing again, is she?

498
00:40:09.653 --> 00:40:11.154
Hi.

499
00:40:11.822 --> 00:40:14.116
My name is Fay.

500
00:40:14.908 --> 00:40:17.452
And I'm Bev's best friend.

501
00:40:19.496 --> 00:40:21.748
I just wanted to say...

502
00:40:22.416 --> 00:40:25.460
...how beautiful Bev looks tonight.

503
00:40:25.669 --> 00:40:28.797
And to wish her
all the happiness in the world.


504
00:40:29.673 --> 00:40:34.428
Now that I've said it,
maybe one of you could say it too.


505
00:40:37.097 --> 00:40:42.436
Sitting over there is a girl who
has a light around her.


506
00:40:42.686 --> 00:40:44.021
It's the chair.

507
00:40:44.229 --> 00:40:48.233
When you're near her,
something exciting will happen.


508
00:40:48.692 --> 00:40:52.529
If you think you deserve a medal
for being here...


509
00:40:52.696 --> 00:40:54.656
...due to the circumstances--

510
00:40:54.865 --> 00:40:58.702
-That's enough--
-No. Wait, I'm not finished yet.


511
00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:04.207
If you're so great for being here,
don't talk to me, either.


512
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.501
Okay?

513
00:41:10.464 --> 00:41:12.466
Because I'm pregnant too.

514
00:41:16.053 --> 00:41:17.512
She's what?

515
00:41:17.721 --> 00:41:19.389
-Congratulations.
-Really?


516
00:41:19.848 --> 00:41:21.850
-Did you know?
-No.


517
00:41:22.559 --> 00:41:24.186
It's an epidemic.

518
00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:26.021
Go back to eating now.

519
00:41:26.563 --> 00:41:28.065
Salud.

520
00:41:28.273 --> 00:41:30.984
-Tony!
-Come on, put the food down.


521
00:41:33.904 --> 00:41:38.033
Zippy, ask your cousin to dance.
Janet, dance with Zippy.


522
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:40.077
I don't know what to say.

523
00:41:41.745 --> 00:41:44.247
-Swear you're not joking.
-I swear.


524
00:41:44.581 --> 00:41:46.583
I found out two days ago.

525
00:41:47.209 --> 00:41:49.586
I had to tell Bobby first.
Sorry.


526
00:41:49.795 --> 00:41:53.298
-It's okay.
-It's not. There's no ceremony.


527
00:41:53.507 --> 00:41:56.426
We're getting married
before he ships out.


528
00:41:56.593 --> 00:42:00.263
My father wanted me
to live with my brother...


529
00:42:00.472 --> 00:42:04.601
...and put the baby up for adoption,
but Mom said no.


530
00:42:04.768 --> 00:42:06.812
That's what's going on.

531
00:42:09.064 --> 00:42:11.692
We're gonna be pregnant together!

532
00:42:13.443 --> 00:42:16.113
And we're both gonna have girls!

533
00:42:18.281 --> 00:42:21.368
And they're gonna be just like us!

534
00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.546
She's crazy.

535
00:42:35.841 --> 00:42:37.801
-Keep them closed!
-All right.


536
00:42:38.093 --> 00:42:40.595
-Where are we? Fay?
-No peeking.


537
00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:43.306
-I'm right here.
-You coming?


538
00:42:43.598 --> 00:42:47.144
You want to come in? Bobby!

539
00:42:47.644 --> 00:42:49.146
Fay Forrester!

540
00:42:49.604 --> 00:42:51.440
I'll write from Vietnam!

541
00:42:51.648 --> 00:42:54.651
They had to leave.
Keep going.


542
00:42:54.985 --> 00:42:57.821
Keep them closed.

543
00:42:57.988 --> 00:43:01.158
-Keep them closed.
-What are you doing?


544
00:43:01.825 --> 00:43:03.493
Bend the knee.

545
00:43:04.953 --> 00:43:07.664
-My God. All right.
-Okay.


546
00:43:08.665 --> 00:43:10.834
Keep them closed.
All right.


547
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:13.003
-I'm caught.
-It's all right.


548
00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:17.466
-Where are we going?
-Don't open them until I say.


549
00:43:17.841 --> 00:43:19.551
Okay!

550
00:43:21.345 --> 00:43:23.347
Okay, open your eyes!

551
00:43:24.848 --> 00:43:27.017
Open your eyes, come on.

552
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.527
-What is it?
-What is it?


553
00:43:37.694 --> 00:43:41.698
This is our place!
This is where we're gonna live!


554
00:43:41.907 --> 00:43:44.743
-How'd you do this?
-I talked to your father.


555
00:43:44.951 --> 00:43:47.663
He got us public housing.

556
00:43:47.871 --> 00:43:49.331
He helped you?

557
00:43:50.374 --> 00:43:54.836
Us. I think he was glad
that I came to him.


558
00:43:55.045 --> 00:43:59.549
I figured you didn't want
to be under their rules anymore.


559
00:43:59.716 --> 00:44:02.678
Look. This is a great stove. Really.

560
00:44:02.886 --> 00:44:06.932
It goes all the way to 550.
That's like lava. Hot.


561
00:44:08.392 --> 00:44:10.435
Close your eyes.

562
00:44:12.229 --> 00:44:13.730
Okay.

563
00:44:14.731 --> 00:44:20.070
Very few people in my life
have treated me as good as you do.


564
00:44:20.237 --> 00:44:23.073
That has to mean
something good, right?


565
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.075
I don't know.

566
00:44:27.244 --> 00:44:32.624
Tonight I have an amazing feeling,
like everything's gonna be okay.


567
00:44:34.418 --> 00:44:36.294
And...

568
00:44:40.424 --> 00:44:42.342
...I'm done.

569
00:44:48.932 --> 00:44:52.102
Our own home.

570
00:44:52.269 --> 00:44:56.898
-Ray, this is going to be so much fun!
-It's good, huh?


571
00:44:57.107 --> 00:45:01.611
My God! I can't believe it!
No parents! Our own house!


572
00:45:02.738 --> 00:45:06.283
Last night, I fought Ray
for the last chicken piece.


573
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.619
I said, "If you don't let go,
I'll kill you!"


574
00:45:09.828 --> 00:45:12.622
I'm starting to scare myself, Fay.

575
00:45:12.831 --> 00:45:16.251
It's good Bobby's away
because I get all the food.


576
00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:21.298
No fights. It's a better marriage
because of it. You okay?


577
00:45:21.798 --> 00:45:23.633
She's kicking.

578
00:45:24.134 --> 00:45:25.761
Mine too.

579
00:45:25.969 --> 00:45:28.305
Let's let them play together.

580
00:45:32.476 --> 00:45:34.811
Beverly! Fay!

581
00:45:35.103 --> 00:45:36.730
-Hi, Tina.
-Tina!


582
00:45:37.314 --> 00:45:39.858
We're on our way to junior prom.

583
00:45:40.317 --> 00:45:42.444
I'll tell you all about it.

584
00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:45.072
-Bye, girls!
-You got really big.


585
00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:48.200
That was genuinely insensitive!

586
00:45:50.661 --> 00:45:54.164
It's hot, I know.
I'm doing the floor.


587
00:45:57.834 --> 00:46:02.255
Where is he? He was supposed to
be here three hours ago.


588
00:46:02.714 --> 00:46:08.053
-I missed my appointment.
-What'll they say that's new?


589
00:46:09.179 --> 00:46:13.725
I'm two weeks late.
Why won't this thing come out?!


590
00:46:14.059 --> 00:46:16.687
That "thing" is very smart.

591
00:46:16.937 --> 00:46:19.731
It's not coming out
until you're ready.


592
00:46:21.066 --> 00:46:23.777
What are you doing?
You're making a mess.


593
00:46:30.742 --> 00:46:32.577
Pull. Pull.

594
00:46:35.205 --> 00:46:37.416
I'll clean it up.

595
00:46:38.208 --> 00:46:41.878
-You're three hours late!
-I'm sorry.


596
00:46:42.212 --> 00:46:43.714
-You're drunk.
-No.


597
00:46:43.964 --> 00:46:48.385
-You were with Lizzard!
-No! My boss.


598
00:46:50.137 --> 00:46:51.471
Bev, come on.

599
00:46:51.722 --> 00:46:53.098
Bev.

600
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:55.058
What are you doing?

601
00:46:55.225 --> 00:46:56.768
I'm locking him out!

602
00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:00.981
Come on!
Open up or else I'll--


603
00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:04.818
What? Break it down?
You'll break your neck.


604
00:47:05.068 --> 00:47:06.570
Enough of this.

605
00:47:06.903 --> 00:47:09.948
-Where are you going?
-I'm not staying.


606
00:47:13.118 --> 00:47:16.621
I didn't break my neck.
Hi, Ma.


607
00:47:16.913 --> 00:47:18.665
-Hi, Raymond.
-You idiot!


608
00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:23.253
We can't afford a crib,
and you broke the window!


609
00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.757
What am I supposed to do?
Tell my boss that--


610
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.759
Oh, Raymond.

611
00:47:29.092 --> 00:47:31.261
You're bleeding.

612
00:47:31.803 --> 00:47:33.096
I'm bleeding!

613
00:47:34.348 --> 00:47:38.101
You're getting it on the floor.
And on the wall!


614
00:47:38.352 --> 00:47:40.354
-Stop bleeding!
-I'm trying!


615
00:47:40.645 --> 00:47:43.273
-Stop bleeding!
-Shut up.


616
00:47:43.607 --> 00:47:46.276
Start moving.
Come on!


617
00:47:46.485 --> 00:47:50.781
Get some peroxide and toilet paper.
Hurry up!


618
00:47:51.031 --> 00:47:53.450
-Is there glass in there?
-No!


619
00:47:53.658 --> 00:47:56.953
Waddle quicker!
He's bleeding to death!


620
00:47:57.329 --> 00:47:58.955
Hold it tight.

621
00:48:01.166 --> 00:48:03.669
It was my boss.
I had to go.


622
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.796
Raymond?
Look at me.


623
00:48:06.296 --> 00:48:09.132
You're the man of this house.

624
00:48:09.383 --> 00:48:14.513
Bring home the bacon.
If you say you'll be here, be here!


625
00:48:14.721 --> 00:48:16.973
-No lying, no drinking!
-Mom!


626
00:48:17.182 --> 00:48:19.559
-What?
-Help!


627
00:48:19.768 --> 00:48:21.520
Help! Come on!

628
00:48:23.563 --> 00:48:24.564
What?

629
00:48:26.858 --> 00:48:28.819
What's happening?

630
00:48:31.822 --> 00:48:33.323
Oh, Bev.

631
00:48:34.366 --> 00:48:37.828
-Your water broke.
-What?


632
00:48:38.996 --> 00:48:41.832
Is that supposed to happen?

633
00:48:42.749 --> 00:48:46.670
-I'm so excited.
-This is so gross.


634
00:48:56.096 --> 00:49:00.058
Hello, beautiful.
Hello, beautiful baby.


635
00:49:00.392 --> 00:49:04.438
Is this the most
beautiful baby you've ever seen?


636
00:49:05.188 --> 00:49:09.526
I'm serious. Is this
the most beautiful baby you've seen?


637
00:49:09.901 --> 00:49:12.738
Well, to be honest, yeah.

638
00:49:13.572 --> 00:49:17.075
Let's go see Bev.
She wants to see you.


639
00:49:17.409 --> 00:49:19.369
Come on, it'll be fun.

640
00:49:20.037 --> 00:49:24.624
Mommy's 15, Daddy's a moron,
and they want us to celebrate.


641
00:49:24.916 --> 00:49:26.251
We know better.

642
00:49:26.543 --> 00:49:29.129
I'll be back later.
Come on, Leo.


643
00:49:29.379 --> 00:49:32.257
For the record,
I'm on your side.


644
00:49:47.731 --> 00:49:50.442
Mr. and Mrs. Hasek,
I have your baby.


645
00:49:50.776 --> 00:49:53.570
Hey, can you wait one second?

646
00:49:56.156 --> 00:49:57.449
Hey, Bev.

647
00:50:01.161 --> 00:50:03.747
I'm sorry I broke your water.

648
00:50:04.247 --> 00:50:07.626
Nothing like that
will ever happen again.


649
00:50:07.959 --> 00:50:12.422
No more drinking.
No more forgetting.


650
00:50:12.798 --> 00:50:15.759
I'm gonna be good, okay?

651
00:50:17.427 --> 00:50:20.013
I love you so much.

652
00:50:35.612 --> 00:50:40.158
This is one of the most beautiful
baby boys I've ever seen.


653
00:50:40.492 --> 00:50:43.286
I didn't have a boy,
I had a girl.


654
00:50:43.453 --> 00:50:46.790
No, we had a boy.
Don't you remember?


655
00:50:49.459 --> 00:50:52.004
I told Fay we'd both have girls...

656
00:50:52.212 --> 00:50:55.215
...and they'd be just like us.

657
00:50:55.674 --> 00:50:58.135
No, we had a boy.

658
00:50:58.468 --> 00:51:02.139
He's going to grow up
and be just like me.


659
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.685
Try feeding him for a little while.

660
00:51:06.977 --> 00:51:10.188
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

661
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:13.859
I'll try.

662
00:51:20.323 --> 00:51:22.034
It's a boy.

663
00:51:24.661 --> 00:51:28.332
-It sure is.
-It's a boy.


664
00:51:32.002 --> 00:51:33.837
No!

665
00:51:39.718 --> 00:51:43.096
Hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium....


666
00:51:43.305 --> 00:51:46.350
We're gonna get a good one.
Ready?


667
00:51:46.683 --> 00:51:49.227
Hold that! Ready?
Click.


668
00:51:49.728 --> 00:51:53.523
Jason and Amelia,
sitting in a tree...


669
00:51:54.399 --> 00:51:58.195
...while Bev is getting
her high school degree.


670
00:52:06.286 --> 00:52:08.080
I'm trying to study.

671
00:52:08.705 --> 00:52:12.209
Ten more minutes.
Be quiet for a minute.


672
00:52:12.542 --> 00:52:14.086
Jason, God!

673
00:52:14.461 --> 00:52:16.380
Can't he hit the bowl?

674
00:52:21.551 --> 00:52:23.428
You're distracting me.

675
00:52:24.763 --> 00:52:26.056
Ma!

676
00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:30.894
-What?
-Jason won't leave me alone!


677
00:52:31.228 --> 00:52:33.271
You're his mother.

678
00:52:33.772 --> 00:52:38.276
I got four weeks to study
for the SAT, for the scholarship.


679
00:52:38.944 --> 00:52:42.406
I know you're smart,
and you have dreams.


680
00:52:42.656 --> 00:52:44.408
But you need a job.

681
00:52:44.574 --> 00:52:47.494
This one pays for living expenses.

682
00:52:50.288 --> 00:52:54.292
I told you to change his diaper
an hour ago.


683
00:52:54.918 --> 00:52:57.087
He loves when you do it.

684
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.841
-I have to iron now.
-Ma!


685
00:53:01.133 --> 00:53:02.342
Change it!

686
00:53:02.968 --> 00:53:04.761
Mommy has to study.

687
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:08.932
I'm doing everything I can
to get us out of here.


688
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.102
Mr. Stinky Pants.

689
00:53:14.312 --> 00:53:15.772
What happened?

690
00:53:17.107 --> 00:53:18.608
What?!

691
00:53:19.818 --> 00:53:21.445
What happened?

692
00:53:22.195 --> 00:53:24.156
He peed in my mouth!

693
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:32.956
Come here, Jason.

694
00:53:33.332 --> 00:53:35.167
Come on, big boy.

695
00:53:37.169 --> 00:53:39.463
Jason, God bless you.

696
00:53:39.796 --> 00:53:44.843
You make your grandma so happy.
Mommy pee-pee mouth.


697
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:49.890
-I'll get this one.
-What do I do?


698
00:53:51.683 --> 00:53:53.852
Let's throw some more.

699
00:53:54.186 --> 00:53:55.354
Check it out.

700
00:53:56.063 --> 00:54:01.026
-I don't have any rocks.
-You don't need rocks after this.


701
00:54:03.362 --> 00:54:05.739
Yeah! All right!

702
00:54:05.947 --> 00:54:09.701
You okay?
How long you been sick?


703
00:54:10.494 --> 00:54:12.162
About ten--

704
00:54:17.042 --> 00:54:20.045
Hey, Al, I'm done for the day.

705
00:54:21.171 --> 00:54:22.756
All right, man.

706
00:54:23.048 --> 00:54:26.009
-See you tomorrow.
-On time, okay?


707
00:54:36.895 --> 00:54:41.525
-I see it.
-That's because we screwed up.


708
00:54:42.526 --> 00:54:44.194
I said to him:

709
00:54:45.404 --> 00:54:47.072
"B
-O
-B
-B
-Y...

710
00:54:47.698 --> 00:54:52.411
...if you re-enlist,
I want a D-I-V-O-R-C-E."


711
00:54:53.704 --> 00:54:56.581
I got the guts to say it.

712
00:54:56.915 --> 00:54:58.583
Know what he said?

713
00:55:00.919 --> 00:55:02.379
He wanted one too.

714
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:08.260
Sorry to bother you with this.

715
00:55:08.552 --> 00:55:10.887
Mom, we're stuck.

716
00:55:11.263 --> 00:55:13.890
He's met some girl named Monsoon.

717
00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:17.602
I'm here, taking care of our kid...

718
00:55:17.894 --> 00:55:21.481
...he's on some beach,
falling in love with Monsoon.


719
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.151
What kind of name is Monsoon?

720
00:55:24.443 --> 00:55:26.737
-Good.
-That's good?


721
00:55:26.945 --> 00:55:29.239
We know Bobby's not coming back.

722
00:55:29.489 --> 00:55:34.286
-What're you gonna do with your life?
-I don't know.


723
00:55:34.494 --> 00:55:35.746
Mommy!

724
00:55:37.289 --> 00:55:41.293
Fay has bigger problems right now.
Be considerate.


725
00:55:42.794 --> 00:55:44.087
What am I gonna do?

726
00:55:44.463 --> 00:55:47.591
You're a great artist.
Do something with that.


727
00:55:47.799 --> 00:55:51.261
-Like what?
-Like me and my scholarship.


728
00:55:51.595 --> 00:55:55.432
-I'm not as smart as you.
-I'll help you.


729
00:55:56.433 --> 00:56:00.145
-Just you and me.
-It's always you and me.


730
00:56:04.191 --> 00:56:05.650
Yeah!

731
00:56:07.778 --> 00:56:10.655
I can wear it and return it.

732
00:56:17.621 --> 00:56:19.581
Can you finish me up?

733
00:56:22.167 --> 00:56:23.502
Perfume.

734
00:56:25.671 --> 00:56:27.631
Ready, go.

735
00:56:27.798 --> 00:56:29.800
Okay, put it down.

736
00:56:38.684 --> 00:56:40.143
Come on.

737
00:56:42.646 --> 00:56:46.483
-How do I look?
-You look beautiful, Mommy.


738
00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:49.986
No, say that I look smart.

739
00:56:50.654 --> 00:56:53.532
You look smart, Mommy.
You do.


740
00:56:53.824 --> 00:56:55.200
Thank you.

741
00:56:55.534 --> 00:56:58.328
I'm going to drop you off
with Daddy.


742
00:56:59.162 --> 00:57:01.164
And then Mommy...

743
00:57:02.165 --> 00:57:06.378
...is gonna do something to change
the rest of our lives!


744
00:57:08.046 --> 00:57:09.673
Let's go!

745
00:57:12.843 --> 00:57:17.014
Stay with Daddy.
Later, we'll have a celebration.


746
00:57:19.016 --> 00:57:22.019
-Al, where's Ray?
-You tell me.


747
00:57:22.185 --> 00:57:24.730
He didn't show up for work.

748
00:57:25.355 --> 00:57:27.899
He comes and goes as he pleases.

749
00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:30.861
I can't believe this!

750
00:57:31.236 --> 00:57:34.406
-I want to stay with Daddy.
-He's not here.


751
00:57:34.614 --> 00:57:38.035
You have to come with me.
Get in the cab.


752
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.246
-I want to play.
-You'll play later.


753
00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:44.207
-I want to play.
-It won't take long.


754
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:48.045
Excuse me, where is
the interview room?


755
00:57:49.713 --> 00:57:51.089
Sorry.

756
00:57:53.216 --> 00:57:55.802
I called you for two reasons.

757
00:57:56.011 --> 00:58:00.557
One is to meet the girl
who wrote such a tremendous essay.


758
00:58:00.974 --> 00:58:05.729
The other is to compliment you
on your strong effort.


759
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:10.442
It's down to seven girls.
You should be proud.


760
00:58:11.443 --> 00:58:12.611
Thank you.

761
00:58:12.903 --> 00:58:16.907
If you pick me,
I will not let you down.


762
00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.951
I'll be everything you're looking for.

763
00:58:27.084 --> 00:58:29.086
What I'm getting at...

764
00:58:29.961 --> 00:58:34.925
...is we want to be very sure
that the person we give this to...


765
00:58:35.092 --> 00:58:38.762
...will not only graduate,
but go to grad school...


766
00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:41.139
...and not be someone who'll be....

767
00:58:43.725 --> 00:58:45.268
Distracted?

768
00:58:45.977 --> 00:58:47.604
-Yes.
-Not me.


769
00:58:47.854 --> 00:58:52.943
If you give me the scholarship,
it's like giving me my master's.


770
00:58:53.151 --> 00:58:55.612
Nothing gets in my way.

771
00:59:02.035 --> 00:59:04.788
You probably need to get going.

772
00:59:05.455 --> 00:59:07.290
We'll call when we know.

773
00:59:09.543 --> 00:59:11.461
When will you know?

774
00:59:12.796 --> 00:59:14.798
Two weeks.

775
00:59:15.799 --> 00:59:18.343
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Hasek.

776
00:59:19.136 --> 00:59:24.474
Don't make me go crazy for two weeks.
This means so much to me.


777
00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:25.976
Mr. Price...

778
00:59:28.145 --> 00:59:30.480
...I'm not gonna get this, am I?

779
00:59:34.192 --> 00:59:35.819
I'm sorry, no.

780
00:59:36.194 --> 00:59:38.196
N
-O. No.

781
00:59:52.711 --> 00:59:54.171
Daddy!

782
00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:59.843
-Hey, big guy.
-Come say hello to Uncle Lizzard.


783
01:00:00.886 --> 01:00:03.347
Look at you. Magazine.

784
01:00:05.932 --> 01:00:08.977
Why do I look like this today?

785
01:00:09.728 --> 01:00:12.939
Why do I look nice today?

786
01:00:15.067 --> 01:00:18.695
The most important day of my life?

787
01:00:22.741 --> 01:00:24.076
Yeah.

788
01:00:25.369 --> 01:00:27.537
Bev, I'm sorry.

789
01:00:27.788 --> 01:00:30.082
No, not sorry.
Where were you?


790
01:00:30.374 --> 01:00:33.752
-I was, I was at--
-No. Where were you?


791
01:00:34.878 --> 01:00:37.297
-I had--
-No.


792
01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:40.842
Where were you?

793
01:00:44.763 --> 01:00:48.600
-Say something.
-You can't hide behind Jason.


794
01:00:48.934 --> 01:00:52.104
-Yes, he can.
-I am invisible.


795
01:00:52.396 --> 01:00:57.150
-Help me out, boy.
-Hiding behind Jason won't work.


796
01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.448
Answer me.

797
01:01:07.786 --> 01:01:09.997
I forgot.

798
01:01:11.581 --> 01:01:14.418
You forgot?

799
01:01:15.627 --> 01:01:19.089
You forgot?
You forgot?!


800
01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.426
Haven't you had a dream?

801
01:01:23.176 --> 01:01:25.846
-Yeah.
-Shut up, Lizzard!


802
01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:34.354
I woke up this morning,
truly believing...


803
01:01:34.604 --> 01:01:39.109
...that by this afternoon,
my life would be different.


804
01:01:39.609 --> 01:01:44.948
Not only because it was my dream,
but because I'd earned it.


805
01:01:45.282 --> 01:01:47.659
And now look at me.

806
01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:53.290
It's 4 in the afternoon,
and I'm just another housewife...


807
01:01:53.665 --> 01:01:58.211
...yelling at her husband
in front of the neighbors.


808
01:01:58.837 --> 01:02:01.298
Yeah, that's me!

809
01:02:01.965 --> 01:02:04.676
Wonderful!
Thank you, Ray!


810
01:02:07.179 --> 01:02:09.139
You look smart, Mom.

811
01:02:10.515 --> 01:02:13.518
You do.
You look really smart.


812
01:02:13.852 --> 01:02:15.854
Come on, Bev.

813
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.192
The whole college thing,
it'll work out.


814
01:02:22.152 --> 01:02:24.321
No, it won't.

815
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.993
And I'll adjust.

816
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.710
Should I have left?

817
01:02:44.007 --> 01:02:46.009
I can't do anything right!

818
01:02:46.176 --> 01:02:48.178
You better clean that up!

819
01:02:54.017 --> 01:02:57.396
It's family legend
and a huge deal in her book...


820
01:02:57.604 --> 01:03:00.107
...the day she didn't get
her scholarship.


821
01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:03.110
To me it's not about Ray's mistake.

822
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.779
It's about how my mere presence...

823
01:03:05.987 --> 01:03:09.366
...forever crushed
all my mother's dreams.


824
01:03:11.576 --> 01:03:15.539
Is this a comfortable silence for you?

825
01:03:16.915 --> 01:03:18.375
Yes.

826
01:03:24.423 --> 01:03:29.219
Are we gonna do this all day?
You not telling me what's wrong.


827
01:03:34.391 --> 01:03:37.269
Okay, I'll tell you.

828
01:03:37.894 --> 01:03:40.063
But promise not to go crazy.

829
01:03:40.397 --> 01:03:41.898
I won't go crazy.

830
01:03:49.322 --> 01:03:51.616
I think I should transfer schools.

831
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:55.746
Instead of NYU,
I think Indiana might be nice.


832
01:03:57.622 --> 01:03:59.916
-No.
-Let me finish! I've--


833
01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:03.628
I don't want to hear it.
The answer is no.


834
01:04:03.837 --> 01:04:06.256
Two years and you're finished.

835
01:04:07.299 --> 01:04:12.304
You'll be a college graduate.
You'll have the life I dreamed of.


836
01:04:15.432 --> 01:04:17.267
Vic, these are for Mimi.

837
01:04:18.643 --> 01:04:20.145
Hi, Bev.

838
01:04:20.479 --> 01:04:23.440
We'd like 17 deluxe
Delite burgers, please.


839
01:04:23.815 --> 01:04:26.443
No, make that twenty Delite fries.

840
01:04:26.777 --> 01:04:29.946
And 20 Delite cones.

841
01:04:32.616 --> 01:04:35.160
Eleven dollars.
Twenty fries.


842
01:04:35.452 --> 01:04:38.830
Looks like Bev finally found
a job that suits her.


843
01:04:45.295 --> 01:04:46.296
They're ready.

844
01:04:47.839 --> 01:04:50.175
Ready? Here you go.

845
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.471
Hit it right there.
Hit the chief.


846
01:04:57.974 --> 01:04:59.309
Right here.

847
01:05:02.521 --> 01:05:06.525
Please, thank you.
No yelling.


848
01:05:08.193 --> 01:05:12.322
And smile, okay?
Even if she is a real bitch.


849
01:05:13.865 --> 01:05:17.202
Mrs. Forrester.
Nice to see you.


850
01:05:19.037 --> 01:05:20.664
Is Fay home?

851
01:05:21.832 --> 01:05:25.836
I swear, I haven't smiled in a month.

852
01:05:26.878 --> 01:05:30.674
Your mom taking the kids
to the movies is great.


853
01:05:30.882 --> 01:05:32.175
Shut the door.

854
01:05:35.512 --> 01:05:37.514
Play nice, kids.

855
01:05:41.351 --> 01:05:45.022
-What are these?
-Ray gave me two of them.


856
01:05:45.355 --> 01:05:48.400
What are they?
I don't want to see my skull.


857
01:05:49.192 --> 01:05:52.612
Ray always wants me
to take them with him.


858
01:05:52.863 --> 01:05:57.451
He says they're great to take
with someone you love and trust.


859
01:06:07.878 --> 01:06:09.796
-Fay?
-Yeah.


860
01:06:10.047 --> 01:06:15.385
-Do you love Amelia?
-Oh, man, don't get heavy on me now.


861
01:06:15.594 --> 01:06:17.054
It's a real question.

862
01:06:17.804 --> 01:06:21.641
-We didn't pick this.
-Because we got knocked up?


863
01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:29.566
-Romance took a strange turn for us.
-Yeah, we got knocked up.


864
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:36.615
I want to thank your mom.
Mrs. Forrester....


865
01:06:36.823 --> 01:06:42.120
I'd love to forgive each other for
whatever keeps us from being close.


866
01:06:42.746 --> 01:06:45.749
You've probably said
awful things about me.


867
01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:50.087
And you probably heard me
call you "ice crotch."


868
01:06:50.462 --> 01:06:54.466
-I thought you hated me.
-Amelia.


869
01:06:56.051 --> 01:07:00.889
-I'm taking Amelia to the movies.
-What about Jason?


870
01:07:01.098 --> 01:07:03.684
His mommy is leaving soon.

871
01:07:03.892 --> 01:07:07.854
I wouldn't want her to leave
without him. Let's go.


872
01:07:08.605 --> 01:07:10.273
Bye, sweetie.

873
01:07:10.607 --> 01:07:14.945
-She loved hearing that.
-It just fell out of my mouth.


874
01:07:18.782 --> 01:07:23.787
-Go inside and watch TV.
-I want to stay here with you.


875
01:07:24.121 --> 01:07:29.042
I'm having a hard time with you here,
and I need to talk to Fay.


876
01:07:30.419 --> 01:07:33.463
-Go.
-I don't have anything to do.


877
01:07:33.964 --> 01:07:37.592
Well, use your imagination!

878
01:07:41.138 --> 01:07:42.472
Go.

879
01:07:52.441 --> 01:07:53.442
So?

880
01:07:53.817 --> 01:07:56.820
So? What was the question?

881
01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.530
Do you love Amelia?

882
01:07:59.656 --> 01:08:02.784
Yes, I love her.
And you love Jason.


883
01:08:03.493 --> 01:08:06.371
-Right?
-Yeah, I love him, but....


884
01:08:06.663 --> 01:08:08.415
You love him but what?

885
01:08:10.334 --> 01:08:15.172
I don't know if I really love him
or I have to love him.


886
01:08:18.508 --> 01:08:21.845
And it scares me to death.

887
01:08:27.184 --> 01:08:30.479
Good people don't think this way.

888
01:08:34.523 --> 01:08:37.693
-What's wrong with me?
-Bev?


889
01:08:38.695 --> 01:08:40.530
Take my word on this.

890
01:08:42.657 --> 01:08:45.160
You really do love him.

891
01:08:45.702 --> 01:08:50.706
Sometimes we love people so much,
we have to be numb to it.


892
01:08:52.541 --> 01:08:56.046
If we actually felt how much,
it would kill us.


893
01:09:02.552 --> 01:09:08.224
That doesn't make you a bad person.
It means your heart's too big.


894
01:09:14.898 --> 01:09:17.067
Good way to look at it.

895
01:09:18.735 --> 01:09:20.278
Mom, help!

896
01:09:23.907 --> 01:09:26.742
Stay calm, stay calm.
Don't panic.


897
01:09:32.249 --> 01:09:35.168
-Get over here.
-Got him?


898
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:38.255
Don't pull him out yet.
He'll freeze.


899
01:09:38.421 --> 01:09:41.258
-I'm sorry.
-I'll get towels.


900
01:09:41.465 --> 01:09:47.055
This shouldn't have happened.
From now on, I'll be more attentive.


901
01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:49.766
-Do you know what that means?
-No.


902
01:09:49.974 --> 01:09:53.394
Responsible.
You know what responsible means?


903
01:09:53.769 --> 01:09:54.938
No.

904
01:09:55.605 --> 01:09:58.275
I should have read to you more!

905
01:09:58.442 --> 01:10:00.110
No! Come here!

906
01:10:01.445 --> 01:10:03.363
I'm so sorry!

907
01:10:06.783 --> 01:10:10.454
-I'm a terrible mother.
-Yeah.


908
01:10:26.636 --> 01:10:27.971
Scoot.

909
01:10:29.306 --> 01:10:30.307
Jason.

910
01:10:32.476 --> 01:10:33.810
I love you.

911
01:10:36.146 --> 01:10:37.481
Okay?

912
01:10:41.318 --> 01:10:43.987
They're playing kickball.

913
01:10:44.654 --> 01:10:46.490
Go play with them.

914
01:10:48.158 --> 01:10:50.327
Adults inside, kids outside.

915
01:10:59.503 --> 01:11:04.549
That's $20! You know how
much you can buy with that?


916
01:11:06.093 --> 01:11:09.513
My parents always
bought stuff I hated.


917
01:11:09.846 --> 01:11:12.182
The card is the real present.

918
01:11:12.683 --> 01:11:17.020
I got carried away,
but it's a plan for your life.


919
01:11:17.354 --> 01:11:19.189
Here, I'll read it to you.

920
01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:22.025
-"Dearest Jason--"
-Mom?


921
01:11:26.363 --> 01:11:31.034
We'll catch up later.
Are you ready to go have fun?


922
01:11:32.744 --> 01:11:34.079
Okay, good.

923
01:11:37.749 --> 01:11:39.084
Go have fun.

924
01:11:39.376 --> 01:11:41.545
Everybody, come in.

925
01:11:42.879 --> 01:11:44.339
Hi, Amelia.

926
01:11:44.548 --> 01:11:47.884
Davy, I got your stuff.
Get it later.


927
01:11:49.011 --> 01:11:53.056
-The card was the present?
-It's a plan for my life.


928
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:56.351
-She's crazy!
-You guys be careful.


929
01:12:00.564 --> 01:12:01.982
What?

930
01:12:04.401 --> 01:12:07.404
Minimum wage is what,
one-sixty an hour?


931
01:12:07.738 --> 01:12:11.408
I'll pay $160,
just to use your oven.


932
01:12:12.409 --> 01:12:17.122
I don't think my parents will let you
use their oven to dry weed.


933
01:12:22.252 --> 01:12:25.088
-Oh, Bev.
-I made it for him.


934
01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:26.631
You did a great job.

935
01:12:27.257 --> 01:12:30.135
You stayed up all night?
It looks delicious.


936
01:12:30.719 --> 01:12:31.928
You hog!

937
01:12:37.601 --> 01:12:38.977
Get me another beer.

938
01:12:39.186 --> 01:12:41.772
-I'm way ahead of you.
-Make it two.


939
01:12:47.778 --> 01:12:49.112
Bev?

940
01:12:53.116 --> 01:12:55.994
Don't tell me you don't remember me.

941
01:12:59.623 --> 01:13:03.960
Braces, short curly hair, pimples.

942
01:13:04.503 --> 01:13:06.546
Tommy?

943
01:13:08.965 --> 01:13:10.300
Wow.

944
01:13:13.637 --> 01:13:16.640
-So I graduated from Berkeley.
-Berkeley?


945
01:13:16.848 --> 01:13:20.560
Spent the year driving around,
seeing everything.


946
01:13:21.645 --> 01:13:26.149
In a few days I'm heading back
to California to get my master's.


947
01:13:26.483 --> 01:13:28.985
But I wanted to see you first.

948
01:13:29.277 --> 01:13:31.655
-You wanted to see me?
-Yeah.


949
01:13:31.863 --> 01:13:33.824
Just to say hi.

950
01:13:35.325 --> 01:13:37.160
-Hi.
-Hi.


951
01:13:38.912 --> 01:13:41.498
-Bev! Hey, Bev!
-Excuse me.


952
01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:45.002
-Tina!
-Bev.


953
01:13:45.627 --> 01:13:47.212
You actually came!

954
01:13:47.421 --> 01:13:49.840
-I'm so glad.
-Of course I came.


955
01:13:50.841 --> 01:13:54.761
-This is from Joey.
-Joey.


956
01:13:56.471 --> 01:13:58.015
Joe got you something?

957
01:13:58.348 --> 01:13:59.725
Thanks, Joe.

958
01:14:02.644 --> 01:14:06.189
-That's outside. Outside toy.
-Stop.


959
01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:11.236
-Come in and say hi.
-I can't. Kevin's waiting by the car.


960
01:14:13.113 --> 01:14:14.448
This is fiberglass.

961
01:14:15.115 --> 01:14:17.367
I just came to say goodbye.

962
01:14:17.576 --> 01:14:21.038
-What do you mean?
-Kevin and I are engaged.


963
01:14:21.705 --> 01:14:24.041
-You're pregnant.
-No.


964
01:14:24.249 --> 01:14:29.004
Kevin's been in school in New York.
He can't stand being away from me.


965
01:14:29.212 --> 01:14:33.800
I wanted to tell you before
you heard it. I'm going to college.


966
01:14:35.344 --> 01:14:40.140
Kevin's father got me into
that real good college in New York.


967
01:14:40.474 --> 01:14:43.060
-NYU?
-Yeah.


968
01:14:45.228 --> 01:14:48.440
-You're going to NYU?
-Yeah.


969
01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:52.361
Holy shit. It's Jackie O.
Come here!


970
01:14:52.694 --> 01:14:54.738
Fay, the divorcĂ©e!

971
01:14:54.905 --> 01:14:59.034
This is the only thing
my father ever gave me.


972
01:15:00.243 --> 01:15:03.538
It's supposed to be lucky,
but it wasn't for him.


973
01:15:03.747 --> 01:15:08.043
And it hasn't been for me.
Maybe it'll be lucky for you.


974
01:15:08.251 --> 01:15:09.586
Maybe it's stupid.

975
01:15:11.046 --> 01:15:12.381
I couldn't wrap it.

976
01:15:12.589 --> 01:15:17.678
They're not stupid. They're great!
I love your guts, Dad!


977
01:15:17.886 --> 01:15:20.389
I love your guts too, buddy.

978
01:15:22.057 --> 01:15:26.019
Bye! I love you guys!
I'll call, okay? I swear!


979
01:15:26.228 --> 01:15:28.563
-Bye, girls!
-Bye!


980
01:15:28.772 --> 01:15:31.483
Come visit me in New York, okay?

981
01:15:49.584 --> 01:15:50.877
Hey.

982
01:15:53.964 --> 01:15:55.590
Sorry.

983
01:15:56.299 --> 01:15:58.093
Did I scare you?

984
01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.637
No.

985
01:16:01.555 --> 01:16:03.598
What are you doing here?

986
01:16:03.807 --> 01:16:06.768
I wanted to see if you were okay.

987
01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:09.312
You okay?

988
01:16:15.444 --> 01:16:17.195
Wanna go for a walk?

989
01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:25.412
-Maybe just around the....
-Good. Come on.


990
01:16:33.503 --> 01:16:36.423
Tell me what you're thinking
right now.


991
01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.969
I'm 22 years old.
That's almost 30.


992
01:16:41.178 --> 01:16:44.681
I still haven't accepted
that this is my life.


993
01:16:46.016 --> 01:16:50.520
I wish I could be dumb
and then I wouldn't know better.


994
01:16:50.979 --> 01:16:55.650
And I could be happy
and stop hoping.


995
01:16:55.859 --> 01:17:01.156
And I'm telling you this like
you're interested in my boring life.


996
01:17:02.157 --> 01:17:05.535
Come to California with me.
I've got room.


997
01:17:05.827 --> 01:17:08.121
I could take all of you.

998
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:12.167
If you want to change your life,
you can.


999
01:17:12.376 --> 01:17:14.795
If money's tight,
it doesn't matter.


1000
01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:18.048
You've always been smart.
It's easy.


1001
01:17:18.382 --> 01:17:21.385
-You want to go to college?
-Yes.


1002
01:17:21.551 --> 01:17:23.053
The state pays.

1003
01:17:23.261 --> 01:17:26.515
The state pays, Bev.

1004
01:17:33.063 --> 01:17:37.901
-Ray won't go for it.
-If Ray loves you, he'll do it.


1005
01:17:39.194 --> 01:17:40.862
Right?

1006
01:17:42.823 --> 01:17:48.704
Just do whatever it takes to get
out of here. You don't belong here.


1007
01:17:50.372 --> 01:17:51.873
You don't.

1008
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:09.099
Thank you for saying
the things you said tonight.


1009
01:18:09.933 --> 01:18:12.728
It's just good to see you smile.

1010
01:18:14.771 --> 01:18:16.440
-Mom!
-Yes!


1011
01:18:16.606 --> 01:18:18.817
I woke up and you were gone!

1012
01:18:19.026 --> 01:18:22.279
She's not supposed
to leave a kid alone!


1013
01:18:22.487 --> 01:18:26.116
It's dangerous!
I could have choked!


1014
01:18:28.452 --> 01:18:30.579
I'll talk to Ray.

1015
01:18:32.622 --> 01:18:35.792
Just let me know.
My classes start up.


1016
01:18:36.418 --> 01:18:39.921
Good night, Bev.
Good night, Jason.


1017
01:18:43.425 --> 01:18:46.386
What do you think
about California?


1018
01:18:46.595 --> 01:18:48.096
I told you to stop it.

1019
01:18:51.433 --> 01:18:53.477
Well, I just....

1020
01:18:59.816 --> 01:19:01.985
Wanna go to California?

1021
01:19:02.152 --> 01:19:04.988
I wanna go if you wanna go.

1022
01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:17.334
-All right. Let's go to California.
-Yes, Ray!


1023
01:19:18.168 --> 01:19:22.839
-Thank you, Ray! Thank you!
-Yeah.


1024
01:19:24.174 --> 01:19:27.803
Don't forget to get
baby aspirin for Jason.


1025
01:19:28.011 --> 01:19:30.806
Baby aspirin, okay.

1026
01:19:31.014 --> 01:19:36.812
-I'll finish packing.
-Yeah, baby aspirin.


1027
01:19:37.187 --> 01:19:41.525
-You guys seen Lizzard?
-No, sorry.


1028
01:19:45.404 --> 01:19:50.075
-Hello?
-You better get over here. It's Ray.


1029
01:19:57.541 --> 01:20:00.210
Okay, up the stairs. Up.

1030
01:20:06.633 --> 01:20:09.761
-Where's Ray?
-I'm sorry about California.


1031
01:20:11.013 --> 01:20:14.016
-What--?
-He's downstairs with your father.


1032
01:20:14.224 --> 01:20:16.518
-What's going on?
-Don't know.


1033
01:20:16.727 --> 01:20:19.521
Why don't you sit here?
Come on.


1034
01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:21.398
Get your jacket off.

1035
01:20:21.648 --> 01:20:23.525
-Say it.
-All right.


1036
01:20:23.734 --> 01:20:25.235
Okay.

1037
01:20:31.408 --> 01:20:35.412
-Jason, how's it going over there?
-Trouble.


1038
01:20:35.996 --> 01:20:39.166
Your husband has come to me
with a problem.


1039
01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:41.710
And he wants my help.

1040
01:20:45.005 --> 01:20:46.590
Raymond?

1041
01:20:52.929 --> 01:20:55.265
Hey, Bev, how's it going?

1042
01:20:57.392 --> 01:20:59.102
Okay.

1043
01:21:00.604 --> 01:21:02.314
I got a....

1044
01:21:04.107 --> 01:21:06.526
I can't do it without a....

1045
01:21:08.111 --> 01:21:09.988
"Dear Beverly.

1046
01:21:10.614 --> 01:21:13.450
Please don't go crazy
when you hear this.


1047
01:21:13.742 --> 01:21:19.498
But I regret to inform you
that I am...


1048
01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.501
...a junkie.

1049
01:21:22.918 --> 01:21:28.090
I spent all our money on heroin.
I spent everything.


1050
01:21:28.298 --> 01:21:31.051
I even spent the money...

1051
01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.971
...for Jason's aspirin on a fix."

1052
01:21:36.765 --> 01:21:39.351
It was just a tiny fix.

1053
01:21:41.144 --> 01:21:45.232
-But I spent that too.
-Heroin?


1054
01:21:46.316 --> 01:21:50.153
I knew you drank a lot,
but heroin?


1055
01:21:50.487 --> 01:21:52.864
Jesus, Ray!

1056
01:21:55.826 --> 01:21:57.327
For how long?

1057
01:21:58.996 --> 01:22:01.164
-I don't know.
-No....


1058
01:22:01.999 --> 01:22:05.669
-How long?
-Two years, October 31.


1059
01:22:07.337 --> 01:22:09.381
Halloween night.

1060
01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:12.426
Remember when Jason
was a monkey?


1061
01:22:12.843 --> 01:22:15.554
-Stop listening!
-You've been sick.


1062
01:22:15.762 --> 01:22:19.933
-I'm clearing up.
-I feel so stupid for not knowing!


1063
01:22:20.142 --> 01:22:22.019
Bev, I'm really sorry.

1064
01:22:22.477 --> 01:22:26.898
Shut up. Don't say sorry.
Sorry doesn't mean anything.


1065
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:30.569
-Stop.
-No! This is the last time.


1066
01:22:31.278 --> 01:22:34.197
You're not helping.
You don't pay attention!


1067
01:22:34.406 --> 01:22:38.869
Listen. Everything I'm doing
right now is for that boy.


1068
01:22:39.494 --> 01:22:42.414
He needs a father.
This is his father.


1069
01:22:42.873 --> 01:22:46.710
I didn't pick him.
He'll be sick for a while.


1070
01:22:46.918 --> 01:22:51.340
Your mother and I will take Jason
while you help him. Got it?


1071
01:22:51.548 --> 01:22:55.927
I don't want your help.
I can take care of my own kid.


1072
01:23:04.144 --> 01:23:08.065
Okay, Ray, I cleaned you a new one.
Okay?


1073
01:23:08.398 --> 01:23:10.108
You feel better?

1074
01:23:11.443 --> 01:23:14.571
You going to throw up again?
Here, Ray.


1075
01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:18.450
Here, Ray. Here.
Oh, no!


1076
01:23:20.202 --> 01:23:23.205
This is so gross.

1077
01:23:23.413 --> 01:23:26.041
Oh, my God!
Please kill me!


1078
01:23:26.249 --> 01:23:30.337
Fine! Stop screaming.
You're gonna scare Jason.


1079
01:23:30.545 --> 01:23:33.924
Oh, my God. Bev!

1080
01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:37.886
-I'll get more sheets.
-Bev, please! Help me!


1081
01:23:38.095 --> 01:23:40.430
Is Dad okay?

1082
01:23:40.889 --> 01:23:45.769
-What's your favorite song?
-"Cincinnati Dancing Pig."


1083
01:24:29.479 --> 01:24:31.648
Scoot over.

1084
01:24:33.942 --> 01:24:36.194
I need to rest between rounds.

1085
01:24:39.656 --> 01:24:43.660
Sorry you didn't get to
go to California.


1086
01:24:43.827 --> 01:24:48.957
Please turn off the pig song!
It's not helping much.


1087
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.004
Turn off that song!

1088
01:25:03.388 --> 01:25:06.516
-What are you doing?
-Making you breakfast.


1089
01:25:06.725 --> 01:25:08.185
Thank you.

1090
01:25:08.352 --> 01:25:12.439
-Why are you whispering?
-I don't wanna wake your dad.


1091
01:25:12.647 --> 01:25:15.275
He's not here.
He left.


1092
01:25:20.947 --> 01:25:23.700
Ray?

1093
01:25:44.388 --> 01:25:45.889
Hey.

1094
01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:51.269
Bev? Let me just....

1095
01:25:51.978 --> 01:25:55.774
Jason's in his room.
He can hear us.


1096
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:58.360
All right, Bev. Look....

1097
01:25:58.568 --> 01:26:00.529
Look at me.

1098
01:26:01.905 --> 01:26:03.407
What?

1099
01:26:08.286 --> 01:26:11.415
Don't say you're sorry.

1100
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:13.917
-Just go.
-No!


1101
01:26:14.126 --> 01:26:18.505
I know what you're thinking.
I've got it figured out.


1102
01:26:18.714 --> 01:26:20.632
All right? Look.

1103
01:26:22.509 --> 01:26:25.762
I just can't quit, okay?

1104
01:26:25.929 --> 01:26:29.725
You can't hold it against me
if it's impossible.


1105
01:26:29.933 --> 01:26:33.186
It's just who I am.
All right?


1106
01:26:33.395 --> 01:26:39.109
All I need is a little, to keep me
straight. Not enough to get me high.


1107
01:26:39.484 --> 01:26:43.864
Just enough to keep me straight.
Just like this.


1108
01:26:47.659 --> 01:26:50.120
So, what if we keep it at that?

1109
01:26:50.662 --> 01:26:55.292
You want permission to use
a small amount of heroin forever?


1110
01:26:57.252 --> 01:26:58.337
Okay.

1111
01:26:58.712 --> 01:27:01.131
I am gonna get a good job.

1112
01:27:01.548 --> 01:27:04.217
-And, one, look--
-No.


1113
01:27:04.426 --> 01:27:05.802
What?

1114
01:27:08.055 --> 01:27:09.306
No.

1115
01:27:09.681 --> 01:27:12.601
Bev, come on.

1116
01:27:16.063 --> 01:27:18.482
This plan works!

1117
01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:20.233
Ray.

1118
01:27:24.196 --> 01:27:28.700
-You need to think like a grownup now.
-All right.


1119
01:27:29.534 --> 01:27:35.457
Like a 40-year-old businessman
who takes a train to work every day...


1120
01:27:35.666 --> 01:27:38.710
...and makes responsible decisions.

1121
01:27:39.586 --> 01:27:42.339
-Can you do that?
-Yeah. I'll try.


1122
01:27:42.673 --> 01:27:45.550
You say it's impossible to quit.

1123
01:27:45.759 --> 01:27:51.348
I believe you.
I won't even hold it against you.


1124
01:27:51.598 --> 01:27:55.185
But if you stay
and you ruin our lives...


1125
01:27:55.394 --> 01:27:57.688
...and you know that you will...

1126
01:28:00.273 --> 01:28:02.776
...then it's my fault.

1127
01:28:06.113 --> 01:28:08.824
Do you want me to live with that?

1128
01:28:16.081 --> 01:28:18.041
No.

1129
01:28:29.177 --> 01:28:30.220
Hey, Dad.

1130
01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:35.225
-Guess what?
-What?


1131
01:28:36.268 --> 01:28:38.228
I lost my tooth.

1132
01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.565
See?

1133
01:28:54.828 --> 01:28:56.246
Well.

1134
01:28:58.498 --> 01:29:02.377
-I just came in to say good night.
-Good night, Dad.


1135
01:29:09.176 --> 01:29:12.721
-I love your guts, buddy.
-I love you.


1136
01:29:13.472 --> 01:29:16.433
Dad, are you going somewhere?

1137
01:29:21.855 --> 01:29:23.690
Can I come?

1138
01:29:26.026 --> 01:29:27.652
Why can't I come?

1139
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.238
Because your mom...

1140
01:29:30.489 --> 01:29:36.036
...doesn't think it's a good idea
if we're around each other any more.


1141
01:29:36.578 --> 01:29:38.747
I'm not supposed to say that.

1142
01:29:49.007 --> 01:29:52.135
You're gonna hear
a lot of bad things about me.


1143
01:29:52.886 --> 01:29:54.513
Okay?

1144
01:29:54.888 --> 01:29:59.184
But only two out of the three things
are gonna be right.


1145
01:29:59.393 --> 01:30:05.482
So when you hear something
that's really, really bad...


1146
01:30:05.857 --> 01:30:11.488
...you try to think that's
the one time they're wrong, okay?


1147
01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:14.491
Okay.

1148
01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:17.327
All right?

1149
01:30:17.577 --> 01:30:21.540
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too.


1150
01:30:21.748 --> 01:30:23.667
All right, buddy?

1151
01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:27.838
Okay, I gotta go.

1152
01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:33.927
I gotta go!

1153
01:30:34.678 --> 01:30:38.223
Dad! Wait!

1154
01:30:38.432 --> 01:30:40.183
Dad, wait!

1155
01:30:40.392 --> 01:30:42.769
Dad, wait!

1156
01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:46.398
Jason, what are you doing?

1157
01:30:48.191 --> 01:30:50.527
Jason, you cannot go with him!

1158
01:30:50.736 --> 01:30:52.904
Dad, wait!

1159
01:30:53.113 --> 01:30:57.200
Dad! I wanna go with you!

1160
01:30:57.409 --> 01:31:01.538
-Jason?!
-Wait! Dad!


1161
01:31:01.705 --> 01:31:04.916
-Jason.
-Take me with you!


1162
01:31:05.334 --> 01:31:10.213
You're mad, but we wouldn't
have had a chance unless I did this.


1163
01:31:10.964 --> 01:31:13.467
Leave me alone.

1164
01:31:15.927 --> 01:31:19.389
Leave me alone!

1165
01:31:20.307 --> 01:31:24.102
If you get out of the street,
I'll leave you alone.


1166
01:31:30.442 --> 01:31:35.072
But remember,
I am your mother.


1167
01:31:37.324 --> 01:31:40.869
That means you're not allowed
to stay mad at me!


1168
01:31:53.131 --> 01:31:55.634
-Can I get two coffees, black?
-Sure.


1169
01:31:55.842 --> 01:31:59.137
-Where's the bathroom?
-Two coffees, to go.


1170
01:32:04.768 --> 01:32:06.645
-Hello?
-Amelia.


1171
01:32:07.187 --> 01:32:12.442
Jason. I'm so glad it's you.
Have you seen your father?


1172
01:32:12.776 --> 01:32:17.072
-No, we're not there yet. I--
-I got your message.


1173
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.450
-You did?
-Yeah.


1174
01:32:21.159 --> 01:32:22.786
I love you too.

1175
01:32:23.453 --> 01:32:27.958
This is the greatest conversation
of my life!


1176
01:32:28.166 --> 01:32:31.336
This is the greatest conversation
of my life.


1177
01:32:32.379 --> 01:32:33.797
Okay.

1178
01:32:34.006 --> 01:32:38.552
So, I'm all packed.
I've almost got you all packed.


1179
01:32:38.885 --> 01:32:41.805
And we're leaving tonight.

1180
01:32:44.057 --> 01:32:47.519
-How did your mom take it?
-There was a discussion.


1181
01:32:47.728 --> 01:32:51.356
And she had some questions.

1182
01:32:51.732 --> 01:32:53.984
But I think...

1183
01:32:54.192 --> 01:32:57.988
...I figured a way for it
to be okay with everyone.


1184
01:32:58.196 --> 01:33:00.866
-You did?
-You transfer here.


1185
01:33:03.035 --> 01:33:07.748
-What are you talking about?
-I don't know. I'm just....


1186
01:33:08.081 --> 01:33:10.667
-Jase!
-I'm screwing us up.


1187
01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:15.005
No. No.

1188
01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:20.635
You are not allowed
to feel bad about us. Okay?


1189
01:33:21.094 --> 01:33:25.682
Listen to me. I am not
another woman you have to handle.


1190
01:33:27.309 --> 01:33:32.189
If you don't go with me, we'll
see each other every chance we get.


1191
01:33:32.397 --> 01:33:35.400
-You are amazing.
-No, I'm not.


1192
01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:38.362
-You are.
-I'm not.


1193
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:40.280
I'm furious at her!

1194
01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:45.077
But...

1195
01:33:47.746 --> 01:33:50.207
...I can't give up on you.

1196
01:33:50.624 --> 01:33:56.380
Someday you'll stop raising her.
You've been doing it your whole life.


1197
01:33:57.255 --> 01:34:02.761
You're young. You deserve to be young.
We deserve to be young together.


1198
01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:06.390
Right now,
I can't make you happy, so...


1199
01:34:07.307 --> 01:34:09.935
-...I gotta go.
-Amelia, wait.


1200
01:34:10.268 --> 01:34:13.105
I'll call you when my flight gets in.

1201
01:34:14.106 --> 01:34:16.066
I love you so much.

1202
01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:27.828
Sorry.

1203
01:34:35.752 --> 01:34:37.754
Jason, are you coming?

1204
01:34:52.644 --> 01:34:55.814
Do my grocery shopping,
and I'll pay you.


1205
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:07.951
-Every station's in color.
-Who'd you steal it from?


1206
01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.703
I bought it.

1207
01:35:12.372 --> 01:35:16.376
I was wondering
if we could be alone for a minute.


1208
01:35:17.336 --> 01:35:21.006
Alone is an unknown dimension to me.
Talk.


1209
01:35:21.214 --> 01:35:25.260
I know I'm not
your favorite person in the world.


1210
01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:30.474
But I'd like to help.
Ray was a good friend.


1211
01:35:30.682 --> 01:35:35.437
I'd like to offer you a job.
$200 an hour to use your stove.


1212
01:35:35.687 --> 01:35:38.357
Goodbye, Lizzard.
Take the TV.


1213
01:35:38.565 --> 01:35:41.985
No. It's a gift for me.
Isn't it?


1214
01:35:42.235 --> 01:35:44.321
Yes, it is.

1215
01:35:45.238 --> 01:35:47.324
It's a gift. For him.

1216
01:35:47.491 --> 01:35:51.578
-We need to have a family talk.
-It's not your fault.


1217
01:35:52.287 --> 01:35:54.998
You handle a kid by
taking things away.


1218
01:35:55.165 --> 01:36:00.629
But he doesn't have anything
to take away. Now he does.


1219
01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:03.006
I'll just wait here.

1220
01:36:03.173 --> 01:36:05.467
It's not fair, Ma!

1221
01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:08.679
I'm the only kid
without a color TV.


1222
01:36:08.887 --> 01:36:12.974
Well, I'm the only mother
who wears ripped pantyhose.


1223
01:36:13.266 --> 01:36:17.396
I'm the only kid I know
who wears ripped socks!


1224
01:36:18.355 --> 01:36:21.566
I'm the only mother
whose shoes talk to people!


1225
01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:23.694
And I do everything here!

1226
01:36:23.902 --> 01:36:27.531
I have to shop, cook, clean
and do the laundry!


1227
01:36:27.739 --> 01:36:30.075
I never get to play!

1228
01:36:30.283 --> 01:36:33.704
Yeah? Neither do I!
I go to night school.


1229
01:36:34.037 --> 01:36:39.710
When you work a double shift, I use
the spare time to sleep and bathe.


1230
01:36:39.876 --> 01:36:42.379
-We're a team, right?
-No!


1231
01:36:42.546 --> 01:36:47.175
You're supposed to be the mother!
I'm supposed to be the kid!


1232
01:36:55.767 --> 01:36:57.269
Yeah.

1233
01:37:00.605 --> 01:37:04.609
-Let us in! Amelia's freezing!
-I'm not cold.


1234
01:37:11.908 --> 01:37:14.244
My father wrote me again.

1235
01:37:14.453 --> 01:37:17.247
He put in another picture
of his wife.


1236
01:37:17.789 --> 01:37:21.168
He wants me
to call her Mother Monsoon.


1237
01:37:21.793 --> 01:37:27.507
I wrote back saying, "She's not my
mother. Only my mother's my mother."


1238
01:37:28.467 --> 01:37:31.303
I hate him.

1239
01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:37.267
Come on, Amelia.
Don't cry.


1240
01:37:37.726 --> 01:37:39.978
At least your father writes.

1241
01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:44.107
He thinks about you.
I'll tell you this much.


1242
01:37:44.274 --> 01:37:48.445
Wherever my dad is,
I'd rather be there than out here.


1243
01:37:52.657 --> 01:37:54.368
We've got to focus.

1244
01:37:54.576 --> 01:37:57.537
This will get all
of us out of here.

1245
01:37:57.746 --> 01:38:01.500
And I won't have to ask
my parents for money. Okay?


1246
01:38:02.334 --> 01:38:06.463
When we move to New York,
I'll find the richest guy.


1247
01:38:07.297 --> 01:38:10.300
We'll live in a penthouse.

1248
01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:17.349
You'll be a famous author,
and we'll have book-signing parties.


1249
01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:23.146
-Hey.
-Hey, Grandpa.


1250
01:38:23.313 --> 01:38:28.276
Your grandma wanted me to bring this.
You need it. Give me a kiss.


1251
01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:31.029
You're so big.

1252
01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:34.408
Your mom care you're throwing snow
at the house?


1253
01:38:34.866 --> 01:38:39.454
Our mothers went to the store.
They won't be back for a long time.


1254
01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.498
Is that so?

1255
01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:45.168
Don't break any windows.

1256
01:38:45.377 --> 01:38:49.756
It's your turn to pick a night
to stay over, huh? Button up.


1257
01:38:53.552 --> 01:38:55.512
Grandpa?

1258
01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.728
Mom's inside drying weed.

1259
01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.944
Oh, boy.
These kids got small voices, huh?


1260
01:39:11.153 --> 01:39:15.991
-What do you think of that?
-I didn't hear a thing. Let's go.


1261
01:39:17.576 --> 01:39:19.369
Leo, come on.

1262
01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.256
Hasek. You made bail.

1263
01:39:35.761 --> 01:39:38.972
The kid's out,
they're in business in a day.


1264
01:39:40.098 --> 01:39:46.104
Go to Main Street. You know the old
brick building? He's chopping cars.


1265
01:39:49.608 --> 01:39:52.569
-Can you fix this?
-Sure.


1266
01:39:52.778 --> 01:39:54.279
How did they know?

1267
01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:56.740
I won't ever tell you told.

1268
01:39:56.948 --> 01:40:01.662
If there's anyone in the world
you can trust, it's me.


1269
01:40:01.995 --> 01:40:03.622
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.


1270
01:40:07.626 --> 01:40:13.423
They took it all. All the money
I was saving to get to New York. Gone.


1271
01:40:15.425 --> 01:40:19.304
They didn't take it.
I used it to bail you out.


1272
01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:23.141
Why didn't you borrow it
from your parents?


1273
01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:28.980
My parents wouldn't bail me out!
Did you want me to leave you there?


1274
01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:33.610
-No. Who bailed you out?
-Dennis.


1275
01:40:35.487 --> 01:40:40.158
-I thought he wasn't talking to you.
-Yeah, well...


1276
01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:45.163
...he rode into town on his big
white horse to save the family name.


1277
01:40:46.999 --> 01:40:49.209
But I had to make him a deal.

1278
01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.336
What kind of deal?

1279
01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:54.339
Since my parents
are kicking me out...


1280
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:58.468
...he wants to bring me and Amelia
to Arizona with him.


1281
01:40:58.677 --> 01:41:04.474
He said he'll cover my rent
and food and anything I want.


1282
01:41:04.683 --> 01:41:08.562
-If I don't....
-If you don't what?


1283
01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:12.774
If I don't see you anymore.

1284
01:41:14.693 --> 01:41:18.321
But I'm gonna tell him
no way tomorrow.


1285
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:19.823
I'll....

1286
01:41:46.224 --> 01:41:48.852
They like to hug a lot.

1287
01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.023
They'll never keep us apart.

1288
01:41:58.904 --> 01:42:01.615
I'll call you as
soon as I get there.

1289
01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.076
I love you.

1290
01:42:06.745 --> 01:42:09.414
Come on, Amelia.
We got to go now.


1291
01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:14.461
Bye.

1292
01:42:16.088 --> 01:42:18.215
Bye, Jason.

1293
01:42:23.095 --> 01:42:24.888
Jason, get in the car.

1294
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:28.058
-Would you go, Dennis?
-All right.


1295
01:42:29.726 --> 01:42:32.187
Dennis, drive carefully.

1296
01:42:44.741 --> 01:42:50.038
If I told you something important,
you promise not to get mad?


1297
01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:52.457
Tell me. What?

1298
01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:58.088
You got to swear not to get mad,
or else I'm not going to tell you.


1299
01:42:58.296 --> 01:43:00.257
Fine. I swear.

1300
01:43:02.467 --> 01:43:04.594
I told Grandpa.

1301
01:43:05.095 --> 01:43:07.597
You told Grandpa what?

1302
01:43:07.973 --> 01:43:11.226
I told him you were inside
drying weed.


1303
01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:14.104
You what?

1304
01:43:27.826 --> 01:43:31.830
-Why would you do that? Why?
-I don't know.


1305
01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:38.420
You don't destroy everybody's life
and then say, "I don't know." Why?


1306
01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:42.966
I was gonna use that money
to get us out of here.


1307
01:43:43.175 --> 01:43:47.137
Do you understand?
You just ruined our lives!


1308
01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:51.933
That's not what you say
when someone tells the truth.


1309
01:43:52.851 --> 01:43:58.148
And the worst thing of all is
Fay is gone. Because of you.


1310
01:44:01.193 --> 01:44:03.278
I have no one.

1311
01:44:11.328 --> 01:44:13.080
Some things never change.

1312
01:44:13.288 --> 01:44:18.251
Like me being confused about
everything except what she's feeling.


1313
01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.128
We must be getting close.

1314
01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:22.339
This is where he lives.

1315
01:44:22.506 --> 01:44:26.843
She won't admit it,
but she's scared about seeing Ray.


1316
01:44:41.024 --> 01:44:43.985
Are you sure you'll be okay
seeing him?


1317
01:44:44.861 --> 01:44:46.363
Sure.

1318
01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:51.493
You can wait in the car if you want.
I completely understand.


1319
01:44:51.702 --> 01:44:53.203
I'm fine.

1320
01:45:06.883 --> 01:45:10.554
Coming! Just a second!

1321
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:14.891
I'll get my robe on!

1322
01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:27.529
-Does Raymond Hasek live here?
-And you are?


1323
01:45:28.405 --> 01:45:30.073
Beverly.

1324
01:45:33.201 --> 01:45:38.332
-It's for you. Get up!
-Hold on, I'm coming.


1325
01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:42.836
Come on in. He's indisposed,
You might as well come in.


1326
01:45:43.628 --> 01:45:45.339
Thank you.

1327
01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:50.761
Sorry, we weren't expecting company.

1328
01:45:50.969 --> 01:45:54.097
-You've got cool stuff.
-I collect things.


1329
01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:58.935
Is it hunting season?

1330
01:45:59.603 --> 01:46:04.441
That's the firing range.
You into that?


1331
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.611
Some people....
Ray!


1332
01:46:08.111 --> 01:46:09.780
Just a sec.

1333
01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:18.622
Ray, it's me.

1334
01:46:21.291 --> 01:46:22.918
Beverly.

1335
01:46:25.545 --> 01:46:27.589
Bev! Hey!

1336
01:46:28.632 --> 01:46:31.093
Hey, Bev. It's me, Ray.

1337
01:46:35.347 --> 01:46:38.475
I never thought of you as being older.

1338
01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:48.402
Beverly, this is Shirley.

1339
01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:51.613
Shirley, this is my first wife.

1340
01:46:52.698 --> 01:46:53.824
Hello.

1341
01:46:54.991 --> 01:46:56.827
Charmed.

1342
01:46:58.495 --> 01:46:59.997
Hey, man.

1343
01:47:00.497 --> 01:47:03.417
Ray, this is your son, Jason.

1344
01:47:14.511 --> 01:47:17.055
I wouldn't have known you.

1345
01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:27.315
Hey, thanks.

1346
01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:32.988
Hey, you wanna sit down?
Come on.


1347
01:47:33.363 --> 01:47:37.743
Clear off the thing.
Have a seat.


1348
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:43.665
Right there is good.
Something to drink?


1349
01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:46.877
-Something to drink?
-We don't have anything.


1350
01:47:47.044 --> 01:47:50.005
Get them an orange thing.

1351
01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:52.632
A moment alone, Ray?

1352
01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:55.177
-Kool-Aid?
-You want to--


1353
01:47:55.385 --> 01:48:00.057
-I'm not going anywhere.
-Yeah. Thanks.


1354
01:48:01.099 --> 01:48:03.393
Right.

1355
01:48:05.854 --> 01:48:07.564
Let me lay this out.

1356
01:48:07.731 --> 01:48:13.362
I've been making my living working
at a small newspaper in New York.


1357
01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:16.656
But at night, for 6 years...

1358
01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:21.495
-...I've been writing a book.
-Four years.


1359
01:48:21.703 --> 01:48:24.581
You started the book
when I turned 16.


1360
01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:28.835
It was my birthday present.
That was four years ago.


1361
01:48:29.252 --> 01:48:34.341
-Fine, four years. Happy?
-Just give it to him right.


1362
01:48:38.595 --> 01:48:41.056
Kool
-Aid.

1363
01:48:41.515 --> 01:48:42.974
Enjoy.

1364
01:48:44.476 --> 01:48:48.897
-I finished the book.
-Really? That's great.


1365
01:48:50.023 --> 01:48:52.484
And they want to publish it.

1366
01:48:54.111 --> 01:48:57.197
You know this is huge for me.

1367
01:48:57.406 --> 01:49:01.535
It's what I've wanted
for as long as I can remember.


1368
01:49:05.747 --> 01:49:08.625
But it's a small publishing house.

1369
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:15.632
Since you're in so much of it,
they wanna be careful about lawsuits.


1370
01:49:15.841 --> 01:49:21.304
There's a lot about you and drugs and
illegal acts. It's not flattering.


1371
01:49:21.471 --> 01:49:23.640
Anyway...

1372
01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:27.436
...what I'm getting at is...

1373
01:49:28.603 --> 01:49:31.773
...they need you
to sign this release...


1374
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:35.110
...or they can't risk publishing it.

1375
01:49:38.655 --> 01:49:40.240
I get it.

1376
01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:43.994
Excuse me.

1377
01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:48.915
Excuse me, Ray.
Honey, stop.


1378
01:49:49.333 --> 01:49:52.169
-Give me that.
-She has to pay you.


1379
01:49:52.336 --> 01:49:58.508
-You're in her book. She'll get rich.
-What are you talking about?


1380
01:49:59.176 --> 01:50:02.304
-I'm asking how much we get.
-I don't--


1381
01:50:02.512 --> 01:50:05.182
-Why are you starting?
-$100,000.


1382
01:50:05.599 --> 01:50:07.017
What?!

1383
01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:13.273
-Did I ever ask for child support?
-Get out.


1384
01:50:13.815 --> 01:50:18.445
-Hey, come on.
-Come back when you got money.


1385
01:50:18.653 --> 01:50:20.697
-Calm down.
-I'm not leaving.


1386
01:50:20.864 --> 01:50:23.909
-Just get up.
-We can't leave.


1387
01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:27.788
I'm the one busting my ass
to get us out of here!


1388
01:50:27.996 --> 01:50:30.707
If you think about moving,
I'm gone.


1389
01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:35.962
-I will never forgive you!
-We'll get over it, trust me.


1390
01:50:36.838 --> 01:50:41.009
We should've given you more time
to talk. I'm sorry.


1391
01:50:41.218 --> 01:50:43.345
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1392
01:50:44.054 --> 01:50:48.183
-What are you doing?
-You were gonna sign your life away.


1393
01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:52.187
What were you thinking?
God, I can't stand her!


1394
01:50:54.356 --> 01:50:56.525
-Give me the keys.
-No.


1395
01:50:56.733 --> 01:51:01.738
You don't care. I'm not getting
published, and you don't even care.


1396
01:51:03.657 --> 01:51:07.953
I just saw a guy
who hasn't showered in a month.


1397
01:51:08.161 --> 01:51:12.332
Whose teeth are rotting,
who's living in shit.


1398
01:51:12.749 --> 01:51:15.544
-And he's my dad.
-Don't do this.


1399
01:51:15.877 --> 01:51:18.880
Don't turn this into your problem.

1400
01:51:19.715 --> 01:51:25.554
Do me a favor. Just pretend
to be a good mother for two minutes.


1401
01:51:25.762 --> 01:51:29.850
Just two minutes
out of your whole life.


1402
01:51:30.058 --> 01:51:32.019
Okay?

1403
01:51:39.735 --> 01:51:41.695
Where are you going?

1404
01:51:41.903 --> 01:51:47.451
You'll have to remember what you
just said as long as you live.


1405
01:51:47.617 --> 01:51:50.620
-I'm not coming after you!
-Good.


1406
01:51:50.787 --> 01:51:52.622
She hasn't changed.

1407
01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:58.170
Everything always happens to her,
no one else.


1408
01:51:58.378 --> 01:52:00.255
Hey, come here.

1409
01:52:04.593 --> 01:52:05.844
Come here.

1410
01:52:13.018 --> 01:52:15.312
I signed that thing, okay?

1411
01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:23.028
I can't give it to you,
she's watching. Don't look.


1412
01:52:23.487 --> 01:52:28.658
I said I came out to take out the
garbage and say goodbye.


1413
01:52:28.825 --> 01:52:31.203
-Right, right, right.
-So....


1414
01:52:32.204 --> 01:52:37.334
Wow, this is probably the last time
I'll ever talk to you.


1415
01:52:38.043 --> 01:52:41.546
I just want to say that....

1416
01:52:41.755 --> 01:52:46.301
I used to feel real bad
about leaving you and all.


1417
01:52:47.302 --> 01:52:52.349
Then, a couple of years ago,
your ma sent me a letter, saying...


1418
01:52:54.518 --> 01:52:56.645
...what a nice kid you were.

1419
01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:00.816
What a good man
you turned out to be.


1420
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:05.404
I'd like to think
I had a lot to do with that.


1421
01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:11.660
-Yeah, okay.
-Even if all I did was stay away...


1422
01:53:12.202 --> 01:53:15.622
...it's still the best thing
I ever did in my life.


1423
01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:25.716
I can't give you the paper.
She's watching us like a hawk.


1424
01:53:26.258 --> 01:53:28.844
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

1425
01:53:29.761 --> 01:53:34.975
So I'm gonna come in
like I'm hugging you.


1426
01:53:35.183 --> 01:53:37.602
I'll slip it in your pocket.

1427
01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:42.065
I'm gonna come in now.
Lift up your arm.


1428
01:53:44.693 --> 01:53:47.487
-It's in.
-All right.


1429
01:53:51.616 --> 01:53:54.953
-Finished throwing out the garbage?
-Yeah.


1430
01:53:56.413 --> 01:53:59.916
-You sure about this?
-What, Shirley?


1431
01:54:00.083 --> 01:54:03.712
She'll get over it.
Women want to forgive.


1432
01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:09.593
Even a total screw-up, they'll help.
It's in their nature.


1433
01:54:10.844 --> 01:54:16.099
You just gotta remember, you gotta
tell them you need their help.


1434
01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:18.602
Or else they won't do it.

1435
01:54:19.811 --> 01:54:23.774
Lord knows, I need
all the help I can get.


1436
01:54:25.817 --> 01:54:27.903
Don't we all?

1437
01:54:32.491 --> 01:54:34.910
Goodbye, son.

1438
01:55:11.154 --> 01:55:15.492
I was a good mother.
No, I was a great mother...


1439
01:55:15.701 --> 01:55:19.287
...for what I went through
to keep you together.


1440
01:55:19.496 --> 01:55:24.710
I'm not asking for thanks,
but don't do this to me, you ingrate.


1441
01:55:26.503 --> 01:55:28.630
Who says I'm in one piece?

1442
01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:33.593
-You're the most normal person I know.
-Normal?


1443
01:55:35.721 --> 01:55:37.222
Normal?

1444
01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:42.686
Amelia was in New York two weeks ago.
She wants me to transfer.


1445
01:55:42.853 --> 01:55:46.523
She wants me to enroll in her school.

1446
01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:49.234
But I can't go.

1447
01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:55.574
I can't leave you.
If something bad happens to you...


1448
01:55:55.866 --> 01:55:58.201
...it's my fault.

1449
01:56:00.996 --> 01:56:06.835
I'm what went wrong with your life.
You know, you wrote a book about it.


1450
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:13.050
I swore I wouldn't--

1451
01:56:13.884 --> 01:56:19.139
Did you know I love Amelia?
Don't worry, she left already.


1452
01:56:19.723 --> 01:56:21.892
Here's the funny thing.

1453
01:56:22.059 --> 01:56:26.396
She thinks I can't love her
because she can't make me happy...


1454
01:56:26.563 --> 01:56:30.400
...and damn it, she's the only
good thing in my life.


1455
01:56:33.904 --> 01:56:36.740
I'm just incredibly screwed up.

1456
01:56:36.907 --> 01:56:40.744
Just so we're real clear about this,
I blame you.


1457
01:56:46.667 --> 01:56:49.544
When does this job ever end?

1458
01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:53.924
You call it a job?

1459
01:56:54.132 --> 01:56:57.219
Well, what do you think it is?
A calling?


1460
01:57:05.185 --> 01:57:07.312
I screwed up.

1461
01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:12.275
I screwed up.

1462
01:57:12.901 --> 01:57:16.196
Come on, don't cry.
I'm sorry.


1463
01:57:17.698 --> 01:57:21.785
I'm sorry.
Look, Ray signed.


1464
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:28.250
I don't care. Just go.

1465
01:57:28.458 --> 01:57:30.585
Just leave me here.

1466
01:57:38.677 --> 01:57:41.179
Mom...

1467
01:57:41.763 --> 01:57:44.224
...I need your help.

1468
01:57:49.187 --> 01:57:51.440
With what?

1469
01:58:04.161 --> 01:58:08.457
Mom, wait.
What about clothes?


1470
01:58:09.041 --> 01:58:12.294
-They sell them in Indiana.
-My apartment?


1471
01:58:14.129 --> 01:58:16.340
I'll take care of it.

1472
01:58:17.674 --> 01:58:21.178
I'll take care of everything.
Just go.


1473
01:58:21.386 --> 01:58:23.847
How will you get home?

1474
01:58:24.014 --> 01:58:27.267
I'll drop you off
and leave tomorrow.


1475
01:58:27.476 --> 01:58:30.562
If you don't go now,
you'll never go.


1476
01:58:32.314 --> 01:58:33.690
I'll be fine here.

1477
01:58:34.232 --> 01:58:38.320
There's a pay phone.
I'll call someone.


1478
01:58:39.696 --> 01:58:42.199
Just go.

1479
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:49.998
Wait.

1480
01:58:55.337 --> 01:58:57.923
Stay there.

1481
01:59:00.008 --> 01:59:03.095
I wanna make something clear.

1482
01:59:03.845 --> 01:59:07.891
I don't think I would've been
better off without you.


1483
01:59:08.225 --> 01:59:12.354
You are not what went wrong
with anything.


1484
01:59:12.854 --> 01:59:15.273
You were what saved me.

1485
01:59:18.276 --> 01:59:21.113
I want to thank you for that.

1486
01:59:25.909 --> 01:59:27.577
Okay?

1487
01:59:32.207 --> 01:59:34.292
You're welcome?

1488
01:59:38.839 --> 01:59:42.342
Now hug me,
or I'll take it all back.


1489
01:59:52.561 --> 01:59:55.230
I love you.

1490
02:00:02.612 --> 02:00:04.239
I love you too.

1491
02:00:21.381 --> 02:00:25.844
Not that it matters, but does Fay
know about you and Amelia?


1492
02:00:27.054 --> 02:00:30.390
She thinks it's great.

1493
02:00:31.308 --> 02:00:35.812
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that. Fay!


1494
02:00:37.814 --> 02:00:41.860
We talked two nights ago.
She didn't say anything.


1495
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:46.573
-Bye, Mom.
-I'm supposed to be her best friend!


1496
02:00:48.533 --> 02:00:51.703
I'll call you from Indiana.

1497
02:01:51.096 --> 02:01:52.305
Cold.

1498
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.392
Sure is.

1499
02:01:57.978 --> 02:02:01.565
-It's okay if I spend the night?
-Yeah.


1500
02:02:03.692 --> 02:02:08.280
Jason blames me for everything
that's happened in his life.


1501
02:02:08.655 --> 02:02:11.742
Can you imagine?
