3
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.550
Ba.

4
00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:41.217
Ba! Ba!

5
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.633
Ba, ba, ba.

6
00:04:46.592 --> 00:04:48.550
- Bye.
- Ba, ba.


7
00:04:51.717 --> 00:04:55.508
A pile of organs without the spark of self
from a brain...


8
00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:57.758
or the pump of blood from a heart.

9
00:04:57.925 --> 00:05:00.758
Just a butcher's tray for a Sunday lunch.

10
00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:05.675
Now, who would like
to reconstruct the organs?


11
00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:10.842
And who can tell human from animal,
if there is a difference?


12
00:05:14.008 --> 00:05:14.842
Come, come.

13
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.883
You did puzzles as children, did you not?

14
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.342
Is it just me, or is it devilishly hard
to concentrate when the monster's talking?


15
00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:26.550
He is an extraordinary surgeon.

16
00:05:26.717 --> 00:05:29.633
His research is groundbreaking.
His father founded this place.


17
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.550
Have you mistaken yourself as included
in this conversation, Max McCandles?


18
00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:36.133
Your physical proximity to us
does not make it so.


19
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.717
Fuck off, old pal. 
Get yourself a suit.

20
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.717
You really think
that's where the liver goes, sir?


21
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.550
Can I ask what is the purpose
of putting them back in, sir?


22
00:05:49.717 --> 00:05:51.300
My amusement.

23
00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:54.217
Mr. Max McCandles!

24
00:05:54.383 --> 00:05:56.675
Walk with me at
the end of the lesson.

25
00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:03.383
Your paper.

26
00:06:04.383 --> 00:06:05.467
You liked it, sir?

27
00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:10.633
It showed signs of a conventional mind
straining hard to almost touch mediocrity.


28
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.467
- Thank you.
- I need someone. An assistant on a project.


29
00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:14.467
I would love to.

30
00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.467
- Are you a religious man?
- I believe in God.


31
00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:20.675
- Me or the deity?
- Humorous, as you're often known as the...


32
00:06:20.842 --> 00:06:22.300
It is a joke of my own making.

33
00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.633
I do not need it explicated for me.

34
00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:26.800
The very devil's work.

35
00:06:26.967 --> 00:06:28.675
Have you thought of growing a beard, sir?

36
00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:30.967
I look like a
big dog in a cravat.

37
00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:32.342
Kids like dogs.

38
00:06:32.967 --> 00:06:34.092
This job.

39
00:06:34.258 --> 00:06:35.633
Yes. Come.

40
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.217
God! God.

41
00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:05.425
God.

42
00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.758
- Hello.
- Hello.


43
00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:12.425
Bella, this is Mr. McCandles.

44
00:07:12.592 --> 00:07:14.050
Hello, Bella.

45
00:07:18.842 --> 00:07:20.258
- Bud.
- Blood.


46
00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:21.675
- Bud.
- Blood.


47
00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.342
- Blood.
- Marvelous.


48
00:07:23.508 --> 00:07:24.717
I'm fine. I'm fine.

49
00:07:29.842 --> 00:07:31.675
What a very pretty retard.

50
00:07:32.425 --> 00:07:35.008
She suffered a brain injury.

51
00:07:35.175 --> 00:07:36.383
I repaired it.

52
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.883
Her mental age and her body
are not quite synchronized.


53
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.300
Language is coming.
She is progressing at an accelerated pace.


54
00:07:45.008 --> 00:07:46.758
She is stunning.

55
00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:50.967
I need to meticulously note her progression.

56
00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:53.133
You will do this for me?

57
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.175
It would be my honor.

58
00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:55.425
Wee!

59
00:07:56.467 --> 00:07:57.342
Wee!

60
00:07:57.508 --> 00:08:00.508
Yes. It is exciting, Bella.

61
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.217
"Wee." I believe she's doing...

62
00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:04.758
Mrs. Prim!

63
00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:07.883
Wee.

64
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.842
Do you not like kippers?

65
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.425
I am quite partial to them, actually.

66
00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:19.050
I find them to
be nice in the morning...

67
00:09:41.508 --> 00:09:42.883
Bella cut, too?

68
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.050
Just dead ones for Bella.

69
00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.050
Just dead.

70
00:09:46.217 --> 00:09:47.383
Just dead.

71
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.883
Just dead.

72
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.342
Squish! Squish, squish.

73
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:14.925
Chog!

74
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.133
Chog!

75
00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:20.217
Run!

76
00:10:23.092 --> 00:10:24.092
Chog.

77
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.133
<i>She gathers 15 words a day.</i>

78
00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:47.633
<i>Her coordination is unstable at best.</i>

79
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.383
<i>In the evenings, there's progress.</i>

80
00:10:50.842 --> 00:10:53.217
<i>Her hair grows one inch every two days.</i>

81
00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:55.383
<i>- I have a hair diagram here.
- Excellent.</i>


82
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.300
You may go. See you tomorrow.

83
00:10:59.217 --> 00:11:01.300
Sir, where did she come from?

84
00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:05.050
I believe your job is collecting data.

85
00:11:05.217 --> 00:11:08.633
When I add inane questions to it,
I'll let you know.


86
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.175
"And so, when they returned from the wood...

87
00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:19.967
"she was reunited with her Mummy and Daddy.

88
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.467
"That night, for dinner,
they ate cake until they were sick.


89
00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:29.675
"They were so happy to be back together."

90
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.467
You me Daddy, God?

91
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.633
- I...
- Prim say you not be.


92
00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:40.092
Bella nowhere girl.

93
00:11:41.383 --> 00:11:43.925
Where that be? Nowhere?

94
00:11:44.758 --> 00:11:46.258
You are an orphan.

95
00:11:46.842 --> 00:11:48.425
Your parents died.

96
00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.508
Then you cut parents up, God?

97
00:11:52.675 --> 00:11:53.550
No.

98
00:11:54.258 --> 00:11:56.092
They were my friends.

99
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:59.633
They were brave explorers...

100
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.717
and they were killed in a landslide
in South America.


101
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.008
They pushed the boundaries
of what was known...


102
00:12:09.175 --> 00:12:10.925
and they paid the price.

103
00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:13.800
But that is the
only way to live, Bella.

104
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.967
They sent you to
me to care for you.

105
00:12:20.383 --> 00:12:21.383
Dead?

106
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.800
I'm afraid so, my darling.

107
00:12:26.675 --> 00:12:28.092
Poor Bella.

108
00:12:30.092 --> 00:12:31.633
But love God.

109
00:12:37.383 --> 00:12:38.758
Sleep here.

110
00:12:40.717 --> 00:12:41.717
No.

111
00:12:52.592 --> 00:12:55.467
Good night, dear Bella.

112
00:12:59.842 --> 00:13:01.550
This, parents.

113
00:13:02.258 --> 00:13:03.675
Peru, yes.

114
00:13:06.092 --> 00:13:08.175
Why you pen book every nut?

115
00:13:08.342 --> 00:13:10.508
I must note down your nutritional intake.

116
00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:17.800
How many?

117
00:13:23.675 --> 00:13:25.883
Tell Bella other places.

118
00:13:26.633 --> 00:13:29.383
That's Lisbon, Portugal.

119
00:13:30.175 --> 00:13:32.300
The south of France. The Alps.

120
00:13:36.592 --> 00:13:37.925
Australia.

121
00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:41.008
Far away and dangerous,
in both people and animal.


122
00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.342
Bella want look at world.

123
00:13:46.133 --> 00:13:47.175
Just...

124
00:13:48.842 --> 00:13:49.967
Bella.

125
00:13:54.008 --> 00:13:57.383
Bella, I don't think we're allowed up here.

126
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.592
Let's just...

127
00:14:13.467 --> 00:14:14.467
Bella.

128
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.550
Bella.

129
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.050
No.

130
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.842
Bella, this is dangerous.

131
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
Bella.

132
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.342
No, Bella.

133
00:15:05.717 --> 00:15:06.633
God.

134
00:15:08.592 --> 00:15:10.300
Outside must go.

135
00:15:11.258 --> 00:15:14.217
Outside? No, we work.

136
00:15:14.883 --> 00:15:15.800
Cut fingers?

137
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.008
Candles take me.
Candles.


138
00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:19.425
Of course I can. If...

139
00:15:19.592 --> 00:15:20.758
No.

140
00:15:20.925 --> 00:15:22.092
Yes. Out!

141
00:15:22.258 --> 00:15:24.008
Has she ever been outside?

142
00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:25.050
No.

143
00:15:25.217 --> 00:15:28.842
I have created a perfectly entertaining
and safe world for Bella.


144
00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:30.383
Now.

145
00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:33.300
- Bella.
- Now!


146
00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:37.342
Now!

147
00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:38.425
Bella.

148
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.717
You know, so many things outside
can kill you, Bella.


149
00:16:09.883 --> 00:16:10.717
Kill dead?

150
00:16:10.883 --> 00:16:14.008
Snakes, carriages, sharp-faced birds,
earthquakes...


151
00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:16.633
inhalation of toxic grass seeds.

152
00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:44.467
Bella.

153
00:16:46.008 --> 00:16:47.008
Bella.

154
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.300
Bella. Look.

155
00:17:20.716 --> 00:17:22.466
- Kill it.
- What?


156
00:17:35.842 --> 00:17:37.717
Why you funny thumbs, God?

157
00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:44.633
Once when I was very small...

158
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.675
my father pinned my thumbs
into a small iron case...


159
00:17:48.842 --> 00:17:51.967
to see whether he could retard
the growth cycle of bones.


160
00:17:53.383 --> 00:17:55.758
Now, the pain was so great...

161
00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:58.050
to stop myself from weeping...

162
00:17:58.217 --> 00:18:01.258
I would stare deeply into my other fingers...

163
00:18:02.258 --> 00:18:04.092
and simply by observation...

164
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.383
begin to parse out
the epidemiological elements.


165
00:18:09.383 --> 00:18:10.800
When he came back...

166
00:18:10.967 --> 00:18:14.092
to his surprise, 
I was smiling.

167
00:18:15.967 --> 00:18:16.925
Good God.

168
00:18:17.092 --> 00:18:20.342
He was a man of unconventional mind.

169
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.633
Time to go.

170
00:18:31.383 --> 00:18:33.675
A storm approaches.

171
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.883
Why must you scare her so?

172
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.258
She's an experiment...

173
00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:43.133
and I must control the conditions...

174
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.550
or our results will not be pure.

175
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.175
Stop!
God, we go!


176
00:19:00.342 --> 00:19:01.300
No, Bella.

177
00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:03.050
Bella want walk in ice cream.

178
00:19:03.217 --> 00:19:04.050
No.

179
00:19:04.217 --> 00:19:05.425
Bella wants!

180
00:19:05.592 --> 00:19:07.925
My face. People scared of God.

181
00:19:08.092 --> 00:19:08.967
Laugh at God.

182
00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:10.425
God lovely.

183
00:19:10.592 --> 00:19:11.925
Like dog face.

184
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.467
Quite.

185
00:19:16.342 --> 00:19:17.758
- Stop! Me walk.
- No!


186
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.050
No now? No never?

187
00:19:23.717 --> 00:19:24.925
Just no.

188
00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:34.842
- Bella!
- No!


189
00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.633
- No! No! No!
- Bella!


190
00:19:39.425 --> 00:19:40.258
No!

191
00:19:44.758 --> 00:19:46.883
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No!


192
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.467
No! No!

193
00:20:02.217 --> 00:20:04.133
I'm sorry, my darling.

194
00:20:06.467 --> 00:20:07.883
Mother of God.

195
00:21:38.258 --> 00:21:39.550
What did you do to her?

196
00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:41.467
Why are you hiding her?

197
00:21:42.008 --> 00:21:44.133
Tell me what all this means,
or I'll go to the police.


198
00:21:47.133 --> 00:21:50.217
I shall. For it is a happy tale.

199
00:22:08.092 --> 00:22:11.925
<i>It is rare to get a body,
albeit dead, but so close to life.</i>


200
00:22:12.092 --> 00:22:14.592
Rigor had not set in.

201
00:22:14.758 --> 00:22:17.258
The body had hardly cooled.

202
00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:19.300
<i>No pulse.</i>

203
00:22:19.883 --> 00:22:22.925
But some electric currents,
so I could have kept her alive.


204
00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:24.342
But you didn't.

205
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.217
<i>I knew nothing of the life
she had abandoned...</i>


206
00:22:28.383 --> 00:22:32.175
<i>except she hated it so much
that she had chosen not to be...</i>


207
00:22:32.342 --> 00:22:33.425
and forever.

208
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.175
What would she feel...

209
00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:40.550
<i>on being dragged
from her carefully chosen blank eternity...</i>


210
00:22:40.717 --> 00:22:43.550
and forced to be put
in one of our understaffed...


211
00:22:43.717 --> 00:22:47.508
poorly-equipped madhouses,
reformatories or jails?


212
00:22:48.633 --> 00:22:53.467
<i>For in this Christian nation,
suicide is treated as lunacy or crime.</i>


213
00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:56.008
<i>Who was I to decide her fate?</i>

214
00:22:56.633 --> 00:23:00.217
But then there was also, on my part,
a recognition.


215
00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:03.342
All my research had come to this moment.

216
00:23:03.508 --> 00:23:06.092
Fate had brought me a dead body...

217
00:23:06.258 --> 00:23:07.258
<i>and a live infant.</i>

218
00:23:07.425 --> 00:23:08.675
It was obvious.

219
00:23:08.842 --> 00:23:09.758
It was?

220
00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:11.425
Take the infant's brain out...

221
00:23:11.592 --> 00:23:14.842
and put it in the full-grown woman,
reanimate her, and watch.


222
00:23:15.467 --> 00:23:16.717
Jesus!

223
00:24:09.217 --> 00:24:10.592
She knows?

224
00:24:10.758 --> 00:24:12.008
No.

225
00:24:12.175 --> 00:24:13.050
Who was she?

226
00:24:13.592 --> 00:24:14.675
No idea.

227
00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:19.008
But would you rather
the world did not have Bella?


228
00:26:58.675 --> 00:26:59.758
Mrs. Prim?

229
00:27:00.633 --> 00:27:02.633
Bella discover happy when she want.

230
00:27:04.633 --> 00:27:06.842
You are a sour
face, but I fix you.

231
00:27:08.342 --> 00:27:09.467
Close eyes.

232
00:27:12.175 --> 00:27:14.967
- No!
- Just wait. It takes a moment.


233
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.467
She grabbed my hairy business.

234
00:27:18.925 --> 00:27:19.925
She's sick!

235
00:27:20.092 --> 00:27:20.925
Bella.

236
00:27:21.092 --> 00:27:23.133
Bella have discover something I must share.

237
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.133
Watch.

238
00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:27.133
- What if put cucumber in me?
- No.


239
00:27:28.675 --> 00:27:30.425
Bella! Bella!

240
00:27:31.258 --> 00:27:33.550
Cease working yourself immediately.

241
00:27:33.717 --> 00:27:34.550
What?

242
00:27:34.717 --> 00:27:37.592
In polite society, that is not done.

243
00:27:42.133 --> 00:27:44.050
Just do not.

244
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.675
What... is that?

245
00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:59.550
My father took out
my oxyntic and pyloric glands...


246
00:27:59.717 --> 00:28:02.258
so I must make my own gastric juices.

247
00:28:02.842 --> 00:28:04.175
Why in God's name would he do that?

248
00:28:04.342 --> 00:28:06.758
To discover what no one knew.

249
00:28:06.925 --> 00:28:09.550
Turns out we need them. Ideally.

250
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.342
Bella...

251
00:28:13.383 --> 00:28:14.800
you have not eaten.

252
00:28:16.133 --> 00:28:17.758
Do not.

253
00:28:26.133 --> 00:28:27.300
Good night.

254
00:28:28.758 --> 00:28:29.758
'Night.

255
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.175
You know, I'm actually
something of a romantic, Max.


256
00:28:52.758 --> 00:28:53.717
What?

257
00:28:53.883 --> 00:28:56.550
I believe I see
love between you and Bella.

258
00:28:58.217 --> 00:28:59.508
I... She is...

259
00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:02.133
Perhaps you should marry her.

260
00:29:02.467 --> 00:29:03.300
What?

261
00:29:03.467 --> 00:29:04.800
I think she loves you.

262
00:29:07.175 --> 00:29:10.425
<i>I've seen people look at each other
with love...</i>


263
00:29:10.592 --> 00:29:11.633
<i>as an observer.</i>

264
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.925
<i>Not the subject, of course. I see it.</i>

265
00:29:15.383 --> 00:29:16.383
<i>You do?</i>

266
00:29:18.092 --> 00:29:18.925
<i>I...</i>

267
00:29:19.467 --> 00:29:22.258
I do have feelings for her.

268
00:29:22.425 --> 00:29:23.967
So, you would?

269
00:29:24.758 --> 00:29:26.717
Take Bella out.

270
00:29:27.967 --> 00:29:29.008
Bella...

271
00:29:31.008 --> 00:29:31.883
I...

272
00:29:34.758 --> 00:29:35.758
Feel funny?

273
00:29:42.383 --> 00:29:43.217
Do Bella.

274
00:29:49.508 --> 00:29:51.383
<i>I was wondering...</i>

275
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.967
if perhaps you were raising her
to be your mistress.


276
00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:56.467
A dark thought unworthy of me, I know.

277
00:29:57.717 --> 00:30:00.883
So, you are not laying with her?

278
00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:06.258
Spermatic ejaculation can only induce
homeostasis in me...


279
00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:10.425
if accompanied by prolonged stimulation
of higher nerve centers...


280
00:30:10.592 --> 00:30:14.508
whose pressure on the ductless glands
changes the chemistry of my blood...


281
00:30:14.675 --> 00:30:16.800
not for a few spasmodic minutes...

282
00:30:16.967 --> 00:30:18.300
but for many days.

283
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.675
What?

284
00:30:20.842 --> 00:30:23.092
I am a eunuch and can't fuck her.

285
00:30:23.467 --> 00:30:26.300
To get a sexual response from my body...

286
00:30:26.467 --> 00:30:30.133
would take the same amount of electricity
as runs North London.


287
00:30:30.842 --> 00:30:33.550
Besides, my paternal feelings...

288
00:30:33.717 --> 00:30:36.092
seem to outweigh my sexual thoughts.

289
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.425
<i>I apologize for my own dark thoughts.</i>

290
00:30:40.592 --> 00:30:41.633
<i>Not dark at all.</i>

291
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.967
<i>Men's, indeed all sexuality,
is basically immoral.</i>


292
00:30:46.133 --> 00:30:47.925
<i>Not all, sir.</i>

293
00:30:48.092 --> 00:30:49.883
<i>Do you wish to marry her or not?</i>

294
00:30:51.425 --> 00:30:54.133
I wish to marry you. Be my wife.

295
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.508
Let us touch each other's genital pieces.

296
00:31:04.675 --> 00:31:06.092
No. No.

297
00:31:06.258 --> 00:31:08.342
I do not wish
to take advantage of you.

298
00:31:08.508 --> 00:31:09.633
You are special.

299
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.467
When we are wed.

300
00:31:18.383 --> 00:31:19.425
One condition.

301
00:31:19.592 --> 00:31:22.217
She must desire it also, I understand.

302
00:31:22.383 --> 00:31:23.925
Two conditions, then.

303
00:31:24.092 --> 00:31:25.300
That one you said...

304
00:31:25.467 --> 00:31:29.300
and you must live here with me, always.

305
00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:33.300
<i>I will have a legal agreement drawn up.</i>

306
00:31:59.675 --> 00:32:00.717
Curious contract.

307
00:32:00.883 --> 00:32:02.800
There are several spelling errors.

308
00:32:03.842 --> 00:32:07.133
Immaterial to the legal bindingness of it,
I assure you.


309
00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:13.050
Must be quite a woman
to warrant such binding.


310
00:32:17.883 --> 00:32:20.050
If you'll excuse me,
I need to use the facilities.


311
00:32:21.842 --> 00:32:24.508
Are you five years old
that you can't hold your water?


312
00:32:24.925 --> 00:32:29.175
Weak bladder, sir.
Like my father before me and his before him.


313
00:32:29.342 --> 00:32:31.758
You may have prostate cancer. Look into it.

314
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.550
Will do.

315
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.550
Ms. Bella Baxter, as per your contract,
no doubt.


316
00:33:43.342 --> 00:33:45.300
Good afternoon, visiting man.

317
00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:47.342
Want my hat?

318
00:33:48.175 --> 00:33:49.467
Would it suit me?

319
00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:51.133
Yes.

320
00:33:52.425 --> 00:33:54.133
It is foolish good.

321
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.425
I had to meet this woman...

322
00:33:55.592 --> 00:33:59.217
who would inspire such a contract of marriage
that imprisons her.


323
00:34:00.133 --> 00:34:01.300
What you mean?

324
00:34:01.467 --> 00:34:02.425
You shall live here...

325
00:34:02.592 --> 00:34:05.883
travel with Mr. Max McCandles
and Baxter abroad...


326
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.925
but not go forth in the city.

327
00:34:08.508 --> 00:34:09.758
I see.

328
00:34:10.883 --> 00:34:12.133
They love me tight.

329
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.800
I understand why.

330
00:34:14.258 --> 00:34:16.008
I have to pinch you,
to see if you are real.

331
00:34:16.175 --> 00:34:17.175
You will not...

332
00:34:20.842 --> 00:34:22.050
Who is you?

333
00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800
Mr. Duncan Wedderburn.

334
00:34:57.675 --> 00:34:58.508
Open.

335
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.342
How you get up here?

336
00:35:12.633 --> 00:35:13.550
I climbed.

337
00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:33.842
You were watch me long?

338
00:35:34.008 --> 00:35:35.300
Not long.

339
00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:38.883
You did not see me working on myself
to get happiness, did you?


340
00:35:39.967 --> 00:35:42.008
It is not polites, I know.

341
00:35:47.175 --> 00:35:49.383
Do not care for polite society.

342
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.675
It's fucking boring.

343
00:35:51.467 --> 00:35:52.800
Destroys one's soul.

344
00:35:53.925 --> 00:35:55.425
God not believe in soul.

345
00:35:56.883 --> 00:36:00.092
I think God's the actual author
of the soul idea.


346
00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:02.133
Godwin Baxter?

347
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.092
That burnt dog.

348
00:36:04.258 --> 00:36:05.800
What is that story?

349
00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:09.217
You are a prisoner and
I aim to free you.

350
00:36:11.592 --> 00:36:14.175
Something in you, some hungry being...

351
00:36:14.342 --> 00:36:17.050
hungry for experience, freedom, touch.

352
00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:19.300
To see the unknown and know it.

353
00:36:20.092 --> 00:36:22.425
So, why am I here, you ask?

354
00:36:23.592 --> 00:36:26.633
I'm going to Lisbon on Friday.
I'd like you to come.


355
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.425
Lisbon of Portugal?

356
00:36:28.592 --> 00:36:30.633
That is the Lisbon I speak of.

357
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.550
God never allow it.

358
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:37.758
That's why I'm not asking him.

359
00:36:39.425 --> 00:36:40.633
I'm asking you.

360
00:36:42.842 --> 00:36:45.008
Bella not safe with you, I think.

361
00:36:45.175 --> 00:36:48.342
You are absolutely... not.

362
00:37:03.383 --> 00:37:06.758
May I have a moment
of value time, dear God?

363
00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:08.217
Of course, Bella.

364
00:37:08.383 --> 00:37:10.967
I wanted to tell you big news.

365
00:37:11.133 --> 00:37:13.217
Bella is dizzy with excite.

366
00:37:13.633 --> 00:37:14.508
What is it?

367
00:37:14.675 --> 00:37:16.467
Tonight, at midnight...

368
00:37:17.217 --> 00:37:20.758
I secretly run away
with one Duncan Wedderburn.


369
00:37:20.925 --> 00:37:21.967
What?

370
00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:23.425
You will wish to stop me.

371
00:37:23.592 --> 00:37:24.592
I shall stop you.

372
00:37:24.758 --> 00:37:26.508
You hold Bella too tight.

373
00:37:27.217 --> 00:37:28.925
I must set forth into waters.

374
00:37:29.092 --> 00:37:30.092
We can travel.

375
00:37:30.258 --> 00:37:33.050
You, me, and Max whom,
I will remind you...


376
00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:34.508
you are betrothed to.

377
00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:36.342
I will marry Max...

378
00:37:36.508 --> 00:37:39.008
as he seems right for that...

379
00:37:39.175 --> 00:37:42.842
but first, I shall adventure
on Duncan Wedderburn...


380
00:37:43.008 --> 00:37:46.633
who, I think, cares
little of damage to me...

381
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.383
but will be interesting as well.

382
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.050
I can't let you go.

383
00:37:58.883 --> 00:38:00.842
Kiss me and set me forth.

384
00:38:01.717 --> 00:38:02.800
If you do not...

385
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.217
Bella's insides shall turn rotten with hate.

386
00:38:07.383 --> 00:38:09.592
- Hate?
- Hate.


387
00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:19.967
Unpack those bags, Prim.

388
00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:22.008
Godwin has told me your plan.

389
00:38:22.175 --> 00:38:23.300
I do not blame you, Bella.

390
00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.217
That man is a cad and a rake.

391
00:38:25.383 --> 00:38:28.175
He has insidious ways
of getting under a naive woman's skin.


392
00:38:28.342 --> 00:38:30.758
It is mostly his eyes on mine.

393
00:38:30.925 --> 00:38:33.675
And his hands when between Bella's legs...

394
00:38:34.175 --> 00:38:36.258
and whisper words I can't hear...

395
00:38:36.425 --> 00:38:38.342
but heat in my body.

396
00:38:38.508 --> 00:38:39.883
Jesus, Bella.

397
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.425
We are engaged.

398
00:38:41.592 --> 00:38:42.342
I love you.

399
00:38:42.508 --> 00:38:44.550
And when I return, we marriage...

400
00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:46.842
and be happy as
two doves on a branch.

401
00:38:47.008 --> 00:38:48.758
- You think I need travel hat?
- No!


402
00:38:49.425 --> 00:38:50.342
This will not do.

403
00:38:50.925 --> 00:38:52.258
It cannot!

404
00:38:52.425 --> 00:38:53.717
I'll see to this man myself.

405
00:38:54.425 --> 00:38:58.258
I will beat his handsome face
into a porridge of blood and bones!


406
00:38:58.425 --> 00:39:00.133
Max, you are flushed...

407
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.592
and I am too
at sight of different Max.

408
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.508
I apologize...

409
00:39:03.717 --> 00:39:07.050
but I will not let a man that I know
has nothing but ill intent in his mind...


410
00:39:07.217 --> 00:39:09.758
and nothing for you
in his heart trick you.

411
00:39:09.925 --> 00:39:12.717
I will smash his fucking head in.

412
00:39:28.133 --> 00:39:29.342
Bella? It...

413
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.717
Bella.

414
00:39:43.008 --> 00:39:45.383
Goodbye, later dove.

415
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.133
I will see you after grand adventure.

416
00:39:50.258 --> 00:39:51.092
God?

417
00:40:31.925 --> 00:40:32.842
She's gone.

418
00:40:33.883 --> 00:40:36.383
I am having port for breakfast.

419
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.508
It is strangely delicious.

420
00:40:38.675 --> 00:40:40.342
Why did you not stop her?

421
00:40:41.342 --> 00:40:43.508
She is a being of free will.

422
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.925
She's now out there. Alone.

423
00:40:50.092 --> 00:40:51.967
She will be fine.

424
00:40:52.133 --> 00:40:54.092
I'm a fool. I should have stopped her.

425
00:40:54.258 --> 00:40:56.217
We are men of science.

426
00:40:57.258 --> 00:41:00.842
This emotionality is unseemly.

427
00:41:04.425 --> 00:41:05.967
I just hope she's all right.

428
00:41:28.258 --> 00:41:30.633
You are the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.


429
00:41:31.383 --> 00:41:33.217
I will not lie, 
I have been with many.

430
00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:37.050
Mrs. Prim said you were wolf
with scent of hundred women on you.


431
00:41:37.217 --> 00:41:38.592
She undersells it.

432
00:41:39.217 --> 00:41:41.717
Okay. Oysters.

433
00:41:41.883 --> 00:41:43.467
Have you had them before?

434
00:41:43.633 --> 00:41:44.800
I have not.

435
00:41:49.175 --> 00:41:51.092
Shuck, chuck and bubble.

436
00:42:02.092 --> 00:42:03.008
Rollicking.

437
00:42:06.592 --> 00:42:07.758
Rollicking.

438
00:42:11.508 --> 00:42:12.675
Wait. Bella.

439
00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.008
So, nuns and monks would
starch their clothes with egg whites...


440
00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:27.342
and, with the yolks, make these tarts.

441
00:42:27.967 --> 00:42:29.050
Now, how to eat them?

442
00:42:29.217 --> 00:42:30.842
I will guess through the mouth.

443
00:42:31.008 --> 00:42:33.925
They must not be eaten
dainty flake by dainty flake...


444
00:42:34.092 --> 00:42:36.967
but inhaled with gusto, like life itself.

445
00:42:43.425 --> 00:42:44.717
Incredible.

446
00:42:45.842 --> 00:42:47.717
Who made these?
We need more.


447
00:42:47.967 --> 00:42:50.425
No more. One's enough.
Any more is too much.


448
00:42:51.425 --> 00:42:52.758
It's siesta time.

449
00:42:52.925 --> 00:42:54.508
What is siesta?

450
00:43:21.383 --> 00:43:23.842
Why do people not just do this...

451
00:43:24.008 --> 00:43:25.300
all the time?

452
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.133
Well, at the risk of being immodest...

453
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.133
you've just been thrice fucked
by the very best.


454
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.092
It's probable no other man
would ever bring you to the raptures I have.


455
00:43:36.842 --> 00:43:38.008
I feel bad for you.

456
00:43:39.592 --> 00:43:43.092
Well, then it will just be you
I do furious jumping with.


457
00:43:43.967 --> 00:43:45.467
Furious jumping?

458
00:43:46.133 --> 00:43:47.217
I love that.

459
00:43:47.633 --> 00:43:49.050
I'm rested.

460
00:43:49.842 --> 00:43:50.883
Let us go again.

461
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.175
Again?

462
00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:54.425
Unfortunately...

463
00:43:54.592 --> 00:43:56.133
even I have my limits.

464
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.592
Men cannot keep coming back for more.

465
00:43:58.758 --> 00:44:00.967
It is a physiological problem?

466
00:44:01.717 --> 00:44:03.175
A weakness in men?

467
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:05.550
Well...

468
00:44:07.883 --> 00:44:09.342
Perhaps so.

469
00:44:10.883 --> 00:44:12.842
You'd be advised,
if it's not too late...


470
00:44:13.008 --> 00:44:14.758
not to fall in love with me.

471
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:16.883
I have very little to offer...

472
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:18.758
in the way of constancy.

473
00:44:18.967 --> 00:44:20.092
Just adventure.

474
00:44:20.258 --> 00:44:21.425
I see.

475
00:44:22.967 --> 00:44:24.092
Let us sleep.

476
00:44:52.842 --> 00:44:53.842
Taxi, madam?

477
00:48:34.508 --> 00:48:35.467
Good evening...

478
00:48:37.383 --> 00:48:38.258
Duncan Wedderburn.

479
00:48:38.758 --> 00:48:40.800
Bella, where were you? 
You disappeared.

480
00:48:41.508 --> 00:48:42.717
I did not.

481
00:48:43.467 --> 00:48:45.425
Nobody can just disappear.

482
00:48:45.925 --> 00:48:46.883
What?

483
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.675
Can they? Disappear?

484
00:48:48.842 --> 00:48:51.842
No, of course not.
What the fuck are you talking...


485
00:48:52.008 --> 00:48:52.925
Where were you?

486
00:48:53.092 --> 00:48:56.758
I wanted a tart
and then an adventure befell me.


487
00:48:56.925 --> 00:48:59.842
I did not know how to return
and then I heard it.


488
00:49:00.008 --> 00:49:00.842
The tram.

489
00:49:01.008 --> 00:49:03.758
I will walk to the
noise, and I found it.

490
00:49:03.925 --> 00:49:05.425
Amazement to Bella.

491
00:49:05.592 --> 00:49:07.050
Explorer bloods in me.

492
00:49:07.633 --> 00:49:09.092
Bella, it's dangerous to go out without me.

493
00:49:09.258 --> 00:49:12.508
I have adventured it
and found nothing but sugar and violence.


494
00:49:12.675 --> 00:49:14.175
It is most charming.

495
00:49:14.342 --> 00:49:15.425
I am fine.

496
00:49:16.092 --> 00:49:20.092
Now, I must lie down and you must lie down
on top of me and do more furious jumping.


497
00:49:24.217 --> 00:49:25.008
Kitty.

498
00:49:26.217 --> 00:49:28.592
Did you see the new
show in London by Wilde?

499
00:49:28.758 --> 00:49:29.967
Marvelously witty.

500
00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:31.258
I loved it.

501
00:49:31.425 --> 00:49:33.008
"A handbag."

502
00:49:37.717 --> 00:49:38.675
Bella.

503
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:41.008
What?

504
00:49:42.342 --> 00:49:45.175
Why I keep it in
my mouth if it is revolting?

505
00:49:45.758 --> 00:49:47.925
I have said that before to Gerald.

506
00:49:49.633 --> 00:49:51.717
If you catch my drift.

507
00:49:53.008 --> 00:49:54.300
You are wicked.

508
00:49:54.467 --> 00:49:56.508
Oh. Because you mean his penis.

509
00:49:58.883 --> 00:50:00.758
Duncan's can sometimes be salty.

510
00:50:04.675 --> 00:50:05.758
Good God, Bella.

511
00:50:07.758 --> 00:50:09.300
I must go punch that baby.

512
00:50:14.008 --> 00:50:14.842
Bella.

513
00:50:19.758 --> 00:50:22.050
Your behavior is unconscionable.

514
00:50:22.217 --> 00:50:23.342
Will you behave?

515
00:50:23.508 --> 00:50:25.675
The food was cacking my throat...

516
00:50:25.842 --> 00:50:27.342
the baby annoying...

517
00:50:27.508 --> 00:50:29.758
and the woman boring with words.

518
00:50:29.925 --> 00:50:31.092
You will rejoin the table...

519
00:50:31.258 --> 00:50:34.050
and will confine yourself
to the following three phrases...


520
00:50:34.217 --> 00:50:36.383
"How marvelous!", "Delighted"...

521
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:40.175
and "How did they make the pastry so crisp?"
Yes?


522
00:50:40.842 --> 00:50:42.300
You are hurting Bella.

523
00:50:42.467 --> 00:50:43.717
Sorry.

524
00:50:43.883 --> 00:50:45.842
Reason does not penetrate.

525
00:50:46.008 --> 00:50:46.800
Let us go.

526
00:51:04.383 --> 00:51:06.883
Are you enjoying Lisbon, Bella?

527
00:51:09.008 --> 00:51:09.967
Delighted.

528
00:51:12.092 --> 00:51:14.550
Kitty, how is your dear father?

529
00:51:15.133 --> 00:51:16.050
He's very unwell.

530
00:51:16.758 --> 00:51:18.550
I fear he will
not see the year out.

531
00:51:18.925 --> 00:51:20.008
How marvelous.

532
00:51:20.633 --> 00:51:22.592
How did they get the pastry so crisp?

533
00:51:41.633 --> 00:51:42.800
Good God.

534
00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:44.717
What is it?

535
00:51:45.842 --> 00:51:46.925
From her.

536
00:51:50.258 --> 00:51:52.675
"Me good. Lisbon.

537
00:51:53.175 --> 00:51:56.133
"Sugar tart lick me all day."

538
00:51:57.675 --> 00:51:59.633
At least I hope
that's all one sentence, anyway.


539
00:52:00.092 --> 00:52:00.842
- Do you think they're...
- Fucking?


540
00:52:01.008 --> 00:52:01.842
Yes.

541
00:52:03.467 --> 00:52:04.258
Also...

542
00:52:04.967 --> 00:52:06.342
fellating a tram.

543
00:53:19.092 --> 00:53:22.342
Does your head ache too, 
Duncan Wedderburn?

544
00:53:22.508 --> 00:53:24.967
And I also am starving for dinner.

545
00:53:25.133 --> 00:53:26.717
Where the fuck were you?

546
00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.842
Victoria Blessington?

547
00:53:33.342 --> 00:53:35.217
I haven't seen you for years.

548
00:53:35.383 --> 00:53:37.175
And you still have not...

549
00:53:37.342 --> 00:53:39.675
as I am Bella Baxter...

550
00:53:39.842 --> 00:53:41.550
strange feathered lady.

551
00:53:41.717 --> 00:53:44.467
I apologize. I could've sworn you were she.

552
00:53:49.467 --> 00:53:50.467
Right.

553
00:53:50.633 --> 00:53:51.842
Shall we?

554
00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:55.258
The steak, the fish...

555
00:53:55.425 --> 00:53:57.550
little caramel things in pots...

556
00:53:57.717 --> 00:54:00.133
that old spotted people over there have.

557
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.967
I don't want caramel in pots.

558
00:54:02.342 --> 00:54:04.550
Of course not. 
That was all for Bella.

559
00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:06.175
Order at your whim.

560
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:10.675
You are cross
at Bella's outings and adventures.


561
00:54:10.842 --> 00:54:13.008
And yet we must discover by whim...

562
00:54:13.175 --> 00:54:16.050
as spoken by Duncan Wedderburn
to Bella Baxter...


563
00:54:16.258 --> 00:54:17.758
day one of Lisbon love affair.

564
00:54:18.592 --> 00:54:19.342
Touché.

565
00:54:19.508 --> 00:54:21.800
Understand me never lived
outside God's house.


566
00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:22.675
What?

567
00:54:22.842 --> 00:54:25.217
So, Bella so much to discover...

568
00:54:25.383 --> 00:54:27.550
and your sad face...

569
00:54:28.008 --> 00:54:31.050
makes me discover angry feelings for you.

570
00:54:32.758 --> 00:54:33.633
Right.

571
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.133
I have become the very thing I hate...

572
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.675
a grasping succubus of a lover.

573
00:54:41.258 --> 00:54:43.592
I've pried many of them off me
and now I'm it.


574
00:54:44.133 --> 00:54:44.967
Fuck!

575
00:55:52.467 --> 00:55:55.508
You, like me, are a creature of freedom
in the moments.


576
00:55:58.508 --> 00:55:59.758
What do you keep doing that for?

577
00:56:00.842 --> 00:56:03.008
A man over there repeated blinks at me.

578
00:56:03.925 --> 00:56:05.342
I blink back.

579
00:56:05.508 --> 00:56:06.883
For polites, I think.

580
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.758
We are going to dance in town.
Please join us.


581
00:56:21.925 --> 00:56:24.008
I have never danced in town.

582
00:56:36.675 --> 00:56:38.300
- Duncan!
- Can't!


583
00:56:52.467 --> 00:56:53.300
You're quite mad.

584
00:56:53.467 --> 00:56:56.383
Stop talking
as your sounds make Bella angry!


585
00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:57.800
I will not stop talking.

586
00:56:57.967 --> 00:56:58.967
If I have something to say I'll...

587
00:56:59.133 --> 00:57:00.050
Ouch.

588
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:08.842
All right.

589
00:57:12.925 --> 00:57:13.675
What's this?

590
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.342
A man was teaching me chess...

591
00:57:19.508 --> 00:57:24.133
and he said he thought I would probably have
the softest skin he had ever touched.


592
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:28.717
And I said, if I did it would be
the inner thighs to test...


593
00:57:28.883 --> 00:57:32.050
as that is where the epidermis
is at its most fine.


594
00:57:32.217 --> 00:57:33.300
So we tested...

595
00:57:33.467 --> 00:57:35.550
and it was the softest ever.

596
00:57:36.342 --> 00:57:39.633
I wondered if perhaps
they're not equal in softitude.


597
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.258
Indeed they were not.

598
00:57:41.425 --> 00:57:44.467
So I made sure to note it,
remembering which was which.


599
00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.050
What of the tongue play
you were about to perform?


600
00:57:58.008 --> 00:57:59.592
Is that not happening?

601
00:58:17.758 --> 00:58:18.800
You...

602
00:58:21.342 --> 00:58:22.592
You are troubled.

603
00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:25.342
Did he lie with you?

604
00:58:26.175 --> 00:58:27.842
No, we were against a wall.

605
00:58:28.842 --> 00:58:30.467
Did you furious jump him?

606
00:58:30.633 --> 00:58:33.800
No, he just fast-licked my clitoris.

607
00:58:33.967 --> 00:58:37.717
I had the heat that needed release,
so at my request it was.


608
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:43.217
You, too, may tongue play me...

609
00:58:43.383 --> 00:58:48.217
so I'm not understanding
this complicated feeling.


610
00:58:51.467 --> 00:58:53.008
Are you now crying?

611
00:59:01.508 --> 00:59:05.467
What a confusing person you are,
Duncan Wedderburn.


612
00:59:05.633 --> 00:59:06.925
A liver.

613
00:59:16.467 --> 00:59:19.175
A small incision...

614
00:59:19.758 --> 00:59:22.925
is all that is needed.

615
00:59:36.842 --> 00:59:38.800
I was chloroforming goats all morning.

616
00:59:38.967 --> 00:59:41.383
I may have ingested too much.

617
00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:46.425
I am going to venture to suggest
you are upset by Bella's absence.


618
00:59:46.592 --> 00:59:48.217
The liters of port...

619
00:59:48.383 --> 00:59:49.967
the sobbing I hear at night.

620
00:59:50.133 --> 00:59:53.008
Good God, man! 
You prattle like an imbecile.

621
00:59:53.175 --> 00:59:54.467
She is gone!

622
00:59:55.842 --> 00:59:57.717
I am a man of science.

623
00:59:57.883 --> 01:00:00.967
I just need to engage in,
and continue, the project.


624
01:00:01.133 --> 01:00:04.133
That is all.
I must go on to the next thing.


625
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.675
Our feelings must be put aside.

626
01:00:07.508 --> 01:00:10.383
Do you think my father
could have branded me...


627
01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:13.258
with hot irons on the genitals
the way he did...


628
01:00:13.425 --> 01:00:16.508
if he could not put
science and progress first?


629
01:00:16.675 --> 01:00:17.425
Branded you?

630
01:00:19.967 --> 01:00:22.133
Let us find a body.

631
01:00:23.467 --> 01:00:24.717
A what?

632
01:00:47.883 --> 01:00:49.050
Hello. Good morning.

633
01:00:51.717 --> 01:00:53.175
Good morning, darling.

634
01:00:57.592 --> 01:01:00.800
I haven't been very supportive
of your adventurous spirit.


635
01:01:00.967 --> 01:01:02.592
So I have a surprise for you.

636
01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:12.092
Get in.

637
01:01:26.508 --> 01:01:29.425
- We changed hotels?
- Look out the window, Bella.


638
01:01:41.133 --> 01:01:43.050
- We're on boat?
- Indeed.


639
01:01:44.258 --> 01:01:48.467
- You aim to trap Bella at sea.
- I aim to give you a new adventure.


640
01:01:48.633 --> 01:01:51.175
I suppose it's true
you'll be easier to find.

641
01:01:51.342 --> 01:01:53.883
Come, disrobe me.

642
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:55.008
Ride me.

643
01:01:55.925 --> 01:01:58.383
And we'll then have cocktails on foredeck.

644
01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:18.342
Bella.

645
01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:23.383
Bella.

646
01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:28.925
Bella.

647
01:02:30.092 --> 01:02:30.967
Bella!

648
01:02:31.925 --> 01:02:34.425
Blue. Blue. Blue.

649
01:04:13.633 --> 01:04:14.758
Shit on me?

650
01:04:15.342 --> 01:04:16.133
Fucker!

651
01:04:20.883 --> 01:04:21.800
Madam.

652
01:04:23.592 --> 01:04:25.092
When do we stop?

653
01:04:26.633 --> 01:04:28.467
Athens. Three days.

654
01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:58.967
That woman's on fire, look.

655
01:05:02.008 --> 01:05:03.217
I know you're upset with me.

656
01:05:03.383 --> 01:05:06.175
Forgive my kidnapping of you,
but it was for love.


657
01:05:06.342 --> 01:05:08.592
A romantic jape.
Don't be such a cunt about it.


658
01:05:09.592 --> 01:05:12.050
- I want a drink.
- Of course, my darling.


659
01:05:12.217 --> 01:05:15.425
The ship is fun,
a whole world to explore.

660
01:05:16.342 --> 01:05:18.133
Do you love me? I love you.

661
01:05:19.342 --> 01:05:23.425
Describe the elements I should be looking for
within myself to be sure.


662
01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:25.967
You just feel it or not.

663
01:05:26.133 --> 01:05:29.717
So it is no evidence
base, as God would say.

664
01:05:30.467 --> 01:05:33.092
- So how judge it empirically?
- What the fuck are you talking about?


665
01:05:33.258 --> 01:05:34.217
Who are you?

666
01:05:34.383 --> 01:05:37.008
You don't know what bananas are,
you've never heard of chess...


667
01:05:37.175 --> 01:05:38.800
and yet you know what "empirically" means.

668
01:05:38.967 --> 01:05:41.550
Bella wants a drink. 
I said twice now.

669
01:05:41.717 --> 01:05:44.175
I've never felt anything like this.

670
01:05:44.342 --> 01:05:45.758
Is this true for you?

671
01:05:47.842 --> 01:05:49.508
I suppose, empirically it is.

672
01:05:53.133 --> 01:05:55.008
I'm out of ink.

673
01:05:59.925 --> 01:06:01.425
Then ink you shall have, my love.

674
01:06:14.592 --> 01:06:17.133
Hello, interesting older lady.

675
01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.925
I must touch your hair.

676
01:06:21.342 --> 01:06:23.050
I also noticed your hair.

677
01:06:23.217 --> 01:06:27.217
Just like silk on a translucent, glowing egg.

678
01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:30.258
That is fancy words that excite me somehow.

679
01:06:30.425 --> 01:06:33.258
I saw you're with handsome over there.

680
01:06:33.425 --> 01:06:35.550
White teeth and a hard cock.

681
01:06:36.758 --> 01:06:38.092
Duncan Wedderburn.

682
01:06:38.258 --> 01:06:41.592
His teeth are also hard.
His penis is also white.


683
01:06:41.758 --> 01:06:43.717
- Good lay, I hope.
- He is my only.


684
01:06:43.883 --> 01:06:48.217
But I find him to elicit exceptional
sensations throughout my whole body...


685
01:06:48.383 --> 01:06:50.550
that leave me yelping happily.

686
01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:54.633
I also wish to dash his body, form, cadaver,
into the sea.


687
01:06:55.258 --> 01:06:56.592
Is this man jumping on your body?

688
01:06:57.175 --> 01:06:58.508
No, he is not.

689
01:06:58.675 --> 01:07:00.675
I haven't been bedded in 20 years.

690
01:07:00.842 --> 01:07:01.800
What?

691
01:07:02.467 --> 01:07:03.633
That is terrible.

692
01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.633
It doesn't concern me greatly.

693
01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.800
As years have passed...

694
01:07:07.967 --> 01:07:10.592
what's in between my ears
is my big concern.


695
01:07:11.175 --> 01:07:13.133
What's in between my legs...

696
01:07:14.633 --> 01:07:15.717
much less so.

697
01:07:15.883 --> 01:07:18.133
A desperate rationalization, Martha.

698
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.508
Oh, this is Harry Astley.

699
01:07:20.675 --> 01:07:23.717
Don't take what he
says too much to heart.

700
01:07:24.175 --> 01:07:25.300
He's a cynic.

701
01:07:25.883 --> 01:07:26.967
Madam.

702
01:07:27.467 --> 01:07:29.050
I am Bella Baxter.

703
01:07:30.008 --> 01:07:32.342
I do not know what this "cynic" is.

704
01:07:32.508 --> 01:07:33.300
Bella.

705
01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:34.925
Ink.

706
01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:39.217
Duncan Wedderburn,
I have made friends, colleagues, comrades.


707
01:07:39.383 --> 01:07:40.842
Harry Astley.

708
01:07:41.008 --> 01:07:42.508
This is Martha.

709
01:07:42.675 --> 01:07:45.800
She is my new friend who has not been fucked
in 20 years.


710
01:07:45.967 --> 01:07:47.550
Is that not astonishment?

711
01:07:47.717 --> 01:07:51.175
I hope you use your hand between your legs
to keep yourself happy.


712
01:07:51.342 --> 01:07:54.800
Good God, Bella,
you cannot speak like this.


713
01:07:54.967 --> 01:07:57.050
Polites of society. I forgot.

714
01:07:57.217 --> 01:07:58.675
Polite society...

715
01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.258
will destroy you.

716
01:08:00.425 --> 01:08:02.550
- It will?
- Yeah, there's some truth to that.


717
01:08:02.717 --> 01:08:04.508
We all agreed on that.

718
01:08:04.675 --> 01:08:07.008
As to your enquiry on my hand.

719
01:08:07.175 --> 01:08:09.008
Occasionally, yes.

720
01:08:09.175 --> 01:08:11.425
That is much reassuring news.

721
01:08:12.258 --> 01:08:14.758
- We shall all dine together.
- Well, actually...


722
01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:17.467
We are all on
a ship and cannot escape...

723
01:08:17.632 --> 01:08:20.717
and there is a world to enjoy,
traverse, circumnavigate.


724
01:08:21.632 --> 01:08:23.757
Or can she not have friends, Mr. Wedderburn?

725
01:08:24.882 --> 01:08:26.007
Delighted.

726
01:08:29.132 --> 01:08:30.425
Marry me.

727
01:08:30.592 --> 01:08:31.425
What?

728
01:08:31.592 --> 01:08:32.925
I meant to throw you aside.

729
01:08:33.092 --> 01:08:35.632
A few months and send you packing,
but I cannot.


730
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.467
Say you'll marry me.
No one's ever captured my heart. You have.


731
01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:41.132
It is tricky...

732
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.717
as I am engaged to Mr. 
Max McCandles.

733
01:08:45.007 --> 01:08:45.842
What?

734
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:49.050
My hand has taken by another.

735
01:08:49.757 --> 01:08:52.675
It is a saying I heard,
but did not understand.


736
01:08:52.842 --> 01:08:56.007
You do not take just the hand,
but all, do you not?


737
01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:58.757
You ran away with me from him.

738
01:08:58.925 --> 01:09:02.175
A recounting of events,
the point of which is elusive to me.


739
01:09:02.342 --> 01:09:03.632
You chose me over him.

740
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.300
For now.

741
01:09:05.467 --> 01:09:06.507
For fun.

742
01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:09.342
I'll fucking throw you overboard!

743
01:09:09.507 --> 01:09:12.467
So you wish to
marry me or kill me?

744
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.300
- Is that the proposal?
- No.


745
01:09:31.342 --> 01:09:32.757
Going to the casino.

746
01:09:44.132 --> 01:09:45.217
That's fine.

747
01:09:45.967 --> 01:09:47.175
She is coming along.

748
01:09:47.342 --> 01:09:48.925
Let's try again.

749
01:09:49.425 --> 01:09:52.967
Gross motor skills will develop slowly...

750
01:09:53.425 --> 01:09:55.842
but you will progress fast.

751
01:09:57.842 --> 01:09:58.883
Felicity.

752
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:04.050
Not that fast.

753
01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:17.758
I am reading Emerson.

754
01:10:17.925 --> 01:10:20.342
He speaks about the improvement of men.

755
01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:23.592
I do not know why
he does not give advice to women.


756
01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:25.342
Perhaps he does not know any.

757
01:10:26.383 --> 01:10:29.092
Try and read Goethe.

758
01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:31.800
Philosophy is a waste of time, Bella.

759
01:10:31.967 --> 01:10:34.175
Really? Say more.

760
01:10:34.342 --> 01:10:36.258
No, no, Harry, you wretch.

761
01:10:36.425 --> 01:10:37.383
It is integral.

762
01:10:38.425 --> 01:10:41.508
People and society can be improved.

763
01:10:42.508 --> 01:10:46.342
It is the goal of all to improve,
advance, progress, grow.


764
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.883
I know this in me,
and I am sure I am indicative of all.


765
01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:54.092
Trust me, you are definitely unique, Bella,
in all ways.


766
01:10:54.258 --> 01:10:57.800
But this improvement through philosophy...

767
01:10:57.967 --> 01:11:02.050
is people trying to run away from the fact
that we are all cruel beasts.


768
01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:04.508
Born that way, die that way.

769
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:07.342
It is a dark view of things, Harry.

770
01:11:07.508 --> 01:11:08.425
Bella...

771
01:11:09.967 --> 01:11:11.425
let us take the air...

772
01:11:12.967 --> 01:11:14.592
in our cabin.

773
01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:16.300
But these two are fighting...

774
01:11:16.467 --> 01:11:19.258
and ideas are banging around
in Bella's head and heart...


775
01:11:19.425 --> 01:11:21.050
like lights in a storm.

776
01:11:23.717 --> 01:11:26.133
You're always reading now, Bella.

777
01:11:26.675 --> 01:11:30.217
You're losing some of your adorable way
of speaking.


778
01:11:30.383 --> 01:11:32.050
I am a changingable feast...

779
01:11:32.217 --> 01:11:33.467
as are all of we.

780
01:11:33.633 --> 01:11:36.467
Apparently according to Emerson,
disagreed with by Harry.


781
01:11:36.633 --> 01:11:37.925
Come, come. Just come.

782
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:41.217
You are in my sun.

783
01:11:41.383 --> 01:11:42.842
What?

784
01:12:21.592 --> 01:12:22.550
Come.

785
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.092
Busy drinking heavily.

786
01:12:29.925 --> 01:12:31.925
Busy losing heavily.

787
01:13:11.175 --> 01:13:12.758
I must go meet Martha.

788
01:13:14.508 --> 01:13:15.758
Martha.

789
01:13:16.717 --> 01:13:18.258
She is the problem.

790
01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.508
I'll throw that
perfumed bag of flesh overboard.


791
01:13:23.592 --> 01:13:24.717
I dare you.

792
01:13:35.133 --> 01:13:36.592
Martha!

793
01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:39.050
Where is she?

794
01:13:39.217 --> 01:13:40.800
Where are you, fuck.

795
01:13:40.967 --> 01:13:42.342
Where is she?

796
01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.175
- Where are you going?
- She's going over the side.


797
01:13:46.342 --> 01:13:47.467
Oh, marvelous!

798
01:13:47.633 --> 01:13:49.717
I never imagined being murdered.

799
01:13:49.883 --> 01:13:50.883
How dramatic.

800
01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:54.300
Well, she seems happy to die.
I'm sorry for getting in your way.


801
01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:01.508
Exciting.

802
01:14:19.383 --> 01:14:20.842
I'll be in the bar.

803
01:14:54.633 --> 01:14:57.258
You have made me think, cogitate...

804
01:14:58.133 --> 01:15:00.967
perambulate on ideas that are wrong...

805
01:15:01.133 --> 01:15:04.300
erroneous and nonsensically annoying...

806
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.175
that lead me not to sleep.

807
01:15:06.342 --> 01:15:07.467
So...

808
01:15:09.342 --> 01:15:11.467
You say all are cruel.

809
01:15:11.633 --> 01:15:14.217
And I disagree, disavow...

810
01:15:14.383 --> 01:15:15.425
and say no not.

811
01:15:16.675 --> 01:15:18.675
But when with Duncan...

812
01:15:18.842 --> 01:15:21.383
the cruel just bubbles up in me.

813
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.300
That shows good judgment.

814
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.800
He is a pretty moron.

815
01:15:25.967 --> 01:15:26.925
No.

816
01:15:27.592 --> 01:15:29.217
I do not wish to be cruel.

817
01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.050
I must improve this aspect of myself.

818
01:15:33.217 --> 01:15:34.758
You don't know the world.

819
01:15:35.342 --> 01:15:36.425
And you fear it.

820
01:15:38.842 --> 01:15:40.425
I do not fear it.

821
01:15:40.842 --> 01:15:43.008
Do you want to see what the world
is really like?


822
01:15:43.633 --> 01:15:44.467
I'll show you.

823
01:15:45.217 --> 01:15:46.133
Yes.

824
01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:47.842
Of course.

825
01:16:34.717 --> 01:16:35.717
Do you hear that?

826
01:16:39.342 --> 01:16:40.342
What is it?

827
01:17:01.758 --> 01:17:03.258
Lot of dead babies.

828
01:17:04.258 --> 01:17:05.467
Must be hot.

829
01:17:07.217 --> 01:17:08.633
We must go help them.

830
01:17:09.717 --> 01:17:11.050
How will we do that?

831
01:17:13.925 --> 01:17:15.217
We go down there...

832
01:17:15.383 --> 01:17:18.883
they'll quite rightfully rope us,
rob us, and rape us.


833
01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:21.217
And if they were here
and we were there...


834
01:17:21.842 --> 01:17:23.217
we'd do the same to them.

835
01:17:27.758 --> 01:17:28.550
Bella.

836
01:17:29.633 --> 01:17:30.592
Bella.

837
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:32.550
Bella.

838
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.342
We are casting off, ma'am.

839
01:19:16.842 --> 01:19:18.342
But I have to go back.

840
01:19:19.425 --> 01:19:23.217
I must give this money
to the poor near the hotel...


841
01:19:23.383 --> 01:19:24.925
in what they call a slum.

842
01:19:26.175 --> 01:19:27.592
We're staying ashore, ma'am.

843
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:30.008
We could take care of that for you.

844
01:19:30.717 --> 01:19:31.550
You can?

845
01:19:31.758 --> 01:19:32.758
Of course.

846
01:19:33.133 --> 01:19:34.717
It is generous of you.

847
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.383
They need money.

848
01:19:36.883 --> 01:19:38.092
Everyone does.

849
01:19:43.758 --> 01:19:44.800
Thank you.

850
01:20:01.967 --> 01:20:05.383
You! Get me the captain.
Now we'll find this fucking thief.


851
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:06.383
Bella!

852
01:20:08.217 --> 01:20:09.258
We've been robbed!

853
01:20:10.133 --> 01:20:11.383
I won.

854
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:13.008
I won everything...

855
01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:14.633
like never before.

856
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.967
And now it's gone.

857
01:20:17.133 --> 01:20:18.842
You've not been robbed.

858
01:20:19.008 --> 01:20:20.842
- I took it.
- For what?


859
01:20:21.425 --> 01:20:22.467
I took it.

860
01:20:24.383 --> 01:20:25.675
I'm so tired.

861
01:20:27.675 --> 01:20:30.008
Or maybe just my spirit is.

862
01:20:30.883 --> 01:20:33.508
My soul has been buckled, crumpled...

863
01:20:33.717 --> 01:20:36.508
flattened, Duncan Wedderburn...

864
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.883
by the sights I have seen.

865
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:45.508
- So, no need for the captain then, sir?
- Fuck off before I break all your teeth.


866
01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:48.133
Indeed, sir.

867
01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:52.842
Where is it?

868
01:20:53.592 --> 01:20:55.133
You hid it for safety.

869
01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.675
I was drunk and foolishly left it everywhere.
What a relief.


870
01:20:59.342 --> 01:21:01.092
I did not hide it.

871
01:21:01.883 --> 01:21:05.258
I gave it to
those poor people out there.

872
01:21:05.842 --> 01:21:08.967
Money is its own form of sickness...

873
01:21:09.508 --> 01:21:11.175
and all the scarcity of it.

874
01:21:12.592 --> 01:21:14.092
And who am I...

875
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.758
lying in a feather bed...

876
01:21:17.967 --> 01:21:19.508
while dead babies...

877
01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.467
lie in a ditch?

878
01:21:23.425 --> 01:21:24.467
Duncan.

879
01:21:26.217 --> 01:21:28.050
You what?

880
01:21:29.675 --> 01:21:32.717
I am expecting a hug of solace.

881
01:21:33.592 --> 01:21:34.425
You...

882
01:21:34.633 --> 01:21:37.217
I need to offer something
to the world.


883
01:21:38.175 --> 01:21:39.675
And yet I have nothing.

884
01:21:40.967 --> 01:21:42.175
Except some money.

885
01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:46.925
It is a bad day for Bella Baxter.

886
01:21:48.008 --> 01:21:51.300
Where is my fucking money?

887
01:21:51.467 --> 01:21:52.592
I just told you.

888
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.508
I gave it away to the poor.

889
01:21:56.967 --> 01:21:59.217
I thought I told you to fuck off!

890
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:01.800
The steward informs me...

891
01:22:01.967 --> 01:22:04.842
that you may not have sufficient funds
to make good your account, sir.


892
01:22:05.508 --> 01:22:07.258
- Well, I...
- That is probably true.


893
01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:10.092
I gave it all to some nice men...

894
01:22:11.133 --> 01:22:12.467
to pass on...

895
01:22:12.967 --> 01:22:14.425
to the slum poor.

896
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:17.217
You'll be put ashore at the next port...

897
01:22:17.383 --> 01:22:19.508
and confined to crew's rations
until then, sir.


898
01:22:19.675 --> 01:22:21.550
- Good evening.
- How dare you?


899
01:22:32.717 --> 01:22:36.175
"Dead, blind babies...

900
01:22:37.633 --> 01:22:38.967
"bit Harry.

901
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.467
"My mouth...

902
01:22:42.633 --> 01:22:46.050
"was full of blood."

903
01:22:47.383 --> 01:22:48.508
Poor Bella.

904
01:22:50.342 --> 01:22:51.550
She is a ruin.

905
01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.550
- How's your hand?
- It's fine.


906
01:22:59.092 --> 01:23:00.133
I'm sorry.

907
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.008
You were trying to help me understand.

908
01:23:02.175 --> 01:23:04.717
No. I actually wanted to hurt you.

909
01:23:05.925 --> 01:23:09.967
Couldn't bear to see such dumb,
beautiful happiness in someone.


910
01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:11.717
It was cruel of me.

911
01:23:12.383 --> 01:23:13.550
I am not sorry.

912
01:23:14.425 --> 01:23:16.258
If I know the world, 
I can improve it.

913
01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:17.550
You can't.

914
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:19.467
That is the real point.

915
01:23:20.092 --> 01:23:21.800
Don't accept the lie of religion...

916
01:23:21.967 --> 01:23:22.800
socialism...

917
01:23:23.342 --> 01:23:24.425
capitalism.

918
01:23:24.883 --> 01:23:26.467
We are a fucked species.

919
01:23:26.717 --> 01:23:28.925
Know it. Hope is smashable.

920
01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:30.300
Realism is not.

921
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.508
Protect yourself with the truth.

922
01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.425
I realize what you are now, Harry.

923
01:23:36.592 --> 01:23:39.675
Just a broken little boy
who cannot bear the pain of the world.


924
01:23:41.592 --> 01:23:42.717
I suppose so.

925
01:23:51.925 --> 01:23:53.092
Goodbye, Harry.

926
01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.967
We get thrown off in Marseille.

927
01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.300
Why do you stay with him?

928
01:23:57.883 --> 01:23:59.383
I always think it will be better.

929
01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.425
'Course you do.

930
01:24:18.883 --> 01:24:21.550
I have heard great things
of the beauty of Paris.


931
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:27.467
I'll fucking kick your dog to death.

932
01:24:30.883 --> 01:24:31.883
Fucking...

933
01:24:32.425 --> 01:24:34.050
Paris with no money.

934
01:24:34.508 --> 01:24:37.425
- What do you suggest we do, Bella?
- I will get us a hotel.


935
01:24:37.592 --> 01:24:38.633
Do not worry.

936
01:24:39.258 --> 01:24:40.842
With what? We have no money.

937
01:24:42.717 --> 01:24:45.300
Is it not an interesting experiment?

938
01:24:45.467 --> 01:24:46.383
We have nothing.

939
01:24:47.008 --> 01:24:48.883
- How will we live now?
- I don't know!


940
01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.967
Exactly, that is the experiment.

941
01:24:51.383 --> 01:24:52.592
We are now the poor.

942
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.175
Also, many adventurers have faced these odds.

943
01:24:56.758 --> 01:24:58.133
Robinson Crusoe, for example.

944
01:24:58.675 --> 01:25:01.258
Selfish, thoughtless, careless bitch.

945
01:25:01.508 --> 01:25:03.675
I'm not thoughtless, Duncan.

946
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:05.717
And while it is true my ability...

947
01:25:05.883 --> 01:25:08.967
to think things through
to the logical conclusions is not...


948
01:25:09.592 --> 01:25:10.758
strong...

949
01:25:11.175 --> 01:25:13.217
I did help those suffering people.

950
01:25:13.633 --> 01:25:14.633
I have ruined us...

951
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:16.300
as you pointed out...

952
01:25:16.842 --> 01:25:19.133
but I do believe my actions
come from a good place.


953
01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.383
Shut the fuck up.

954
01:25:22.258 --> 01:25:23.633
I will get us a hotel.

955
01:25:28.967 --> 01:25:30.383
Good afternoon, madam.

956
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:33.717
Good day, my fresh, darling English Rose.

957
01:25:34.675 --> 01:25:35.717
Is this a hotel?

958
01:25:35.925 --> 01:25:37.008
We have rooms.

959
01:25:37.508 --> 01:25:38.717
Are you looking for work?

960
01:25:38.883 --> 01:25:39.925
How much is a room?

961
01:25:40.092 --> 01:25:42.175
I'll charge you 10 francs an hour.

962
01:25:42.342 --> 01:25:44.383
You charge them 30.

963
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:45.675
Everyone's happy.

964
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.300
I see.

965
01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.217
<i>Monsieur</i> Chapelle.

966
01:25:49.383 --> 01:25:50.383
Fresh from London.

967
01:25:52.383 --> 01:25:53.383
Hello.

968
01:25:59.133 --> 01:26:00.342
So, off you go.

969
01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.342
At this point, 
I am confused.

970
01:26:02.508 --> 01:26:04.133
You're not here to work?

971
01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:05.508
Come on.

972
01:26:05.675 --> 01:26:08.133
Lie with him, let
him cock you a bit...

973
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.675
and make some nice francs.

974
01:26:09.842 --> 01:26:10.675
I see.

975
01:26:11.675 --> 01:26:12.967
He would pay me for this?

976
01:26:13.467 --> 01:26:14.467
Yes.

977
01:26:15.008 --> 01:26:16.467
If you need money...

978
01:26:16.633 --> 01:26:18.717
it is the shortest route to it.

979
01:26:19.717 --> 01:26:22.592
I have never been cocked by another man...

980
01:26:23.258 --> 01:26:24.717
and yet have wondered on that.

981
01:26:25.633 --> 01:26:27.050
And am in need of funds.

982
01:26:28.467 --> 01:26:31.925
It is, I believe,
a confluence of circumstances...


983
01:26:32.092 --> 01:26:34.092
I regard as almost fate-like.

984
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:35.883
Let us do this.

985
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:39.800
Room 16.

986
01:27:17.508 --> 01:27:18.633
What is your name?

987
01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:27.842
Mysterious.

988
01:27:55.592 --> 01:27:57.217
Should we warm me up a bit...

989
01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:31.133
Good day, sir.

990
01:28:31.592 --> 01:28:33.050
<i>Éclair au chocolat?</i>

991
01:28:34.425 --> 01:28:36.967
I've come into some money
and some enlightenment.


992
01:28:37.842 --> 01:28:38.883
You stole it?

993
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.092
You've always said you're
the best bedman in the world...


994
01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:46.092
and I have never known another,
so I knew not whether this was true.


995
01:28:46.633 --> 01:28:47.842
But now I do.

996
01:28:48.467 --> 01:28:49.717
And he was terrible...

997
01:28:50.175 --> 01:28:53.300
and made ungodly noises
as he thrust himself into me.


998
01:28:53.467 --> 01:28:57.008
And a mere three thrusts, Duncan Wedderburn,
was all he could manage.


999
01:28:57.217 --> 01:28:58.633
I stifled a laugh...

1000
01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.633
out of polites, of course.

1001
01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.842
I took his money. 
I thanked him.

1002
01:29:03.008 --> 01:29:05.425
I laughed all the way
to buy us these eclairs...


1003
01:29:05.592 --> 01:29:06.717
and I thought so fondly...

1004
01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:10.217
remembering the fierce sweaty nights of ours.

1005
01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.425
You fucked for money?

1006
01:29:13.592 --> 01:29:15.133
And as an experiment.

1007
01:29:15.967 --> 01:29:20.050
And it is good for our relationship
as it gladdens my heart toward you.


1008
01:29:20.217 --> 01:29:23.925
My heart has been a bit dim
on your weepy, sweary person lately.


1009
01:29:25.758 --> 01:29:28.300
You are a monster. 
A whore and a monster.

1010
01:29:28.467 --> 01:29:29.925
A demon sent from hell...

1011
01:29:30.133 --> 01:29:31.675
to rip my spirit to shreds.

1012
01:29:31.842 --> 01:29:34.592
To punish my tiny sins...

1013
01:29:34.758 --> 01:29:36.425
with a tsunami of destruction.

1014
01:29:36.592 --> 01:29:38.383
To take my heart
and pull it like taffy...

1015
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:39.383
to ruin me.

1016
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:41.467
I look at you,
and I see nothing but ugliness.


1017
01:29:42.967 --> 01:29:45.925
That last bit was uncalled for
and makes no sense...


1018
01:29:46.092 --> 01:29:48.717
as your odes to
my beauty have been boring...

1019
01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:49.925
but constant.

1020
01:29:50.508 --> 01:29:52.758
And the simple act...

1021
01:29:52.925 --> 01:29:55.383
of letting a strange man ride on me...

1022
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:56.592
has erased all that?

1023
01:29:58.925 --> 01:29:59.925
Fuck!

1024
01:30:00.092 --> 01:30:02.175
You whored yourself.

1025
01:30:02.675 --> 01:30:04.925
Which you are now going to
explain to me is bad.


1026
01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.508
Can I never win with you?

1027
01:30:06.675 --> 01:30:09.383
It is the worst thing women can do.

1028
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:12.592
We should definitely never marry.

1029
01:30:13.467 --> 01:30:15.717
I am a flawed, experimenting person...

1030
01:30:15.883 --> 01:30:18.675
and I will need a husband
with a more forgiving disposition.


1031
01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.633
Cunt!

1032
01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.383
I can now see you are not that.

1033
01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.633
Our adventure is clearly over.

1034
01:30:25.258 --> 01:30:27.258
I shall book you
a passage back to London.

1035
01:30:27.717 --> 01:30:29.133
You had money...

1036
01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:30.883
this whole time?

1037
01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:32.300
It is God's money.

1038
01:30:33.342 --> 01:30:34.383
For emergencies.

1039
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:36.883
It has been a fucking emergency
for weeks now!


1040
01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:38.842
I believed in you the whole time...

1041
01:30:39.342 --> 01:30:40.967
that you would rise to the occasion.

1042
01:30:41.425 --> 01:30:44.717
But now I see that was a mistake,
and there's clearly something broken in you.


1043
01:30:44.883 --> 01:30:47.092
You broke that something in me!

1044
01:30:47.258 --> 01:30:49.467
I feel this conversation has become circular.

1045
01:30:49.633 --> 01:30:52.050
Cunt!

1046
01:30:58.258 --> 01:31:00.592
Madam Swiney, I have examined my situation.

1047
01:31:00.758 --> 01:31:02.342
I need sex and money.

1048
01:31:02.842 --> 01:31:04.050
I could take a lover...

1049
01:31:04.217 --> 01:31:05.967
another Wedderburn who would keep me...

1050
01:31:06.133 --> 01:31:08.217
but may require an awful lot of attention.

1051
01:31:08.383 --> 01:31:10.092
Or else it's 20 minutes at a time...

1052
01:31:10.258 --> 01:31:12.383
and the rest of my day
is free to study on the world...


1053
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:13.717
and the improvement of it.

1054
01:31:14.258 --> 01:31:16.592
Hence, I seek employment...

1055
01:31:16.758 --> 01:31:19.675
at your musty-smelling establishment
of good-time fornication.


1056
01:31:19.842 --> 01:31:22.800
A woman plotting her course to freedom.

1057
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:25.008
How delightful.

1058
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.800
Come.

1059
01:31:30.342 --> 01:31:32.550
<i>Monsieur</i> Saveur.

1060
01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.342
A filet mignon.

1061
01:31:35.925 --> 01:31:37.883
A prime cut.

1062
01:31:50.883 --> 01:31:52.175
Bella.

1063
01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:55.550
Say <i>"formidable"</i> at the end.

1064
01:31:55.717 --> 01:31:56.675
House rules.

1065
01:32:25.633 --> 01:32:27.175
Is that smell you?

1066
01:33:01.967 --> 01:33:03.092
<i>Formidable.</i>

1067
01:33:16.008 --> 01:33:17.175
For the smell.

1068
01:33:18.133 --> 01:33:20.133
And tea. Just because tea is nice.

1069
01:33:24.217 --> 01:33:25.425
It was brutal...

1070
01:33:25.925 --> 01:33:27.425
in a strangely not unpleasant way.

1071
01:33:31.508 --> 01:33:32.550
Pamphlet.

1072
01:33:33.842 --> 01:33:35.008
- Read.
- What is that?


1073
01:33:35.175 --> 01:33:37.842
<i>Une personne qui veut...</i>
change the world <i>pour le meilleur.</i>


1074
01:33:38.008 --> 01:33:39.883
Make it better. 
A better world.

1075
01:33:40.925 --> 01:33:42.675
Then I am that too.

1076
01:33:53.758 --> 01:33:54.633
Madam Swiney...

1077
01:33:55.008 --> 01:33:56.717
this lineup system...

1078
01:33:56.883 --> 01:34:00.508
you really expect me to go upstairs
with a man even if I find him distasteful...


1079
01:34:00.675 --> 01:34:02.717
and therefore am sad...

1080
01:34:02.883 --> 01:34:04.342
when I let him furious jump me?

1081
01:34:04.508 --> 01:34:06.925
That is the way it is, my darling.

1082
01:34:10.008 --> 01:34:11.467
Gosh, you look pretty.

1083
01:34:11.633 --> 01:34:13.800
How it agrees with you to be ravaged.

1084
01:34:14.675 --> 01:34:15.717
I suppose so.

1085
01:34:20.592 --> 01:34:22.967
So, would you not prefer it
if the women chose...


1086
01:34:23.383 --> 01:34:25.925
as it would be a sign of enthusiasm
toward you?


1087
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.383
You wouldn't have the vague sense
that they are in a state of horror...


1088
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:30.592
when you jump them.

1089
01:34:34.842 --> 01:34:37.425
Bella is new and
may have a mental illness.

1090
01:34:41.508 --> 01:34:43.050
As God, my father, says...

1091
01:34:43.383 --> 01:34:46.092
it is only the way it is until we discover
the new way it is...


1092
01:34:46.258 --> 01:34:48.967
and then that is the way it is
until we discover the new way it is...


1093
01:34:49.133 --> 01:34:51.217
and so it goes until the world
is no longer flat...


1094
01:34:51.383 --> 01:34:54.467
electricity lights the night,
and shoes are no longer tied with ribbons.


1095
01:34:55.675 --> 01:34:57.383
As a socialist, 
I agree entirely.

1096
01:34:58.508 --> 01:35:01.008
Toinette, you have such a clever mouth.

1097
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:04.425
<i>Monsieur</i> Mersault will enjoy it for free.

1098
01:35:04.967 --> 01:35:06.550
Go. Now.

1099
01:35:07.258 --> 01:35:09.717
Bella, a moment in my office.

1100
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.508
You have the most delicious looking lobes.

1101
01:35:15.592 --> 01:35:16.508
Thank you.

1102
01:35:16.675 --> 01:35:17.675
I must...

1103
01:35:21.467 --> 01:35:23.425
Oh, I am sorry. I drew blood.

1104
01:35:24.258 --> 01:35:25.342
Here.

1105
01:35:27.883 --> 01:35:32.175
I sometimes give in to myself
when I see beauty, young beauty.


1106
01:35:32.342 --> 01:35:33.842
For one day, my dear...

1107
01:35:34.008 --> 01:35:37.008
you will be a wrinkled, old husk.

1108
01:35:37.175 --> 01:35:41.592
And no one will want you either
to pay you for it or to have it for free.


1109
01:35:42.258 --> 01:35:44.925
I still believe everyone would be happier
if we could choose.


1110
01:35:45.092 --> 01:35:46.550
An idealist.

1111
01:35:46.717 --> 01:35:47.883
Like me.

1112
01:35:48.508 --> 01:35:50.800
How delightful you are.

1113
01:35:50.967 --> 01:35:55.217
But we must give in to the demands
of the world sometimes.


1114
01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:57.092
Grapple with it, try to defeat it.

1115
01:35:57.258 --> 01:35:59.550
- So you believe as me?
- Of course.


1116
01:35:59.717 --> 01:36:03.842
But some men enjoy that
you do not like it.

1117
01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:04.883
What?

1118
01:36:06.592 --> 01:36:07.675
- That is...
- Sick.


1119
01:36:07.842 --> 01:36:09.633
But good business.

1120
01:36:10.258 --> 01:36:11.508
Come with me.

1121
01:36:16.508 --> 01:36:17.925
My grandchild.

1122
01:36:18.717 --> 01:36:22.008
Sick and poorly,
and requiring much doctoring.


1123
01:36:22.175 --> 01:36:26.842
My choice of giving you choice
will jeopardize the business.


1124
01:36:27.008 --> 01:36:28.633
Her health. Her life.

1125
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.175
- Do you want that, Bella?
- Of course not.


1126
01:36:31.342 --> 01:36:33.133
You don't? You're so lovely.

1127
01:36:35.258 --> 01:36:36.967
I thought you were going for my lobes.

1128
01:36:38.842 --> 01:36:40.175
We must work.

1129
01:36:41.008 --> 01:36:43.300
We must make money.

1130
01:36:43.467 --> 01:36:46.800
But more than that,
we must experience everything...


1131
01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:48.175
not just the good.

1132
01:36:48.342 --> 01:36:51.508
But degradation, horror, sadness...

1133
01:36:51.675 --> 01:36:54.133
This makes us whole, Bella.

1134
01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.425
Makes us people of substance...

1135
01:36:56.592 --> 01:36:58.883
not flighty, untouched children.

1136
01:37:00.258 --> 01:37:02.008
Then we can know the world.

1137
01:37:03.092 --> 01:37:05.133
And when we know the world...

1138
01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.383
the world is ours.

1139
01:37:08.425 --> 01:37:09.550
I want that.

1140
01:37:10.217 --> 01:37:11.675
Now...

1141
01:37:11.842 --> 01:37:13.633
go and fuck someone...

1142
01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:16.633
and bring me 10 francs.

1143
01:37:20.425 --> 01:37:22.800
First, I suggest a short quiz.

1144
01:37:23.633 --> 01:37:24.508
A quiz?

1145
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.092
You tell me a childhood memory.

1146
01:37:29.925 --> 01:37:31.508
Then I tell a joke.

1147
01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.425
Then a quick sniff...

1148
01:37:34.592 --> 01:37:37.758
and if necessary,
a quick douse in lavender oil.


1149
01:37:37.925 --> 01:37:42.508
And all of this will enhance the experience
making it <i>formidable.</i>


1150
01:37:45.717 --> 01:37:47.550
<i>Non,</i> I tell the joke.

1151
01:37:47.717 --> 01:37:48.883
You the memory.

1152
01:37:59.092 --> 01:38:03.175
When you were little in Greece,
you fell from your bicycle?


1153
01:38:09.842 --> 01:38:11.592
Blood. Down my leg.

1154
01:38:15.675 --> 01:38:16.675
Joy?

1155
01:38:16.842 --> 01:38:18.425
You watched the blood with joy.

1156
01:38:19.883 --> 01:38:20.967
Knock, knock.

1157
01:38:24.383 --> 01:38:25.633
Cheese to meet you.

1158
01:38:36.342 --> 01:38:37.425
You know it.

1159
01:38:41.758 --> 01:38:43.050
You smell okay.

1160
01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:44.133
Let us fuck.

1161
01:39:29.675 --> 01:39:32.092
God gave you a gift, my friend.

1162
01:40:12.842 --> 01:40:14.925
Very inelegant work.

1163
01:40:15.092 --> 01:40:16.925
This is what you do when you're homesick?

1164
01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:32.967
You wish what?

1165
01:40:33.133 --> 01:40:36.008
My boys are of an age for education.
Sexual.


1166
01:40:37.633 --> 01:40:38.717
I will demonstrate.

1167
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:40.508
I see.

1168
01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:49.258
At times.

1169
01:41:03.883 --> 01:41:06.050
Shall I lay, bend, astride?

1170
01:41:06.383 --> 01:41:07.842
Let's start simple, please.

1171
01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.175
To aid things along...

1172
01:41:44.342 --> 01:41:46.092
- a finger in the arse.
- No.


1173
01:41:46.258 --> 01:41:48.300
Or a slight choking may do it.

1174
01:42:16.133 --> 01:42:17.467
Go home!

1175
01:42:25.008 --> 01:42:26.258
Bella!

1176
01:42:27.675 --> 01:42:29.508
Madam Swiney was right.

1177
01:42:29.675 --> 01:42:32.425
I am discovering parts of myself
hitherto unknown.


1178
01:42:32.592 --> 01:42:34.133
It is a way to look at it.

1179
01:42:34.883 --> 01:42:38.133
The variety of desires being made manifest
is fascinating.


1180
01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:39.133
Have you had the man...

1181
01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:41.925
who puts a wedge of pineapple in your mouth
and covers you in dust?


1182
01:42:43.592 --> 01:42:44.425
Bella.

1183
01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.425
I'm almost ready to forgive you.

1184
01:42:47.592 --> 01:42:48.842
I've booked our berths home...

1185
01:42:49.008 --> 01:42:51.550
and I've told Mother
to prepare our wedding bed.


1186
01:42:52.675 --> 01:42:54.425
Did you fuck that
guy with hooks for hands?

1187
01:42:54.592 --> 01:42:56.092
You did. I know!

1188
01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.258
I beat the tar out of that guy.

1189
01:42:59.425 --> 01:43:01.300
Duncan. I thought you left.

1190
01:43:01.467 --> 01:43:03.842
Back to the ship,
but started to ache and vomit...


1191
01:43:04.133 --> 01:43:05.300
so I'm here to save you.

1192
01:43:05.467 --> 01:43:06.675
Hello, Duncan.

1193
01:43:09.967 --> 01:43:11.175
Go home, Duncan.

1194
01:43:11.342 --> 01:43:12.800
Our time has ended.

1195
01:43:12.967 --> 01:43:13.883
I look at you and feel nothing...

1196
01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:16.217
but the lingering question
of how did I ever want you?


1197
01:43:17.258 --> 01:43:19.050
And we must go
to the meeting of socialists.

1198
01:43:21.842 --> 01:43:23.175
You're whores.

1199
01:43:23.342 --> 01:43:25.633
We are our own means of production.

1200
01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.883
Go away.

1201
01:43:39.508 --> 01:43:40.425
Foot.

1202
01:43:42.508 --> 01:43:43.675
Paint, foot.

1203
01:43:43.842 --> 01:43:44.842
Very good.

1204
01:43:48.342 --> 01:43:50.717
Language is slow but improving.

1205
01:43:50.883 --> 01:43:51.883
Paint. Foot.

1206
01:43:52.050 --> 01:43:52.967
Genius.

1207
01:43:53.925 --> 01:43:55.800
Can you not be so cruel to her?

1208
01:43:55.967 --> 01:43:57.508
I made a mistake with Bella.

1209
01:43:57.675 --> 01:43:59.550
I allowed feelings to develop.

1210
01:44:00.342 --> 01:44:03.967
There are none for her.
She is no different to the chicken dog.


1211
01:44:04.133 --> 01:44:05.050
Foot.

1212
01:44:05.217 --> 01:44:07.133
It is better this way, perhaps...

1213
01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:10.300
and gives some insight
into my father's coolness to me.


1214
01:44:10.467 --> 01:44:13.092
It was a necessity of science.

1215
01:44:13.258 --> 01:44:14.383
Good God, man.

1216
01:44:14.592 --> 01:44:17.133
- Foot.
- I do not expect you to understand...


1217
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.550
village doctor.

1218
01:44:19.758 --> 01:44:22.258
By the way, I need
you to operate on me.

1219
01:44:22.717 --> 01:44:24.967
Shall I put a beating heart
in your monstrous form?


1220
01:44:25.883 --> 01:44:27.133
If you have time...

1221
01:44:27.967 --> 01:44:29.217
while taking...

1222
01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.383
this out.

1223
01:44:49.717 --> 01:44:52.425
I'll remove some cysts from around the tumor.

1224
01:44:52.592 --> 01:44:55.133
No need. You may close me up.

1225
01:44:55.967 --> 01:44:58.550
It has spread. 
I see tiny polyps.

1226
01:45:01.717 --> 01:45:03.008
I am dying.

1227
01:45:03.175 --> 01:45:05.508
How to break it to the patient, eh?

1228
01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:07.342
Baxter...

1229
01:45:07.508 --> 01:45:10.550
Do not cry into the wound!
You'll kill me faster with sepsis.


1230
01:45:11.258 --> 01:45:12.092
Quiet now.

1231
01:45:12.258 --> 01:45:13.675
And close me up.

1232
01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.675
Find her.

1233
01:45:22.092 --> 01:45:23.675
I am closed.

1234
01:45:30.842 --> 01:45:32.717
Hot chocolate, my dear.

1235
01:45:32.883 --> 01:45:34.967
And <i>pain au chocolat.</i>

1236
01:45:43.342 --> 01:45:44.425
You are my favorite.

1237
01:45:46.758 --> 01:45:49.383
I have heard you
say that to the others.

1238
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:52.967
We are a machine you feed
with compliments and chocolate.


1239
01:45:53.133 --> 01:45:55.300
You are my children I feed with love.

1240
01:46:01.925 --> 01:46:04.883
Something terrible has happened, Swiney.

1241
01:46:05.508 --> 01:46:07.467
I feel almost nothing.

1242
01:46:08.967 --> 01:46:12.175
My empathy is creeping
toward what I would describe...


1243
01:46:12.342 --> 01:46:14.467
as contemptuous rage.

1244
01:46:14.633 --> 01:46:16.383
This is fabulous.

1245
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:17.383
It is?

1246
01:46:20.467 --> 01:46:22.508
You're in the dark period.

1247
01:46:23.383 --> 01:46:26.300
Before light and wisdom come to you.

1248
01:46:27.675 --> 01:46:29.508
You must forge through it...

1249
01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:31.883
and once on the other side...

1250
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:36.508
you will be grateful to this moment,
but you must keep going.


1251
01:46:36.717 --> 01:46:37.758
I see.

1252
01:47:53.675 --> 01:47:55.092
You've got a baby scar.

1253
01:47:58.092 --> 01:47:59.383
Mine is with <i>ma maman.</i>

1254
01:48:01.675 --> 01:48:02.842
I don't have one.

1255
01:48:04.175 --> 01:48:06.342
It is an accident scar.

1256
01:48:06.508 --> 01:48:08.925
But you're not the first
to have made the mistake.


1257
01:48:09.092 --> 01:48:10.175
Why lie?

1258
01:48:11.133 --> 01:48:12.300
I'm not lying.

1259
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:14.800
My Godwin told me himself.

1260
01:48:32.717 --> 01:48:33.842
Wedderburn.

1261
01:48:58.842 --> 01:48:59.967
Good day, sir.

1262
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:06.383
You wrote to Mr. 
Godwin Baxter.

1263
01:49:06.717 --> 01:49:09.008
He has sent a demon
at large into the world.

1264
01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:12.592
The devil's wrapped in an alluring body
that cannot be satiated...


1265
01:49:12.758 --> 01:49:15.758
and a mind that picks people apart
stitch by stitch...


1266
01:49:15.925 --> 01:49:19.467
like a bloodied and burned rag doll
shat out of an elephant's arse.


1267
01:49:19.633 --> 01:49:20.383
Bella.

1268
01:49:21.133 --> 01:49:22.217
Where is she?

1269
01:49:22.383 --> 01:49:23.342
Who are you?

1270
01:49:23.508 --> 01:49:25.175
I'm her fiancé, sir.

1271
01:49:29.342 --> 01:49:32.050
Obviously, things did not end well
between you.


1272
01:49:32.217 --> 01:49:33.258
Did not?

1273
01:49:34.050 --> 01:49:35.383
She destroyed me.

1274
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:38.467
Well, we're all masters
of our own ship, sir.

1275
01:49:38.633 --> 01:49:39.383
There's that.

1276
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:42.758
I do not like you or your words.

1277
01:49:42.925 --> 01:49:44.175
That Godwin Baxter.

1278
01:49:44.342 --> 01:49:46.383
He knew, and he
set her on to me.

1279
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:47.425
He trapped me.

1280
01:49:49.425 --> 01:49:50.175
Where is she?

1281
01:49:50.342 --> 01:49:53.258
Would not wish her on my worst enemy.

1282
01:49:55.050 --> 01:49:57.717
I shall save you from her, sir.

1283
01:50:11.342 --> 01:50:13.675
Forgive my frustration. Just tell me.

1284
01:50:13.842 --> 01:50:15.550
It does not hurt.

1285
01:50:15.717 --> 01:50:17.967
I have no insides.

1286
01:50:18.133 --> 01:50:19.925
She hollowed me out.

1287
01:50:20.092 --> 01:50:22.300
My soul. My bank account!

1288
01:50:22.883 --> 01:50:24.175
I am a bug! A shell!

1289
01:50:24.342 --> 01:50:25.342
Shall we sing?

1290
01:50:25.508 --> 01:50:27.675
<i>Oh, we are sailors...</i>

1291
01:50:27.842 --> 01:50:28.758
It doesn't...

1292
01:50:30.883 --> 01:50:32.300
Doesn't hurt.

1293
01:50:34.425 --> 01:50:36.258
I do not wish
it to be like this.

1294
01:50:37.633 --> 01:50:38.675
You force my hand.

1295
01:50:38.883 --> 01:50:41.383
"We're all masters of our own ship."

1296
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:44.342
You cunting cunt-faced deadshit.

1297
01:50:44.758 --> 01:50:45.800
Please.

1298
01:50:45.967 --> 01:50:47.633
I ask you as politely as I can.

1299
01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.633
Where is she?

1300
01:51:45.925 --> 01:51:47.675
The whore is back.

1301
01:51:52.842 --> 01:51:53.675
God?

1302
01:51:53.842 --> 01:51:55.133
Bella!

1303
01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:56.758
Max wrote me.

1304
01:51:56.925 --> 01:51:59.217
- You are ill?
- I am not. I am dying.


1305
01:51:59.383 --> 01:52:03.175
A subtle difference,
but one I take seriously as a physician.


1306
01:52:03.342 --> 01:52:05.050
You are a sight and a good one.

1307
01:52:05.217 --> 01:52:06.050
You cannot die.

1308
01:52:06.217 --> 01:52:08.425
Empirical data says different.

1309
01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:10.675
I missed you.

1310
01:52:11.967 --> 01:52:14.883
I now have to lie down.

1311
01:52:21.092 --> 01:52:22.883
It is not all sunshine I bring.

1312
01:52:24.467 --> 01:52:27.175
I also bring beady eyes and hard questions.

1313
01:52:28.883 --> 01:52:30.383
Did I have a baby in me?

1314
01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:32.550
And if so, where is it?

1315
01:52:32.717 --> 01:52:33.800
I see.

1316
01:52:34.925 --> 01:52:38.633
Well, technically, you are your baby.

1317
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:41.508
And also, I suppose you are your mother.

1318
01:52:41.675 --> 01:52:43.508
And also neither.

1319
01:52:43.675 --> 01:52:45.467
No memory survives.

1320
01:52:45.633 --> 01:52:47.300
No experiences survive.

1321
01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:50.383
What do you mean
I am mother and daughter?

1322
01:53:08.508 --> 01:53:10.092
You knew and did not tell.

1323
01:53:10.258 --> 01:53:13.300
I did not see good reason to.

1324
01:53:13.467 --> 01:53:14.592
And were too cowardly to.

1325
01:53:14.758 --> 01:53:16.383
A bit of that as well.

1326
01:53:17.883 --> 01:53:19.425
I wanted to be with you...

1327
01:53:19.883 --> 01:53:22.217
and I was not
sure you would even understand.

1328
01:53:22.383 --> 01:53:25.800
And Baxter kind of makes one a prisoner
to him.


1329
01:53:25.967 --> 01:53:27.175
And I am...

1330
01:53:30.467 --> 01:53:31.300
I'm sorry.

1331
01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:43.217
Bam.

1332
01:53:44.425 --> 01:53:45.467
Bam.

1333
01:53:46.633 --> 01:53:47.550
Bam.

1334
01:53:48.758 --> 01:53:49.758
Bam.

1335
01:53:50.925 --> 01:53:52.008
Bam.

1336
01:53:52.967 --> 01:53:53.925
Bam.

1337
01:53:55.217 --> 01:53:56.217
Bam.

1338
01:53:56.383 --> 01:53:57.383
Who is this?

1339
01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:59.550
<i>Bell whore</i>

1340
01:53:59.758 --> 01:54:01.842
<i>- Bell whore
- I</i> see you've introduced me then, Prim.


1341
01:54:02.008 --> 01:54:03.883
- I like this one though.
<i>- Bell whore</i>


1342
01:54:04.050 --> 01:54:05.967
- That's enough now, Felicity...
<i>- Bell whore</i>


1343
01:54:06.717 --> 01:54:07.592
Fucker.

1344
01:54:09.133 --> 01:54:09.967
Another one?

1345
01:54:10.842 --> 01:54:11.883
We missed you.

1346
01:54:12.258 --> 01:54:13.592
Monsters.

1347
01:54:15.383 --> 01:54:16.883
Oh, fucking hell.

1348
01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:19.008
<i>Bell whore</i>

1349
01:54:19.175 --> 01:54:20.800
<i>Bell whore</i>

1350
01:54:58.508 --> 01:55:01.425
<i>It is hard to be in the position
where one wants to hit someone...</i>


1351
01:55:01.592 --> 01:55:03.467
<i>who is already in obvious pain.</i>

1352
01:55:03.633 --> 01:55:06.425
<i>It is a conundrum for sure.</i>

1353
01:55:08.175 --> 01:55:12.133
Would you rather be a gray slab of flesh
with a fishhook in your nose?


1354
01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:15.217
I will feel good for a second,
but bad for longer, so...


1355
01:55:16.675 --> 01:55:18.258
I really had a fishhook in my nose?

1356
01:55:18.425 --> 01:55:19.467
You did.

1357
01:55:21.675 --> 01:55:23.550
So, I am your creation...

1358
01:55:25.383 --> 01:55:26.425
as is the other one.

1359
01:55:26.592 --> 01:55:28.092
Neither of you are that.

1360
01:55:28.258 --> 01:55:31.133
She wanders the halls
with a hammer and a song...


1361
01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.883
and that is not my doing.

1362
01:55:33.508 --> 01:55:35.675
And I read your cards and letters home...

1363
01:55:35.842 --> 01:55:39.258
and watched you fearlessly
create Bella Baxter with wonder.


1364
01:55:39.425 --> 01:55:43.133
I am finding being alive fascinating,
so I'll forgive you the act...


1365
01:55:43.967 --> 01:55:46.217
but always hate the lies and trapping
that followed.


1366
01:55:47.175 --> 01:55:48.342
Understood.

1367
01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:54.925
Good to see you.

1368
01:55:55.092 --> 01:55:56.383
You too.

1369
01:55:57.842 --> 01:56:01.008
Anger, confusion, and brain dissonance aside,
I missed you.


1370
01:56:02.342 --> 01:56:04.383
I arrived home,
and I smelled the formaldehyde...


1371
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:06.008
and I knew what is next.

1372
01:56:08.717 --> 01:56:10.008
I will be a doctor.

1373
01:56:11.383 --> 01:56:13.467
My surgery is yours.

1374
01:56:15.342 --> 01:56:16.633
My father once told me...

1375
01:56:17.883 --> 01:56:20.842
always carve with compassion.

1376
01:56:21.008 --> 01:56:23.008
He was a fucking idiot.

1377
01:56:23.175 --> 01:56:25.633
But it's not bad advice.

1378
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.425
He does not have long.

1379
01:56:31.467 --> 01:56:32.592
I know.

1380
01:56:33.967 --> 01:56:35.883
You've not mentioned our betrothal.

1381
01:56:37.717 --> 01:56:39.633
You were much younger.

1382
01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:42.092
There is no bind.

1383
01:56:42.258 --> 01:56:45.258
I was mesmerized by you,
and Baxter took advantage.


1384
01:56:45.425 --> 01:56:47.175
So, you are mesmerized no more?

1385
01:56:47.592 --> 01:56:50.425
I am still mesmerized.

1386
01:56:51.008 --> 01:56:52.467
I've been a whore, you understand?

1387
01:56:53.425 --> 01:56:55.717
Cocks for money inside me.

1388
01:56:55.883 --> 01:56:57.008
You okay with that?

1389
01:56:57.842 --> 01:57:00.175
Does the whoring thing
challenge the desire...


1390
01:57:00.342 --> 01:57:02.175
for ownership that men have?

1391
01:57:02.342 --> 01:57:04.717
Wedderburn became much weepy and sweary...

1392
01:57:04.883 --> 01:57:06.425
when he discovered my whoring.

1393
01:57:07.050 --> 01:57:10.800
I find myself merely jealous
of the men's time with you...


1394
01:57:10.967 --> 01:57:14.008
rather than any moral aspersion against you.

1395
01:57:14.175 --> 01:57:15.717
It is your body, Bella Baxter.

1396
01:57:15.883 --> 01:57:17.592
Yours to give freely.

1397
01:57:18.633 --> 01:57:20.133
I generally charged 30 francs.

1398
01:57:20.592 --> 01:57:22.883
Well, that seems low.

1399
01:57:24.092 --> 01:57:26.800
Do you believe people improvable, Max?

1400
01:57:26.967 --> 01:57:27.800
I do.

1401
01:57:27.967 --> 01:57:30.925
Just as a human body
can be cured of illness...


1402
01:57:31.092 --> 01:57:34.425
so can men and
women be cured of aspect.

1403
01:57:36.633 --> 01:57:38.550
Will you marry me, 
Max McCandles?

1404
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.675
I will.

1405
01:57:49.050 --> 01:57:50.592
We will need less of your tongue
in the future...


1406
01:57:50.758 --> 01:57:52.467
but overall, most agreeable.

1407
01:57:52.633 --> 01:57:54.467
I will take that note.

1408
01:57:56.342 --> 01:57:59.592
And have you been checked for disease?

1409
01:57:59.758 --> 01:58:01.508
I have not, but I shall.

1410
01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:04.342
I'm enjoying this practical love we have.

1411
01:58:06.258 --> 01:58:09.425
But I assure you mine is also passionate.

1412
01:58:10.258 --> 01:58:11.592
You are adorable.

1413
01:58:12.383 --> 01:58:13.550
You always were.

1414
01:58:23.467 --> 01:58:24.800
God, you are walking.

1415
01:58:24.967 --> 01:58:28.467
I have taken five milligrams of heroin
through the toes for pain...


1416
01:58:28.633 --> 01:58:29.925
amphetamines for energy...

1417
01:58:30.092 --> 01:58:33.717
and cocaine because I am partial to cocaine.

1418
01:58:33.883 --> 01:58:36.883
I've come here to
walk you down the aisle.

1419
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:52.383
And so, by the powers vested in me
by the church...


1420
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:54.300
I shall solemnize this union.

1421
01:58:55.425 --> 01:58:59.258
Do you, Bella Baxter,
take this man as your husband?


1422
01:58:59.425 --> 01:59:02.217
Did we miss the part
about anyone objecting to this?


1423
01:59:02.842 --> 01:59:07.758
Or has that been removed in some kind
of faux modernization of the catechism?


1424
01:59:11.092 --> 01:59:12.508
Hello, Victoria.

1425
01:59:13.258 --> 01:59:14.300
You look well.

1426
01:59:15.467 --> 01:59:17.425
Do you refer to me, sir?

1427
01:59:17.592 --> 01:59:20.300
A man doesn't normally introduce himself
to his wife.


1428
01:59:20.467 --> 01:59:21.925
But if I must...

1429
01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:24.800
He is the God of it.

1430
01:59:25.425 --> 01:59:28.008
I do not know if he's in her power
or she in his.


1431
01:59:28.175 --> 01:59:30.175
'Tis Devil's work at hand.
Look!


1432
01:59:30.342 --> 01:59:33.217
He coughs not air as a normal man
but blood.


1433
01:59:33.383 --> 01:59:35.175
He has cancer, you fucking idiot.

1434
01:59:37.008 --> 01:59:37.842
Duncan.

1435
01:59:38.008 --> 01:59:40.175
Do not lay your eyes on me, demon!

1436
01:59:42.383 --> 01:59:45.800
As I was saying, 
General Alfred Blessington.

1437
01:59:46.592 --> 01:59:48.217
"Alfie" to you.

1438
01:59:48.383 --> 01:59:49.842
You really do not know me?

1439
01:59:51.133 --> 01:59:53.300
When Mr. Wedderburn
put your photo in the paper...


1440
01:59:53.467 --> 01:59:57.883
I remembered that old bird in the hotel
called you Victoria Blessington...


1441
01:59:58.050 --> 02:00:02.300
and I pieced this diabolical fuckfest
of a puzzle together.


1442
02:00:04.300 --> 02:00:06.133
- You are...
- Your dear Alfie.


1443
02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:11.467
You left in a state of some mental addlement
and hysteria over your pregnancy.


1444
02:00:12.675 --> 02:00:15.592
On the discovery of your absence,
I felt disemboweled.


1445
02:00:16.258 --> 02:00:18.758
I have disemboweled men
on the field of battle...


1446
02:00:18.925 --> 02:00:23.258
and I always imagined a dull,
hollow throbbing...


1447
02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:25.800
and that is what it was like.

1448
02:00:26.675 --> 02:00:31.342
There's also a stench,
but that does not apply as a metaphor here.


1449
02:00:32.717 --> 02:00:34.550
But here you are, my darling.

1450
02:00:35.592 --> 02:00:36.467
Here you are.

1451
02:00:37.008 --> 02:00:37.925
God.

1452
02:00:38.092 --> 02:00:39.883
I have no recollection of you.

1453
02:00:40.758 --> 02:00:42.342
I am Bella Baxter.

1454
02:00:42.508 --> 02:00:43.592
Hurtful.

1455
02:00:44.258 --> 02:00:45.717
But perhaps you've hit your head...

1456
02:00:45.883 --> 02:00:48.092
and these men have clearly taken
advantage of you.


1457
02:00:48.258 --> 02:00:50.008
Please go, sir.

1458
02:00:51.758 --> 02:00:54.133
- You were my husband?
- Your dear Alfie.


1459
02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:56.425
Bella, I'm sorry.

1460
02:01:02.592 --> 02:01:04.258
Actually, I would like to go.

1461
02:01:04.842 --> 02:01:05.675
What?

1462
02:01:05.842 --> 02:01:06.717
Bella?

1463
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:12.092
You have a carriage, sir?

1464
02:01:13.217 --> 02:01:14.300
Yes.

1465
02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:15.425
Let us go then.

1466
02:01:15.592 --> 02:01:16.467
Bella!

1467
02:01:16.633 --> 02:01:17.883
Let me go, God.

1468
02:01:18.633 --> 02:01:20.133
Max, you will not stop me.

1469
02:01:29.342 --> 02:01:31.383
It is good to have you back, Victoria.

1470
02:01:47.842 --> 02:01:49.550
The servants and I
have not been getting along.


1471
02:01:49.717 --> 02:01:51.133
I fear an uprising.

1472
02:02:01.217 --> 02:02:02.717
You remember David, darling?

1473
02:02:04.925 --> 02:02:07.175
Allison, look who's back.

1474
02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:15.008
You know me?

1475
02:02:16.842 --> 02:02:18.217
Tell me about myself.

1476
02:02:20.675 --> 02:02:21.800
Was I nice?

1477
02:02:59.133 --> 02:02:59.967
Eat.

1478
02:03:01.508 --> 02:03:02.717
All your favorites.

1479
02:03:02.883 --> 02:03:04.800
Kippers, goose...

1480
02:03:05.592 --> 02:03:08.133
tongue, champagne.

1481
02:03:08.925 --> 02:03:09.925
I've missed you.

1482
02:03:12.008 --> 02:03:14.008
What was the root of the unhappiness?

1483
02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:18.008
What drove her to leap off the bridge?

1484
02:03:20.883 --> 02:03:22.550
You hated the baby.

1485
02:03:22.717 --> 02:03:24.300
You called it "the monster."

1486
02:03:25.508 --> 02:03:26.592
I see.

1487
02:03:28.258 --> 02:03:30.550
I have noticed a lack of maternal instinct.

1488
02:03:32.217 --> 02:03:34.050
And yet I'm happy to have you home.

1489
02:03:36.717 --> 02:03:37.842
How did we meet?

1490
02:03:38.508 --> 02:03:40.008
At a ball.

1491
02:03:40.175 --> 02:03:41.592
Why did we like each other?

1492
02:03:43.175 --> 02:03:45.008
We shared a love of good times.

1493
02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:47.675
Watch.

1494
02:03:49.217 --> 02:03:51.175
Allison, soup!

1495
02:04:00.967 --> 02:04:01.675
Rex!

1496
02:04:07.633 --> 02:04:08.425
Fuck!

1497
02:04:08.592 --> 02:04:09.675
Allison...

1498
02:04:10.425 --> 02:04:12.092
we'll have some cheese when you can.

1499
02:04:18.592 --> 02:04:20.092
A love of cruelty?

1500
02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:25.258
- I was not a kind person, it seems.
- Kind?


1501
02:04:25.883 --> 02:04:27.967
You would never be so dull, Victoria.

1502
02:04:28.133 --> 02:04:29.300
Appalling idea.

1503
02:04:30.508 --> 02:04:31.925
Wedderburn says you were a whore.

1504
02:04:32.092 --> 02:04:33.883
- I suspect that was part...
- I was.


1505
02:04:34.050 --> 02:04:34.883
In Paris.

1506
02:04:35.425 --> 02:04:37.842
I tired of it, but it was fascinating.

1507
02:04:39.175 --> 02:04:41.800
- Right.
- These kippers are strangely delicious.


1508
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:44.342
Vinegary or something.

1509
02:04:51.342 --> 02:04:53.425
Marriage is a constant challenge.

1510
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:56.550
Some, we bend to,
some we bend to us.

1511
02:04:59.217 --> 02:05:01.342
I will try to
forgive you for the whoring.

1512
02:05:02.050 --> 02:05:05.175
Your sexual hysteria was often out of hand.

1513
02:05:05.883 --> 02:05:07.800
And for the killing of our unborn child.

1514
02:05:08.842 --> 02:05:11.300
In fact, when I list the ways
you've wronged me...


1515
02:05:11.467 --> 02:05:15.467
Jesus Christ himself would probably
beat your head in with a bat.


1516
02:05:19.258 --> 02:05:21.050
You're blessed with a forgiving husband.

1517
02:05:22.883 --> 02:05:24.717
I've not wronged you, Alfie...

1518
02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:26.675
as I do not know you.

1519
02:05:26.842 --> 02:05:30.758
Well, you're in luck as I've had a lot
of experience in the field with amnesia.


1520
02:05:30.925 --> 02:05:33.633
Either men who wish to forget
where they were...


1521
02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:35.717
or a mortar exploded nearby...

1522
02:05:35.883 --> 02:05:37.925
ringing their cranium like a church bell.

1523
02:05:38.925 --> 02:05:41.800
I suggest we stick close to the house
for several months...


1524
02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:43.133
maybe a year.

1525
02:05:45.925 --> 02:05:47.592
Until you've made a full recovery.

1526
02:05:50.217 --> 02:05:53.758
I will leave at my leisure,
but I am flattered by your desire to trap me.


1527
02:05:55.967 --> 02:05:57.133
You're not the first.

1528
02:05:59.217 --> 02:06:01.425
I will have to shoot you
in the fucking head...


1529
02:06:02.050 --> 02:06:03.883
if you try to leave, darling.

1530
02:06:04.050 --> 02:06:05.717
The front or the back of the head?

1531
02:06:05.883 --> 02:06:07.217
The back.

1532
02:06:07.383 --> 02:06:08.758
As to be sure you were leaving...

1533
02:06:08.925 --> 02:06:10.717
and I was not being rash.

1534
02:06:16.258 --> 02:06:17.800
I have missed you.

1535
02:06:21.717 --> 02:06:23.508
So, I'm a prisoner?

1536
02:06:24.217 --> 02:06:27.217
This conversation has gone down
an unfortunate route.


1537
02:06:28.258 --> 02:06:31.008
I am sure you will be as happy
as you were before.


1538
02:06:32.342 --> 02:06:34.883
As I was before
when I threw myself from a bridge?


1539
02:06:41.217 --> 02:06:43.925
I suspect you fell while looking for fish.

1540
02:06:45.633 --> 02:06:48.300
Why would you want to keep me here
if I do not wish to stay?


1541
02:06:48.925 --> 02:06:53.258
If one must drown,
let it be in the river of love.


1542
02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:03.967
David...

1543
02:07:05.342 --> 02:07:07.508
does that pheasant look stripped to the bone?

1544
02:07:07.967 --> 02:07:09.800
It was a misjudgment, sir.

1545
02:07:10.425 --> 02:07:11.967
I apologize.

1546
02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:22.175
Dessert, darling?

1547
02:08:20.467 --> 02:08:22.050
It comes off easy?

1548
02:08:22.217 --> 02:08:23.633
Like a button on a suit.

1549
02:08:25.008 --> 02:08:27.300
I saw them do it in Africa
with sharpened rocks...


1550
02:08:27.467 --> 02:08:31.133
but had my own more precise device made.

1551
02:08:32.925 --> 02:08:34.300
Do you want just clitoral hood...

1552
02:08:34.467 --> 02:08:36.050
or glans as well?

1553
02:08:36.217 --> 02:08:38.008
The whole infernal packet.

1554
02:08:38.175 --> 02:08:40.092
It will calm her no end.

1555
02:08:40.258 --> 02:08:41.800
This time we will get it done.

1556
02:08:42.592 --> 02:08:44.758
I shall get her sedated
and bring her to your surgery this evening.


1557
02:08:55.633 --> 02:08:57.925
Victoria, darling!

1558
02:08:59.258 --> 02:09:00.425
Where are you?

1559
02:09:05.925 --> 02:09:07.300
Perfect timing.

1560
02:09:07.467 --> 02:09:08.342
Martini.

1561
02:09:08.508 --> 02:09:09.758
Rather not.

1562
02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:12.217
I would, however, like to leave.

1563
02:09:12.675 --> 02:09:14.717
I have found our time together interesting...

1564
02:09:14.883 --> 02:09:17.425
but I've ascertained
why I jumped from a bridge.


1565
02:09:18.258 --> 02:09:20.800
I wish to go
see my near dead God.

1566
02:09:21.425 --> 02:09:22.383
Adorable idea.

1567
02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:24.050
Unfortunately, my darling...

1568
02:09:24.217 --> 02:09:27.300
my life is dedicated
to the taking of territory.


1569
02:09:27.467 --> 02:09:28.300
You are mine...

1570
02:09:28.467 --> 02:09:30.550
and that is the
long and short of it.

1571
02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.758
I am not territory.

1572
02:09:32.925 --> 02:09:36.550
The root of the
problem is between your legs.

1573
02:09:36.717 --> 02:09:37.717
I will have it off...

1574
02:09:37.883 --> 02:09:40.717
and it will not distract
and divert you anymore.


1575
02:09:40.883 --> 02:09:43.967
You see, a man spends his life
wrangling his sexual compulsions.


1576
02:09:44.133 --> 02:09:47.258
It's a curse and yet,
in some ways, his life's work.


1577
02:09:47.425 --> 02:09:49.467
A woman's life's work is children.

1578
02:09:49.633 --> 02:09:52.633
I intend to rid you of that infernal packet
between your legs...


1579
02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:55.050
and plant a seed in you straight after.

1580
02:09:55.217 --> 02:09:57.467
Let me explain what has happened.

1581
02:09:57.633 --> 02:10:01.467
Victoria, your wife, threw herself
from a bridge and died.


1582
02:10:01.633 --> 02:10:04.675
Godwin Baxter found her,
brought her to his surgery.


1583
02:10:04.842 --> 02:10:07.967
He then removed the baby,
removed the brain from the baby...


1584
02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:11.092
transplanted it into my head
and reanimated me.


1585
02:10:11.550 --> 02:10:13.967
I'll bring you the file.
It's actually quite fascinating.


1586
02:10:14.133 --> 02:10:15.925
However, I will keep my new life...

1587
02:10:16.092 --> 02:10:18.467
and my lovely old clitoris, thank you.

1588
02:10:18.633 --> 02:10:20.258
If you'd call a carriage for me.

1589
02:10:21.092 --> 02:10:22.092
They talk and talk...

1590
02:10:22.258 --> 02:10:24.800
and yet at some point there's nothing left
but to pull a gun.


1591
02:10:26.383 --> 02:10:27.842
'Tis the way with women.

1592
02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:41.675
Are you giving in?

1593
02:10:42.842 --> 02:10:45.800
I'd rather you shot
me in the fucking heart.

1594
02:10:45.967 --> 02:10:48.258
I will oblige if I have to.

1595
02:10:49.883 --> 02:10:51.467
Drink the drink, darling.

1596
02:10:52.342 --> 02:10:53.300
Chloroform and gin.

1597
02:11:03.133 --> 02:11:06.925
In some ways it would be a relief
to be rid of my questing self.


1598
02:11:07.425 --> 02:11:09.883
Sip deeply and that freedom is yours.

1599
02:11:22.633 --> 02:11:23.633
Fuck.

1600
02:11:38.383 --> 02:11:39.383
Max?

1601
02:11:42.592 --> 02:11:45.675
Max. We have to get him to surgery.

1602
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:47.758
He'll die if we don't.

1603
02:11:47.925 --> 02:11:49.008
Bleeding a lot.

1604
02:11:49.175 --> 02:11:51.258
You're fucking dead.

1605
02:11:52.383 --> 02:11:53.967
Bella, if he lives...

1606
02:11:54.133 --> 02:11:57.592
I do not sense he
is a man who will stop.

1607
02:11:58.092 --> 02:11:59.800
Well, I won't watch him bleed to death.

1608
02:12:00.342 --> 02:12:02.383
But I agree, he could do with improvement.

1609
02:12:15.425 --> 02:12:17.425
I've removed the bullet
and stopped the bleeding.


1610
02:12:18.008 --> 02:12:19.342
I have the notes.

1611
02:12:27.425 --> 02:12:29.842
I am never happier
than when I'm in here.

1612
02:13:02.592 --> 02:13:04.050
Bella.

1613
02:13:04.217 --> 02:13:05.425
You're back.

1614
02:13:11.342 --> 02:13:13.800
It was just a story of someone else...

1615
02:13:15.008 --> 02:13:16.508
not Bella Baxter.

1616
02:13:24.467 --> 02:13:27.425
All my life, people's eyes looked at me...

1617
02:13:27.592 --> 02:13:29.550
horror, pity...

1618
02:13:31.258 --> 02:13:32.425
but you.

1619
02:13:39.967 --> 02:13:42.050
It's all very interesting...

1620
02:13:44.092 --> 02:13:45.717
what is happening.

1621
02:14:45.592 --> 02:14:47.508
Anatomy exam is making me nervous.

1622
02:14:47.675 --> 02:14:50.092
I've tested you many times. You know it.

1623
02:14:51.508 --> 02:14:53.508
No one knows anatomy better than you.

1624
02:14:58.133 --> 02:14:59.258
Ladies, gin?

1625
02:15:00.467 --> 02:15:01.133
Please.

1626
02:15:01.675 --> 02:15:02.508
Gin?

1627
02:15:05.342 --> 02:15:07.758
We should get some water for the general.

1628
02:15:13.967 --> 02:15:14.800
Felicity...

1629
02:15:16.175 --> 02:15:17.008
water.
