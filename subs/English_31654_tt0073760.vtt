THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
ISN'T IT ? MONEY ?


64
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.500
YES, MONEY.
BUT HOW--

<i>DON'T YOU WORRY</i>
<i>ABOUT--</i>

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.300
WHAT CONFIDENCE ?
"WHAT CON--"

I WOULD SEE IT.
NOTHING ESCAPES MY EYE.


80

81
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.540
HOW-- WHAT--
WHAT AM I DOING ?


82
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.500
UH,
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING.
FORGOT SOMETHING ?


83
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.540
YES, YOU FORGOT YOUR, UH--
OH, YOUR HAT.


84
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.620
OH, YES.

85
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.660
<i>WAIT A MINUTE.</i>
<i>THIS IS NOT MY HAT.</i>


86
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.140
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I WASN'T EVEN WEARING A HAT.
- OH, TH-THAT'S RIGHT.


87
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.340
THAT'S <i>MY</i> HAT.
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED THAT.


88
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.380
OH, AND TELL
THE BOARD OF REGENTS
TO CHEER UP.


89
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.580
EVERY CLOUD
HAS A SILVER LINING.

90
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.460
DOESN'T IT ?

91
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.420
TYPE SOMETHING.

92
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.380
A LITTLE HIGHER
ON YOUR SIDE.


93
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.420
THAT'S IT.
LEAVE IT RIGHT WHERE IT IS.
PERFECT.


94
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.420
HEY, DEXTER,

YEAH, IT DOES
LOOK PRETTY GOOD,
DOESN'T IT ?


96
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.540

A COW TWICE AS STARVED
AS RUTHYBELLE...


97
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.620
WOULD HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THIS STUFF.


98
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.180
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
THAT ACID TASTE
SHE DOESN'T LIKE.


99
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.620
YOU GET RID OF THAT
AND SHE'LL PROBABLY
LIKE IT.


100
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.500
YEAH.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.


101
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.540
CARRY ON.

102

GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING,

104
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.740
ALL RIGHT, WHERE IS HE ?
HEY, DEAN, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FOOT ?


105
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.300
NEVER MIND MY FOOT.
WHERE IS HE ?
WHO ?


106
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.780
- WHO ? QUIGLEY WHO.
THAT'S WHO.
- ISN'T HE HERE ?


107
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.740
UH, HE'LL BE
A FEW MINUTES LATE.


108
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.260
HE JUST DROPPED BY
THE SUPPLY ROOM TO PICK UP
A FEW MORE TEST TUBES.


109
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.300
YOU MEAN THAT
HE LEAVES YOU PEOPLE ALONE ?


110
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.020
WELL, SURE.
WHY NOT ?


111
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.860
- YEAH.
WE'RE ON THE HONOR SYSTEM.
<i>- ( Cow Mooing )</i>


112
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.380
<i>I SUPPOSE</i> THAT <i>IS</i>
<i>ON THE HONOR SYSTEM TOO.</i>


113
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.380
A COW,
ON THE HONOR SYSTEM ?


114
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.860
HEY, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD,
DEAN HIGGINS.


115
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.900
( All Laughing )
STOP TRYING TO BUTTER ME UP.
I KNOW THAT ISN'T FUNNY.


116
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.860
DEAN, IS THERE ANYTHING
WE CAN DO FOR YOU ?
NO, THERE ISN'T.


117
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.860
I JUST CAME UP HERE TO MAKE
A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT.


118
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.900
BACK TO WORK.

119
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.860
A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT ?
HEY, MAYBE HE'S GOING
TO GIVE QUIGLEY PROMOTION.


120
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.100
YEAH, WOULDN'T
THAT BE SOMETHING.


121
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.940
IF IT ISN'T ASKING
TOO MUCH,


122
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.980
DO YOU THINK I WOULD BE
GOING BEYOND MY PREROGATIVES
AS DEAN OF THIS COLLEGE...


123
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.980
TO ASK YOU
WHAT YOU'RE DOING ?


124
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.060
OH, NO, SIR.

125
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.980
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?


126
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.580
WELL, I'M CRUSHING VITAMINS.
I CAN SEE THAT.
ANY FOOL CAN SEE THAT.


127
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.620
WHAT FOR ?
OH, FOR THE COW, SIR.


128
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.580
EVERYTHING WE DO AROUND HERE
IS FOR THE COW.


129
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.540
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE CRUSHING UP
PERFECTLY GOOD VITAMINS...


130
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.620
TO FEED TO A COW ?

131
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.100
WELL, YES, SIR. THAT'S HOW
WE'RE GONNA CURE RUTHYBELLE'S
NUTRITIONAL PROBLEM.


132
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.140
WHO ?
<i>RUTHYBELLE.</i>
<i>THE COW.</i>


133
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.820
<i>AS YOU CAN SEE,</i>
<i>SHE'S SORT OF SKINNY.</i>


134
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.460
<i>HOPEFULLY WE'LL END UP</i>
<i>WITH A FAT COW.</i>


135
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.820
SO THAT'S WHAT ALL
THIS EXPENSE IS FOR:
TO MAKE A COW FAT.


136
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.180
OH, NOT ONLY FAT, SIR,
BUT A STRONG COW TOO.


137
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.180
- THRILLING, ISN'T IT ?
- I'M OVERWHELMED.


138
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.140
I KNEW YOU WOULD BE.
YOU SEE, IT WAS REALLY
MY IDEA. I THOUGHT SO.


139
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.820
THE KIDS
ARE JUST HELPING ME OUT.
UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.


140
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.420
SHORTY, I NEED ANOTHER PIECE
OF PIZZA. THE FLAVOR'S
NOT QUITE RIGHT YET.


141
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.940
ONE PIECE OF PIZZA
COMING UP.


142
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.060
PIZZA ?
YEAH, AND SHE SEEMS

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.660
HEY ! HARRY,
YOU OLD SON OF A GUN.


566
00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.260
HOW'S LIFE
TREATING YOU ?
COULDN'T BE BETTER.


567
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.220
CHAUFFEURED LIMOUSINE;
PENTHOUSE DOWNTOWN;
FIRST CABIN ALL THE WAY.


568
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.220
AS I SAID,
THINGS COULDN'T BE BETTER.
HOW ABOUT YOU ?


569
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.060
WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE
HAD A TEMPORARY SETBACK, BUT
DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU.


570
00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.420
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK ON TOP
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.
- I KNOW YOU WILL.


571
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.500
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.


572
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.700
OH ? WHAT'S UP ?

573
00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.300
( Nervous Chuckle )
IS HE OKAY ?


574
00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.300
WHO, HIM ?
OH, SURE.


575
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.660
A LITTLE STUPID,
BUT HE'S OKAY.
YOU GONNA
START THAT TALK AGAIN ?


576
00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.700
YOU KEEP THAT UP,
YOU'RE GONNA CAUSE ME
TO LOSE MY CONFIDENCE.


577
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.900
OH, YEAH ?
( Laughing )
HEY, WHAT'S THE CAPER ?


578
00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.500
I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
ON THE WAY TO TOWN. GET IN.


579
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.500
BUT, BOSS, I DON'T CARE
WHAT THAT GUY HARRY SAYS.


580
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.500
EVERY TIME WE GET MIXED UP
WITH THEM MEDFIELD KIDS,
WE END UP IN JAIL,


581
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.900
AND I DON'T WANNA GO
TO JAIL NO MORE.


582
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.900
I DON'T GO FOR THAT
"OUR HOUSE IS YOUR HOUSE"
STUFF ANYMORE.


583
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.940
COOKIE,
NOBODY'S GOIN' TO JAIL.


584
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.940
IT'S A REAL SIMPLE JOB
THAT WE'RE GETTING PAID
A LOT OF MONEY FOR.


585
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.540
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS
FIND OUT WHERE THE FORMULA IS
AND GO IN AND GET IT.


586
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.380
YOU SAY
THAT'S SIMPLE ?
WHY, SURE.


587
00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.820
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT'S SO SIMPLE I'M GONNA
LET YOU HANDLE IT YOURSELF.


588
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.700
YEAH ?
ALL BY MYSELF ?


589
00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.740
<i>ALL BY YOURSELF.</i>

590
00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.860
<i>IT'S A CHANCE</i>
<i>TO PROVE YOURSELF.</i>


591
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.460
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT;
YOU'LL DO THE LEADING;
I'LL DO THE FOLLOWING.


592
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.460
YOU REALLY MEAN THAT, BOSS ?
I DO THE LEADIN',
YOU DO THE FOLLOWIN' ?


593
00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.500
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

594
00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.900
YEAH, I LIKE THAT.

595
00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.300
I LEAD, HE FOLLOWS.

596
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.860
TERRIFIC.

597
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.620
ALL RIGHT,
NOW HERE'S THE PLAN.


598
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.260
WHEN THAT TRUCK LEAVES
WE GO AROUND
THE BACK OF THE BUILDING,


599
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.580
UP ON THE ROOF, OVER ONTO
THE SCAFFOLDING AND DOWN
IN FRONT OF THE LAB WINDOW.


600
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.580
THE FORMULA'S IN THERE.

601
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.500
I DON'T LIKE
THIS SCAFFOLD BUSINESS.


602
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.660
<i>BUT, BOSS,</i>
<i>I CASED THIS JOINT</i>
<i>THIS AFTERNOON.</i>


603
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.620
THE HALLS ARE LOADED
WITH SECURITY GUARDS.


604
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.620
IT'S THE WINDOW OR NOTHIN'.
WE GOTTA USE THE SCAFFOLD.


605
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.620
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT I STILL DON'T LIKE IT.
- HERE. WEAR THESE.


606
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.620
WHAT FOR ?
FOR THE ROPES
OF THE SCAFFOLD.


607
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.900
WHAT,
ARE YOU STUPID ?
WHO'S STUPID ?


608
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.980
I DON'T LIKE
TAKIN' ORDERS FROM YOU.


609
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.780
BUT, BOSS, DON'T YOU REMEMBER
YOU SAID TO ME, "HEY, YOU LEAD
AND I'LL FOLLOW" ?


610
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.940
QUOTE.

611
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.980
YEAH, AND THAT'S THE STUPIDEST
THING I EVER DID IN MY LIFE.


612
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.100
<i>( Door Closes,</i>

HEY, IT'S WINDIER UP HERE
THAN IT IS DOWN THERE.


616
00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.620
YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S HIGHER UP
HERE THAN IT IS DOWN THERE.
I KNOW THAT !

WHAT ARE YOU TRYIN' TO DO,

634
