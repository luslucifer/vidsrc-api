1
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.459
Is that you, Ines?

2
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.859
I said...

3
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.584
Don't play with fire!
You'll get burned!


4
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.309
It doesn't hurt?

5
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.308
It won't hurt me?

6
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.498
Oh God, my dear!
Who did it?


7
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.979
What happened?

8
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.668
50 hours in surgical room.
That's crazy.


9
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.668
Even for you.

10
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.748
Do you think he will forgive me?

11
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.589
He will.

12
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.778
But I won't.

13
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.587
Is it time to get him?

14
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.667
For me?

15
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.183
What do you mean?

16
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.543
A week with you,
in 10 years of our marriage!


17
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.384
- Anais...
- That's all I get.


18
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.342
All happiness belongs to her.

19
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.825
Don't speak anymore with Judith!

20
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.710
Watch out David!

21
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.182
Dr. Martel, do you hear me?

22
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.069
- His name is...
- David.


23
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.908
David?

24
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.907
If you can hear me,
blink your eyes.


25
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.060
Get it out!

26
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.669
- Intracranial nerves?
- There's no broken hematoma.


27
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.541
Scanning?

28
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.825
I want it in my office.

29
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.744
No sweat.
No tears.


30
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.384
They still need eye drops,

31
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.387
or they'll end like him.

32
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.863
What are they doing?

33
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.903
The guilty deserve punishment!

34
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.905
They are OK.

35
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.308
What do you mean?

36
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.829
They are the ones who did it?

37
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.143
Let me show you something.

38
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.899
Are you crazy?

39
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.103
These children don't know pain.

40
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.743
That's why they're very dangerous
to other children,


41
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.861
but mainly to their own selves.

42
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.709
Can we cure it?

43
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.227
I'd never seen anything like this.

44
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.898
They suffer from an unknown illness.

45
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.823
Citizens, I have to tell you that...

46
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.103
These children,
they suffer from an unknown illness.


47
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.338
Tragic events and strange facts
happen for months


48
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.468
and kill innocent people.

49
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.749
This tragedy...

50
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.865
shows ...

51
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.106
the threat posed by crime.

52
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.462
These children are dangerous to us.

53
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.829
Also to their own selves.

54
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.410
We can't cure it.

55
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.059
Therefore,

56
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.578
I have to tell you...

57
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.543
that we've decided for their sake,

58
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.701
to lock them up indefinitely.

59
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.026
Benigno!

60
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:02.881
David!

61
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.821
Stand up.

62
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.624
Where's Anais?

63
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.058
Let's go!

64
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.466
Anais didn't make it.

65
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.101
But we save a child.

66
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.819
Your child.

67
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.345
Don't move!

68
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.142
Make them wear it.

69
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.705
Tell them to wear the safety clothes.

70
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.465
Every cell should be empty and clean.

71
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.989
Free from anything.

72
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.305
This is for your own sake.

73
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.183
The lock will be opened at meal time.

74
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.942
You'll be safe here.

75
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.664
No one will be punished.

76
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.182
David, what are you doing?

77
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.099
You're still not allowed to work yet.

78
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.586
David!

79
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.428
Do you hear me?

80
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.463
Take a look!

81
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.428
Why do you show me lymph gland?

82
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.988
You're not qualified for this.

83
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.628
It's not my specialization.
It's oncology.


84
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.269
It's not my patient.

85
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:05.465
We found it unintentionally.

86
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.787
You still have a chance
to save your life.


87
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.824
I survived from the accident!

88
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.742
Lymphoma cells,
nothing's bad


89
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:30.939
It's not lymphoma.

90
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.745
So you know exactly nothing can be done.

91
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.464
An experimental technique has proved...

92
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.785
Impossible!

93
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.424
Bone marrow transplant never pass

94
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.098
Your both parents are still alive.

95
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.780
I've seen more.
They are old, I can't ask them.


96
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.345
You have to!
It's your only chance to live.


97
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.218
Live...

98
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.502
You have a child now.

99
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:10.860
A child...

100
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.628
Judith just had been pregnant
for 6 months.


101
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.185
She died.
I don't know if he can make through it.


102
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.026
He lives.

103
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.107
And he'll need a dad.

104
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.188
Be careful, it's hot!

105
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.698
What's this?

106
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.462
Tears, cutie.

107
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.461
It comes out when someone's happy,

108
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:47.939
or in pain.

109
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.104
What is pain?

110
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.583
The opposite of happiness.

111
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.262
What is that?

112
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.108
Happiness, my dear.

113
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.979
Happiness.

114
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.870
Doctor,
for how long they will be locked?


115
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.548
They can't be cured.
It's the only solution.


116
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.863
And Dr. Holzmann...

117
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.741
Holzmann?

118
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:49.986
If you can help, do it.

119
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.661
If you believe what I say...

120
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.101
A well known scientist
will never come here!


121
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.585
I don't ask him to support this.

122
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.984
I have pride!

123
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.499
If it doesn't bother you...

124
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.099
If you have spare time,
contact him.


125
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.186
I'll approve it.

126
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.988
How will you contact him?

127
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.541
I'll see later.

128
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.780
There's another thing
that I need to tell you.


129
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.308
I suffer from prolymphocytic leukemia.

130
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:14.427
There's a treatment that can save me
but it's done with high radiation.


131
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:18.145
A radical treatment by
destroying the main cell


132
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.784
and it needs
bone marrow transplantation.


133
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.429
Transplantation...

134
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.865
should be from one of you.

135
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.618
If not...

136
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.468
it will torture me till I die.

137
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.580
You can answer later.

138
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.462
I clearly understand.

139
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.660
You're asking us...

140
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.742
It's impossible, my dear.

141
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.625
If I have choices,
I won't ask anything.


142
00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:14.546
Dad!

143
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.465
What happened?

144
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.823
Your dad and I, we need to talk.

145
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.384
Talk about what?

146
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.098
Ines!

147
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.499
Ines!

148
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.421
Hello dear!

149
00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.539
I am Hubert.

150
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.583
Hubert Holzmann.

151
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:44.423
We need to moisten the eyes.
They don't have tears.


152
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.904
Anhydrosis...

153
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.226
Sometime it destroys cornea?

154
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.140
Right, two children become blind.

155
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.068
The others, using their saliva...

156
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.660
They are saved,
but they have chronic conjunctivitis.


157
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.259
Pre-cognitive mechanism.

158
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.220
Interesting!

159
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.541
You must be Dr. Carcedo.

160
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.502
Professor Holzmann!

161
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.744
Sorry for my intrusion...

162
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.349
I hope...

163
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.222
to see them with my own eyes.

164
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.500
You're my special partner.

165
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.507
Sorry to make you wait so long.

166
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.940
It's not easy to come here from Germany.

167
00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.505
There's a good place near here.

168
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.541
We'll take your luggage.

169
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.785
No need.

170
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.140
No luggage? How could it be?

171
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.548
I'll stay with you
as long as it needs.


172
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.469
We'll save the children together.

173
00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.025
I have an idea.

174
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.028
The only thing I ask you is...

175
00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.148
your kindness.

176
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.222
Jude

177
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.543
What's on your mind?

178
00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.180
These children,
they have similarity for some anomalies.


179
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.982
The test shows

180
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.705
neuronal activities of
sensor fiber beta A


181
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.741
<i>is zero.</i>

182
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.422
They can't be cured,
and that's the fact.


183
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.184
But I think

184
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.779
a special education program is needed

185
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.742
as rehabilitation.

186
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.510
<i>For some years,
they have to be able...</i>


187
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.019
to live a normal life.

188
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.347
This concept is pretty simple.

189
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.939
These children don't know pain.

190
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.789
That's why they're dangerous.

191
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.744
They can't live outside.

192
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.948
That's why...

193
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.384
we need to teach them
what they don't know


194
00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.826
The thing called pain.

195
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.740
Benigno!

196
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.218
What are you doing?

197
00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:26.265
Show me your hands!

198
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.228
Both of you can't feel any pain.

199
00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:32.699
You evil!

200
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.065
Are you crazy?

201
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.541
I'll tell Dr. Carcedo.

202
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.218
You can tell him anything you want.

203
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.658
Anytime!

204
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.301
Your mom is waiting outside.

205
00:34:30.390 --> 00:34:31.618
It's a miracle.

206
00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:36.745
It's a miracle to breath using machine.

207
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.065
It's your child.

208
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.869
Why do you come?

209
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.106
You know,
your dad doesn't like to talk...


210
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.261
Don't make any excuse for him!

211
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:52.745
He wants the best for you.

212
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:55.145
He doesn't say no to help you.

213
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.865
What he means is we can't.

214
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:15.418
It's a long story,
in 60s, your dad...


215
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:19.425
He worked in a jail near Canfranc.

216
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:20.779
He's a police, right?

217
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:26.504
I was pregnant that time.
I gave birth to a child who's already dead.


218
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.142
It was so hard for me, but Adan...

219
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.026
I thought, he's going crazy.

220
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.902
Soon after that,
a miracle happened.


221
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:40.704
I go to bed.

222
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:44.027
And I was awake with
a baby in my arms.

223
00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:46.705
It's you.

224
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.699
Who are my real parents?

225
00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:02.909
Ad├ín never talks about your real dad.

226
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.665
It's about your mother, once...

227
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:07.780
Who?

228
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.979
I don't know.

229
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.385
He's trapped in Canfranc.

230
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.741
I don't know if he's still alive.
I don't know anything.


231
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:21.266
Your dad made me promise
to never tell you.


232
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:53.780
Calm down!

233
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.228
Calm down!

234
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.063
One of the puppies...

235
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.785
It has tumor in its left kidney.

236
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.622
Who can tell me which one is it?

237
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.903
Good!

238
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.703
And now...

239
00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.343
Who can take out the kidney
without hurting the puppy?


240
00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.828
This puppy isn't given any anesthetic.

241
00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.260
Professor!

242
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.861
Can I take care of it, Professor?

243
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:39.788
No! It's not for you.

244
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:43.107
It's time to go back into your cells.

245
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.066
No need to be so hard on him.

246
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.738
For heaven's sake, Hubert!
What's the use of doing this?


247
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.148
They are amazing.
They are different.


248
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.299
I know.

249
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:01.139
Every time problem arises,
It's always both of them.


250
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:04.148
The problem is you tell me nothing.

251
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.266
I hope you know what you're doing.

252
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.579
I won't tolerate
any trouble in my school.


253
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.224
Ines!

254
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.105
Look!

255
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.739
Benigno!

256
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.981
Oh God!

257
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.619
What are you doing?

258
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.708
Benigno, please...

259
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:15.429
Give it to me!

260
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:32.024
You evil!

261
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:34.982
Enough! He's just a child.

262
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.704
I say he's a devil.

263
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.548
It's allowed in this program.

264
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.820
He is to never leave his cell!

265
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.100
Treat yourself as scientist!

266
00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:45.538
We have to keep going on.

267
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.422
Damn you!

268
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.188
How dare you?

269
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.426
Do you even know
who I am in Germany?

270
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.383
I know who you are in Germany.

271
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:55.943
Professor Holzmann.

272
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.944
We both know why I am here.

273
00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:07.265
Professor?

274
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.380
- Dr. Carcedo said...
- I know!


275
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.621
I know what he said.

276
00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.707
Stay here and you'll get more.

277
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.346
Association of CNT

278
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.259
Foods? Medicine?
There are 30 of my patients.


279
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.461
- What will they do?
- We'll see later.


280
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:59.504
We don't get any of it anymore.
Administration can't be accessed.


281
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.100
There are bunch of administration,
or should I called it government.


282
00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.700
There are people on the other side,
and fascists on the other side.


283
00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:08.425
Which side are you?

284
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.901
Let the children go!

285
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:16.540
We'll put the ammunition here.

286
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.627
The children should be locked
no matter what happens.


287
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:22.027
One child per cell,
it's too much!


288
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.504
Place all of them together!

289
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:25.926
Excuse me,
I'm the one who's responsible of this


290
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.590
and I'm the one
who decide everything to be done.


291
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.587
They have to stay where they are.

292
00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:36.578
You dirty bourgeois!

293
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.389
They suffer a very serious illness.

294
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.378
It's very contagious.

295
00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.581
They should always be isolated.

296
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:51.025
Wait!

297
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:53.186
Don't touch them! 
They are contagious.

298
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:59.859
Let's go!

299
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.067
Thank you.

300
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:38.781
I'm sorry.

301
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.585
Hello!

302
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:23.065
I'm David Martel.
I'm looking for association...


303
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:24.589
What do you want?

304
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.821
It's a long story.

305
00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:31.227
OK?

306
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.589
Do you want some cognac?

307
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:46.062
It's a quite ogrish jail.

308
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.426
If your mom lost in cell 17...

309
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.744
I'm not sure
you'll find your real identity.


310
00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.469
Who is he?

311
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.943
Peinado Solera. A Century.
Want some?


312
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:10.222
I have to find him.
My life depends on him.


313
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.865
Do you know why?

314
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.945
Cain killed Abel?

315
00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:28.506
Excuse me?

316
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.459
It's the first murder of human being
that will never be paid...


317
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:33.103
till the end of time.

318
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:34.580
That murder...

319
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.340
It's a jealousy between brothers.

320
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.024
It's the same with Spain.

321
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.389
What happened during the civil war

322
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.263
is not the worst thing.

323
00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:50.543
The worst came after.

324
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.383
Cain,

325
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.229
He didn't do it just to win.

326
00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.905
You know,
the old belief to purify the blood


327
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:09.702
To destroy it...

328
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.184
completely.

329
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:18.028
Destroying red chromosome

330
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:22.581
No flower.

331
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.828
No one really tries to know the truth.

332
00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:31.228
What important is to forget it.

333
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:34.549
Lupa untuk bertahan hidup.

334
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:37.979
Tempatnya...

335
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.388
sebagai sel 17...

336
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.180
dilarang di buku-buku sejarah.

337
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:46.659
I...

338
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:53.943
My brother, Jose...

339
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:57.264
He was in jail of Canfranc.

340
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:59.543
As I know...

341
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:02.824
It's the only place

342
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.863
to be thrown alive
from cell 17.


343
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:12.426
So he's alive?

344
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.225
Can I talk with him?

345
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.862
Something's suspicious here.

346
00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:00.909
Take off your clothes!

347
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:07.068
Take it off, bastard!

348
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:14.102
The children too!

349
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.108
Put those down!

350
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:22.148
In order, you bastard!

351
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:54.382
Who's the manager here?

352
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.185
Shoot her!

353
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:12.349
Captain!

354
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:16.945
I'm Professor Hubert Holzmann.

355
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.268
Stuttgart University.
I learn about children.


356
00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:23.420
I really love that.

357
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:26.140
They're so special.

358
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:30.306
Really?

359
00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:33.946
How are they special?

360
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.030
They were born with
insensibility of pain.


361
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:41.905
They don't know pain.

362
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:45.580
The knowledge about this illness...

363
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:48.186
can be useful for Germany.

364
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:51.429
Reich.

365
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:53.782
- In...
- Wait!


366
00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.422
He's Germany.

367
00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:01.339
Let him go!

368
00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:03.066
The children too!

369
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:06.825
We're in Spain.

370
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:08.543
I'm the one to order.

371
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.945
Let them go!

372
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:17.829
You and your people...

373
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.349
stay here...

374
00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:20.699
and shoot us.

375
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:22.628
I'll repeat my question.

376
00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:25.822
Who's the manager here?

377
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:38.466
Me.

378
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:41.701
I'm the manager.

379
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:43.505
Fine.

380
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.109
The nurses too.

381
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:04.861
I need them for my research.

382
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:21.665
Ready...

383
00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:25.867
Shoot!

384
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.502
We've talked.

385
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:07.543
I'm not here to judge or blame you.

386
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:11.785
What you've done is a good deed.

387
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:16.668
But if you want
to give me a chance,

388
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:17.939
you have to help me.

389
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:25.548
If you find yourself...
admit...


390
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:30.340
that it is life...

391
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:33.546
Do you think...

392
00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:37.305
that everything is the same
just like before?


393
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:41.387
My feeling for you never changes.

394
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:46.701
Dad, I know you don't like
to remember the past...


395
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:51.108
But I've talked with the leader of CNT.

396
00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:55.699
His brother, Jose, was jailed in Canfranc
when you worked there.


397
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:57.138
I'll meet him tomorrow.

398
00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:00.420
Is he still alive?

399
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.905
Maybe he knows something.

400
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:07.023
Do you know him?

401
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:13.224
I know you're hurt
but if you know something that can save me...


402
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:14.989
Save you?

403
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:19.587
There are only madness and sadness.

404
01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.901
It's my only chance to stay alive.

405
01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:26.782
You're right.

406
01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:29.943
Sometimes you need to forget it.

407
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:34.029
Don't even try to start!
There's no more past.


408
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.743
What did you find?

409
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:38.059
Tell me, Dad.

410
01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:42.061
The one you're looking for
is already dead.


411
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:45.349
Whatever you do,

412
01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:48.144
it's just a waste.

413
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.903
You don't know what I mean.

414
01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.065
I want to help...

415
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:57.305
but I can't.

416
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:58.579
You already know.

417
01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:02.870
Your real mother is here, beside you.

418
01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:05.946
How can you know that he's dead?

419
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.105
Did you see his corpse?

420
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:09.661
You know him, right?

421
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:11.508
You know his name.

422
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.429
You hide the truth since the beginning.

423
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:20.464
Just stop David,
that man is no longer in the world, my son.


424
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:21.898
Believe me.

425
01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:25.147
You're hurt,
don't make your mother be hurt too!


426
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:27.703
You're lying.

427
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:32.545
I smell lie.
This house is full of lies.


428
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.827
David, wait!
Please.


429
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:36.099
I beg you!

430
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:40.343
There should be another solution.

431
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:43.740
Which one?

432
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:47.098
Nothing.

433
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:51.862
Penicillin and foods,
all is for his subordinates.


434
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:55.098
That bastard who's gonna kill all of us.

435
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:03.066
We can send them home.

436
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:06.262
This is civil war, Magdalena.

437
01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:09.708
Maybe they are already dead.

438
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:55.346
God forgive us.

439
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:37.459
Benigno...

440
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:39.545
Sweetie.

441
01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:44.463
This...

442
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.547
It'll help you to sleep.

443
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:19.421
Give me the key.

444
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:23.509
Is it the only one?

445
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:43.699
Oh God!

446
01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:49.029
Someone's here!

447
01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:18.179
Did you do that?

448
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:31.827
You don't talk?

449
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:37.869
What kind of symbol is this?

450
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:40.140
I think it's symbol for jerry.

451
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.949
Berkano...

452
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:54.504
Now you're called Berkano.

453
01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:59.499
Ber-ka-no.

454
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:04.948
Do you know what
it means in our myth?

455
01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:09.109
Revolution.

456
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.464
12 trains are attacked...

457
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.149
in just a year.

458
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:28.383
13 tons of tungsten evaporate.

459
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:32.060
52 of us are dead.

460
01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:35.545
I ask you for the last time.

461
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:39.622
We know you're french.
Where's your headquarter?


462
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:41.658
Captain Whitely.

463
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:43.260
10 battalions,

464
01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:45.424
Second quarter?

465
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:47.823
Squadron C

466
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.906
Squadron C?

467
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.105
You're one of Special Air Service (SAS), right?

468
01:12:57.230 --> 01:12:59.027
SAS or not,

469
01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:00.665
for me...

470
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:04.260
you're not even soldier,
just a dirty terrorist.


471
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:07.304
Why should I tell you, bastard!

472
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.990
Enough, kill them!

473
01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:13.305
A confession?

474
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:14.979
Really?

475
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:21.186
Berkano?

476
01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:01.306
It's a confession

477
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:03.262
and I'll tell you everything.

478
01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:42.108
Don't go near him!
Don't touch the curtain!


479
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:45.741
Give him time to answer.

480
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:50.228
He'll be very tired because of his condition.

481
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:53.422
Ask what you want to know,
make it simple!


482
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:22.909
Please.

483
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:26.180
Halo, Jose.

484
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:27.584
I am David.

485
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.418
David Martel.

486
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:33.702
I'm looking for someone
you may already know.


487
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:35.548
What do you want to know?

488
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:37.308
It's about my mother.

489
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.226
She's jailed at Canfranc in 60s,

490
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:43.022
when I was born.

491
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:44.424
Sorry...

492
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:48.259
I remember that place as a horrible one...

493
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:50.540
I don't understand.

494
01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:52.549
Berkano...

495
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:53.819
Berkano?

496
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:57.824
Who's Berkano?

497
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:02.064
Is it him?

498
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.342
He's weird.

499
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.063
He never talks.

500
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:08.908
He doesn't know pain.

501
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:13.099
How could you get out of there alive?

502
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:17.822
As time passed...

503
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:20.339
his body also changed a lot.

504
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:24.420
He crawled into the hole.

505
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:29.342
A hole full of dirt.

506
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:40.420
Have you seen him?

507
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:44.305
Confessor!

508
01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.464
I know everything.

509
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:04.106
Tell me the truth.
Who's Berkano?


510
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:06.585
My mother was in cell 17?

511
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:11.187
I'll be there in an hour.
You're gonna tell me.


512
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:14.587
Understand? No matter if you like or hate it,
I'll tell everything!


513
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:41.703
Please...

514
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:44.142
I beg you...

515
01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:46.345
Communism,

516
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:48.506
it's a mental disorder.

517
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.462
Degeneration biologically...

518
01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:54.583
We need to do some surgical operation

519
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.579
by cutting your flesh.

520
01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:01.666
I don' know they're communists.

521
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:03.984
I swear!

522
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:23.901
Since when do you work with communist?
Talk!


523
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:09.584
Shut up!

524
01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:49.302
Aku bapa pengakuan mu.

525
01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:51.069
Dan kau akan ceritakan semuanya.

526
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:59.903
I want the names of your leaders.
Their real names.


527
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:15.062
In my investigation,
there's always people who's gonna feel the pain...


528
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:16.749
from a simple question.

529
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:19.418
And today, it's your turn.

530
01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:38.618
Do you know what terror is, David?

531
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:45.024
Your eyes...

532
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:48.820
Your green eyes were creepy...

533
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:52.101
When you're still a child,

534
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:56.781
you stared at me, quietly and widely,
as if...


535
01:24:58.230 --> 01:24:59.709
you knew everything.

536
01:25:02.190 --> 01:25:04.385
These eyes are not mine.

537
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:09.143
Or even your mother's.

538
01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:13.707
Imagine that the one you
love the most in the world

539
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:16.943
has those eyes...

540
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:21.984
Despite of that,
I love you like my own,


541
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:25.061
like my own child.

542
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:29.427
You want to know the truth, David.

543
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:34.263
You know.

544
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:49.309
Cell evacuation.

545
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:36.662
I get an order.

546
01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:38.299
Move!

547
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:39.784
Don't do anything against me...

548
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:15.385
Listen to me.

549
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:21.298
Let's make a deal.

550
01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:27.061
If you give me a child,
I'll let you off.


551
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:30.258
I'll leave you in peace forever.

552
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:33.183
Trust my words.

553
01:35:57.670 --> 01:35:59.422
I will never know.

554
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:02.540
I don't even know your name

555
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:06.186
But I see your eyes

556
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:09.785
like the way your father looks at me.

557
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:13.345
Now, the story is yours.

558
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.900
Therefore...

559
01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:17.109
you're free.

560
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:18.420
Therefore...

561
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:20.982
you're a man.

562
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:22.546
My son.
