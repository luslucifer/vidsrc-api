1
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.613
Swamp Rabbits shorthanded
in a situation


2
00:00:04.613 --> 00:00:09.713
where they need three goals in
just under 2 and 1/2 minutes.


3
00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:12.701
Right now trying to
prevent any further damage.


4
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:13.697
Here's Anderson.

5
00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:15.463
The last of the
goals that he scored


6
00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:17.490
came off of the stick
of the number three.


7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.823
Somoza trying to turn this
into a shorthanded breakaway.


8
00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:21.533
He comes charging forward.

9
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.288
Great reaching play by
the captain in Cherniwchan


10
00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:29.023
to jump back avoid the backcheck
reach the stick in there


11
00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:32.098
and break up what could have
been a one on one scenario.


12
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.203
Hey bud, what can I get for you?

13
00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.243
Did you want something, man?

14
00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:54.981
Cherniwchan feeds
it to the middle,


15
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.463
save made off the
pass to Hrenak.


16
00:00:57.463 --> 00:00:59.293
Backhands it around
over to the near side.


17
00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.873
Picked up by Hamonic.

18
00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:03.633
It'll slide forward and get
the clear all the way down,


19
00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:06.183
stopping at his wall, quickly
paddling it ahead to Fortin


20
00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:08.773
again.

21
00:01:08.773 --> 00:01:11.201
1:12 left, 1:43 in the game.

22
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:13.443
I think they're trying
to burn some time here.


23
00:01:13.443 --> 00:01:14.553
We're kind of in a one--

24
00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:15.823
Hey, I know you.

25
00:01:15.823 --> 00:01:18.873
You played with us a
couple seasons ago.


26
00:01:18.873 --> 00:01:20.313
Roley, right?

27
00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.453
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:22.503
Well, it's Riley.

29
00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:23.563
Riley, dang it, yeah.

30
00:01:23.563 --> 00:01:24.723
Yeah, and you're?

31
00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:26.553
I'm Matt, but everyone
calls me Proton.


32
00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:27.453
Right, sorry.

33
00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:28.233
I should have remembered that.

34
00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:28.893
That's all right.

35
00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:29.793
Dude, how've you been, man?

36
00:01:29.793 --> 00:01:31.085
I haven't seen you at the rink.

37
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:32.043
Yeah, good.

38
00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:34.563
Work's kept me busy, so
yeah, I haven't really


39
00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:36.063
been able to make
it back out there.


40
00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:36.813
Yeah.

41
00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:39.823
Well, funny timing, what
are you doing tonight?


42
00:01:39.823 --> 00:01:41.293
I just moved into
a new apartment,


43
00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:42.693
so I'm still unpacking.

44
00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:43.533
Dude, I hate moving.

45
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.313
It's the worst.

46
00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.203
Yeah, I'm not exactly
looking forward to it.


47
00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:46.983
Yeah.

48
00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:49.173
Well, hey, assuming the
guys didn't scare you off,


49
00:01:49.173 --> 00:01:51.813
um, you want to come
sub for us tonight?


50
00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:52.933
I don't know.

51
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.633
I haven't really played since
the last time you saw me.


52
00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:57.363
I feel like I'd do
more harm than good.


53
00:01:57.363 --> 00:01:58.533
Nah, dude, you were solid.

54
00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:01.263
We'd love to have an
extra guy on the bench.


55
00:02:01.263 --> 00:02:02.653
I've just got a lot to do.

56
00:02:02.653 --> 00:02:03.153
I get it.

57
00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:05.223
It's like a super late game too.

58
00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:07.583
It's like 11:00 PM, I think.

59
00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:08.083
Oh wow.

60
00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:10.383
Yeah, yeah, I'm just really
behind on the move-in.


61
00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:11.263
Dude, I get it.

62
00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:11.883
I get it.

63
00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:14.293
Hey, if you change your mind,
you know where to find us.


64
00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.663
And I think I still
have your number.


65
00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:18.523
Let's see.

66
00:02:18.523 --> 00:02:19.303
Yeah.

67
00:02:19.303 --> 00:02:20.503
Riley New Guy.

68
00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:21.673
That's you, right?

69
00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:22.243
Hey.

70
00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:23.788
Here, I'll call you.

71
00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.483
Yep, still got it.

72
00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:27.983
Hockey Matt.

73
00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:28.533
I like that.

74
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:29.693
That's awesome.

75
00:02:29.693 --> 00:02:30.803
Well, I better get going.

76
00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:32.063
All right, man, well,
it's good to see you.


77
00:02:32.063 --> 00:02:32.933
Yeah.

78
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:35.890
Hey, I mean, those boxes
aren't going anywhere.


79
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.973
I mean, a good sweat could
help you out, you know?


80
00:02:37.973 --> 00:02:40.343
Warren puts it off the pass.

81
00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:42.473
Back to even strength.

82
00:02:42.473 --> 00:02:44.963
Out of the box is Ierullo
This is shoveled forward


83
00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:45.713
looking for him.

84
00:02:45.713 --> 00:02:47.633
He gloves it down
out of the air.


85
00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.013
Looks up, looks for help.

86
00:02:49.013 --> 00:02:51.863
Sees backside of changes
coming and unsuspecting


87
00:02:51.863 --> 00:02:54.713
what he's been as he was
stepping over the boards.


88
00:02:54.713 --> 00:02:59.688
Ierullo down the right hand
wing, poked away by Maass.


89
00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.558
A bitter rivalry.

90
00:03:21.558 --> 00:03:23.867
Oh, I'll tell you what.

91
00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:37.124
I'm sayin' somethin'

92
00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:38.597
I'd be somebody else

93
00:03:38.597 --> 00:03:40.561
Shouted down dusty halls

94
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.034
I'm saying somethin'

95
00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:43.998
Always heard someone else

96
00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:45.471
Back when life
was lived in color


97
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:47.435
And my minutes could be counted

98
00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.381
I'm saying something else:

99
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:56.990
I'm using someone now

100
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.483
I think I'm breaking

101
00:03:58.483 --> 00:04:01.175
Maybe breaking out

102
00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:10.542
Slightly cracking

103
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.667
Inside there's someone else

104
00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.500
Desperately pacing!

105
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.965
I can't do nothing else

106
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:18.923
Oh isn't it great to
be erasing it all?


107
00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:21.388
Until there's nothing else

108
00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:24.839
I knew it'd be the same when

109
00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:26.668
My voice was wearing out again

110
00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:27.793
I'd wiped out all my gains-

111
00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:33.473
I'm using someone now

112
00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.943
I think I'm breaking

113
00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:41.803
Maybe breaking out

114
00:04:41.803 --> 00:04:43.513
Slightly cracking

115
00:04:43.513 --> 00:04:46.728
Inside someone else

116
00:05:12.743 --> 00:05:14.363
Just fucking do it.

117
00:05:14.363 --> 00:05:14.963
It's hockey.

118
00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:15.638
You like hockey.

119
00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:22.733
Just fucking do it.

120
00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:25.153
You got this.

121
00:05:25.153 --> 00:05:26.503
Reflected.

122
00:05:26.503 --> 00:05:28.193
Mirror reflected.

123
00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:28.693
What?

124
00:05:28.693 --> 00:05:29.503
No.

125
00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:31.730
You're not a superhero.

126
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.563
pretend.

127
00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:41.313
Absorbed your energy.

128
00:05:41.313 --> 00:05:42.543
That's my energy now.

129
00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:44.823
You don't have it.

130
00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:47.763
You're not freaking Dr. Strange.

131
00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:48.363
Not yet.

132
00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:49.351
Not never.

133
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:51.393
Dr. is more
like it.


134
00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:55.173
I just don't understand why
they put these games so goddamn


135
00:05:55.173 --> 00:05:55.685
late.

136
00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:57.393
You know what I don't
fucking understand?


137
00:05:57.393 --> 00:06:00.573
Why the fuck did you pack this
and you didn't roll a fucking


138
00:06:00.573 --> 00:06:01.383
joint?

139
00:06:01.383 --> 00:06:03.153
I was just in a hurry, man.

140
00:06:03.153 --> 00:06:04.383
Dunny had me working late.

141
00:06:04.383 --> 00:06:07.293
You're pissing me off
is what you're doing.


142
00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:09.903
Fucking hurry, my ass.

143
00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:14.083
Just fucking smoke it so we
can go get our asses whooped.


144
00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:16.213
I'm not even in the mood
for Chet shit tonight.


145
00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:16.933
Oh shit.

146
00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:17.837
Who's that?

147
00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:22.803
Wait, was he looking over?

148
00:06:22.803 --> 00:06:23.823
I don't know, dude.

149
00:06:23.823 --> 00:06:24.753
Just chill out.

150
00:06:24.753 --> 00:06:26.448
Who the fuck is that guy?

151
00:06:39.053 --> 00:06:39.683
Casey.

152
00:06:39.683 --> 00:06:42.263
Yo Chet, what's up, man?

153
00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:43.013
What's up, dude?

154
00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:44.063
How are you?

155
00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:44.658
Good, you?

156
00:06:44.658 --> 00:06:45.783
It's been a long time, man.

157
00:06:45.783 --> 00:06:46.575
I'm good, I'm good.

158
00:06:46.575 --> 00:06:47.363
Yeah, no kidding.

159
00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:48.869
Boys are pumped
to have you here.


160
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:56.091
But uh...just a little late

161
00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.033
Fuck this.

162
00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:21.103
Dude, you made it.

163
00:07:21.103 --> 00:07:21.816
Yeah, I'm here.

164
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.233
Can't find the
right room, though.


165
00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:24.283
Oh, that's awesome.

166
00:07:24.283 --> 00:07:24.943
No, no worries.

167
00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:26.360
We're in this one
right over here.


168
00:07:32.423 --> 00:07:33.803
What's up, you sexy boys?

169
00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:34.523
There he is.

170
00:07:34.523 --> 00:07:35.813
How are you doing?

171
00:07:35.813 --> 00:07:36.563
So good.

172
00:07:36.563 --> 00:07:38.753
Oh hey, I got us a sub tonight.

173
00:07:38.753 --> 00:07:40.193
You guys remember Riley?

174
00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.303
Oh yeah.

175
00:07:41.303 --> 00:07:42.623
About a year ago, right?

176
00:07:42.623 --> 00:07:45.083
Yeah, but just for a game.

177
00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:45.713
Yeah.

178
00:07:45.713 --> 00:07:48.083
Yeah, you paid in full.

179
00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:50.003
Man, I tried to contact
you a bunch after,


180
00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:52.673
but I must have
had the wrong info.


181
00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:55.163
Yeah, I can't remember
what happened exactly.


182
00:07:55.163 --> 00:07:57.743
So I'm John, if
you don't remember.


183
00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:01.283
And that's Nick over there,
but let him approach you.


184
00:08:01.283 --> 00:08:03.683
He's got a bit of
a pre-game routine.


185
00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:04.343
Got it.

186
00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:05.333
Yeah.

187
00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:08.243
And this rude ginger
here, that's Kevin.


188
00:08:08.243 --> 00:08:11.153
I'd advise not letting
him approach you at all.


189
00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:15.023
Dude, I'm strawberry blonde.

190
00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:17.213
What's up, bro.

191
00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:18.533
I'm Kevin.

192
00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:21.783
Basically the only
funny guy on the team.


193
00:08:21.783 --> 00:08:22.583
Nice to meet you.

194
00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:24.443
Totally.

195
00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:26.363
Oh John, John, John,
is it cool if I


196
00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:27.623
get your back up stick again?

197
00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:30.153
Dude, this is the
third game in a row.


198
00:08:30.153 --> 00:08:31.473
Get a new stick.

199
00:08:31.473 --> 00:08:33.032
I can just go home.

200
00:08:33.032 --> 00:08:34.772
Yeah, you can.

201
00:08:34.772 --> 00:08:36.542
All right, man.

202
00:08:36.542 --> 00:08:37.833
Yes.

203
00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:40.113
Hey, no slapshots though.

204
00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:42.123
What about my heater?

205
00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:43.353
What heater?

206
00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:46.353
Oh, you'll see.

207
00:08:46.353 --> 00:08:48.153
Game's at 11:00, right?

208
00:08:48.153 --> 00:08:52.143
Yeah, we're not really like
the warming up kind of team.


209
00:08:52.143 --> 00:08:55.383
Guys tend to trickle in,
like, right before puck drop.


210
00:08:55.383 --> 00:08:57.003
How many guys are you expecting?

211
00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.233
Counting you?

212
00:08:58.233 --> 00:08:59.613
Seven, maybe eight.

213
00:08:59.613 --> 00:09:00.168
Yikes.

214
00:09:00.168 --> 00:09:02.043
I'll try not to weigh
you guys down too much.


215
00:09:02.043 --> 00:09:03.335
Dude, don't even sweat it, man.

216
00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:04.893
We're just glad you're here.

217
00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:06.033
Maybe eight?

218
00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:07.533
Who's the maybe?

219
00:09:07.533 --> 00:09:08.403
Jason.

220
00:09:09.603 --> 00:09:11.253
Dude.

221
00:09:11.253 --> 00:09:12.933
Dude, Jason's not coming, man.

222
00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:14.073
No chance.

223
00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:14.973
No way, man.

224
00:09:14.973 --> 00:09:16.383
He's right.

225
00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:18.693
It'll be seven plus Nick.

226
00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:20.073
Why so many no shows?

227
00:09:20.073 --> 00:09:22.816
Dude, it's just
the late game, man.


228
00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:24.483
It's like pulling
teeth with these guys.


229
00:09:24.483 --> 00:09:26.163
Oh God, here we go.

230
00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:30.593
John, just do it man,
before, anyone else shows up.


231
00:09:30.593 --> 00:09:33.023
I don't know if you have a
dentist in town yet, but like,


232
00:09:33.023 --> 00:09:35.153
I could totally hook you up.

233
00:09:35.153 --> 00:09:35.913
Oh.

234
00:09:35.913 --> 00:09:37.733
Um, thanks.

235
00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:38.453
Yeah.

236
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:39.533
I'll let you know.

237
00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:41.513
I've got coupon codes
on there, details


238
00:09:41.513 --> 00:09:44.303
about our super
convenient online portal.


239
00:09:44.303 --> 00:09:47.063
And yeah, I wrote my email
and my celly on the back.


240
00:09:47.063 --> 00:09:48.533
Oh yeah.

241
00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:52.613
chicletsmagnet{jcdentistry.com.

242
00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:55.733
Just don't let him bully you
into a free mouthguard fitting.


243
00:09:55.733 --> 00:09:58.373
Spoiler alert, you still
pay for the mouth guard.


244
00:09:58.373 --> 00:10:00.503
I don't get why
you guys talk shit.


245
00:10:00.503 --> 00:10:01.763
Because you need shit.

246
00:10:01.763 --> 00:10:04.283
Most people charge for
the fitting in addition


247
00:10:04.283 --> 00:10:06.023
to the mouthpiece.

248
00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:08.843
The point is, though, I don't
put pressure on my teammates.


249
00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:10.475
If you want a
mouthpiece, I got a guy.


250
00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:11.183
Just let me know.

251
00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:11.873
Thanks.

252
00:10:11.873 --> 00:10:14.543
I just had my cleaning done,
but I'll try you next time.


253
00:10:14.543 --> 00:10:16.463
Cool, yeah, no pressure at all.

254
00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:18.833
Let me guess, Johnny's
pushing more mouth guards?


255
00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.893
Boys, that online
portal, super convenient.


256
00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:22.943
That's my boy.

257
00:10:22.943 --> 00:10:24.683
Yes sir.

258
00:10:24.683 --> 00:10:25.813
What's up, guys?

259
00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:26.813
Hey, this here is Riley.

260
00:10:26.813 --> 00:10:28.703
He's going to be
subbing for us tonight.


261
00:10:28.703 --> 00:10:29.393
Grayson.

262
00:10:29.393 --> 00:10:30.303
What's up, man?

263
00:10:30.303 --> 00:10:30.843
Yo dude.

264
00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:31.293
Tyler.

265
00:10:31.293 --> 00:10:31.923
How's it going?

266
00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:35.013
Were y'all the guys smoking out
that car in the parking lot?


267
00:10:35.013 --> 00:10:36.326
Dude, I fucking called it.

268
00:10:36.326 --> 00:10:37.743
I told you I wasn't
sketching out.


269
00:10:37.743 --> 00:10:39.463
He was dead ass looking at us.

270
00:10:39.463 --> 00:10:39.963
Oh yeah.

271
00:10:39.963 --> 00:10:41.763
You were so fucking sketched
out, are you kidding me?


272
00:10:41.763 --> 00:10:42.763
Here's your jersey, bud.

273
00:10:42.763 --> 00:10:45.843
Oh, shoot, John,
you even washed it.


274
00:10:45.843 --> 00:10:47.943
Yeah, I hope you like apple pie.

275
00:10:47.943 --> 00:10:50.303
So no Jason tonight?

276
00:10:51.453 --> 00:10:53.283
Dude, no.

277
00:10:53.283 --> 00:10:54.663
Called that shit too.

278
00:10:54.663 --> 00:10:57.343
What's up, fellas?

279
00:10:57.343 --> 00:10:58.233
Hey.

280
00:10:58.233 --> 00:10:59.733
What's up, Sondy.

281
00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:03.993
Just laid the wood on
Smokey Seafood 6-2, dude.


282
00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:05.813
Yeah.

283
00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:08.483
So you score any?

284
00:11:08.483 --> 00:11:10.043
How about a hat trick, huh?

285
00:11:10.043 --> 00:11:10.983
Not so bad.

286
00:11:10.983 --> 00:11:11.723
Yeah.

287
00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:12.413
Good job, bud.

288
00:11:12.413 --> 00:11:13.163
Thank you.

289
00:11:13.163 --> 00:11:15.933
Hat trick and a win.

290
00:11:15.933 --> 00:11:17.593
You going to celebrate?

291
00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.693
Well, some Shoney's
would hit the spot,


292
00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:22.583
but unfortunately it's too
late and they're closed.


293
00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:26.471
Oh, yeah man, too bad.

294
00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:28.513
Probably going to have to
hold off till Thursday,


295
00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:30.643
'cause they're opening
that new Super Shoney's up


296
00:11:30.643 --> 00:11:31.783
in Spartanburg.

297
00:11:31.783 --> 00:11:34.123
Dude, I have been
dying to try one.


298
00:11:34.123 --> 00:11:35.593
What makes it super?

299
00:11:35.593 --> 00:11:37.723
How about an ice cream station.

300
00:11:37.723 --> 00:11:39.013
Wait, did I say a?

301
00:11:39.013 --> 00:11:43.153
I mean two ice cream stations
and a meat carving station.


302
00:11:43.153 --> 00:11:47.383
Also Edwin McCain is
cutting the ribbon.


303
00:11:47.383 --> 00:11:49.033
Wow.

304
00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:50.563
Need I say more, fellas?

305
00:11:50.563 --> 00:11:53.513
That does sound--
that sounds super.


306
00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:54.553
Super lame.

307
00:11:54.553 --> 00:11:55.573
Yeah.

308
00:11:55.573 --> 00:11:59.413
Man, well, safe travels, dude.

309
00:11:59.413 --> 00:12:00.883
I know it's a long drive.

310
00:12:00.883 --> 00:12:04.603
It is far, but it
will be worth it.


311
00:12:04.603 --> 00:12:05.953
If you say so.

312
00:12:05.953 --> 00:12:09.073
So anything else you need?

313
00:12:09.073 --> 00:12:11.653
Oh yeah, sorry, I noticed
you guys were short.


314
00:12:11.653 --> 00:12:13.613
So maybe I should just
bring my stuff in here?


315
00:12:13.613 --> 00:12:14.563
Oh no.

316
00:12:14.563 --> 00:12:15.343
No, no, no.

317
00:12:15.343 --> 00:12:16.963
I think we're all good, dude.

318
00:12:16.963 --> 00:12:19.513
I just, the guys are on the way.

319
00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:23.660
I mean, it's eight minutes
till ice time, dude.


320
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.993
Maybe I could join the pie boys.

321
00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:26.013
I'll just chill.

322
00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:28.263
We appreciate it, man, but
I just texted the guys.


323
00:12:28.263 --> 00:12:28.833
They're in the lot.

324
00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:30.000
They're coming in right now.

325
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.693
So.

326
00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:32.110
All right, bros,
have a good game.


327
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.733
Bring it in.

328
00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:33.903
Polly Pies on one?

329
00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:34.533
No?

330
00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:35.553
Nothing?

331
00:12:35.553 --> 00:12:36.633
All right.

332
00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:39.393
Hey, remember, you're
my best friends.


333
00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:40.593
I love you guys.

334
00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.213
OK.

335
00:12:42.213 --> 00:12:43.743
What the fuck?

336
00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:45.383
Dude sucks.

337
00:12:45.383 --> 00:12:46.283
This fucking guy.

338
00:12:46.283 --> 00:12:47.243
Don't we need the help?

339
00:12:47.243 --> 00:12:49.493
Or does he just suck really bad?

340
00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:50.903
Where to start, man?

341
00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:54.323
He's not, like, bad at hockey.

342
00:12:54.323 --> 00:12:56.843
Dude, he is annoying as fuck.

343
00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:57.773
More annoying than me.

344
00:12:59.063 --> 00:13:00.233
By a little.

345
00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:04.463
And he doesn't fucking
pass, like, ever.


346
00:13:04.463 --> 00:13:07.013
And he talks about Shoney's
all the fucking time.


347
00:13:07.013 --> 00:13:08.243
What is Shoney's?

348
00:13:08.243 --> 00:13:10.913
Oh man, dude.

349
00:13:10.913 --> 00:13:14.033
He would fucking kill
for you to ask him that.


350
00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:16.523
It's basically like a
mediocre buffet place.


351
00:13:16.523 --> 00:13:18.993
It's popular with the
after church crowd.


352
00:13:18.993 --> 00:13:20.753
He's OK with this
being a different food


353
00:13:20.753 --> 00:13:22.273
establishment then?

354
00:13:23.213 --> 00:13:24.383
That's good, man.

355
00:13:24.383 --> 00:13:28.583
Hey, maybe we can use that as
an excuse for the next time.


356
00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.200
Not even funny.

357
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.283
So what's with this place?

358
00:13:31.283 --> 00:13:33.383
Are we sponsored or something?

359
00:13:33.383 --> 00:13:36.723
Proton here thought we might
get some free pie out of it.


360
00:13:36.723 --> 00:13:38.693
Dude, it still might work.

361
00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.683
Polly just said we got
to win the championship.


362
00:13:40.683 --> 00:13:41.903
I mean, it's so doable.

363
00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:42.893
Definitely possible.

364
00:13:42.893 --> 00:13:44.783
All right, well we could
have bought 50 pies


365
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.403
for the cost of these jerseys.

366
00:13:46.403 --> 00:13:50.633
Yeah, but as everyone
knows, dude, free pie just


367
00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:51.893
tastes better.

368
00:13:51.893 --> 00:13:52.943
Right?

369
00:13:52.943 --> 00:13:55.463
Don't you think jerseys were
just committing a little too


370
00:13:55.463 --> 00:13:56.483
much to this bit?

371
00:13:56.483 --> 00:13:58.493
No, I don't.

372
00:13:58.493 --> 00:14:00.143
Dude, Johnny's
just mad we didn't


373
00:14:00.143 --> 00:14:01.583
let him sponsor the team.

374
00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.713
Marketing is tough these days.

375
00:14:03.713 --> 00:14:06.533
If you guys had businesses,
I'd happily support them.


376
00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:10.313
But dude, John Calamino's
Cavity Crunchers?


377
00:14:10.313 --> 00:14:11.783
It's alliteration.

378
00:14:11.783 --> 00:14:14.333
You guys were cool
with Polly's Pies.


379
00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:17.513
Yeah, but we gave you
the shoulder patch.


380
00:14:17.513 --> 00:14:18.143
That's true.

381
00:14:18.143 --> 00:14:18.863
OK.

382
00:14:18.863 --> 00:14:19.793
Really?

383
00:14:19.793 --> 00:14:22.523
Yeah, no one can
fucking read it.


384
00:14:22.523 --> 00:14:24.303
I know that was on purpose.

385
00:14:24.303 --> 00:14:25.523
What?

386
00:14:25.523 --> 00:14:27.683
Dude, come on.

387
00:14:27.683 --> 00:14:29.823
Johnny, why the fuck?

388
00:14:29.823 --> 00:14:31.173
Look at me, John.

389
00:14:31.173 --> 00:14:34.353
Do you think I would do
something like that on purpose?


390
00:14:34.353 --> 00:14:35.133
Seriously though.

391
00:14:40.883 --> 00:14:43.303
Hey man.

392
00:14:43.303 --> 00:14:48.747
I know you're new and all, but
I'm the funny guy on the team.


393
00:14:48.747 --> 00:14:50.593
Huh?

394
00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:51.793
That joke you said in there?

395
00:14:51.793 --> 00:14:54.423
That's something I do.

396
00:14:54.423 --> 00:14:56.613
But dude, don't think
about it too hard.


397
00:14:56.613 --> 00:14:58.093
I've known these
guys for a while.


398
00:14:58.093 --> 00:14:59.635
You'll totally get it.

399
00:14:59.635 --> 00:15:01.793
You dripped some water on
your shirt, by the way.


400
00:15:01.793 --> 00:15:02.543
Boop.

401
00:15:02.543 --> 00:15:03.683
Gotcha, man.

402
00:15:03.683 --> 00:15:05.203
See you out there, bud.

403
00:15:05.203 --> 00:15:05.828
Stupid new guy.

404
00:15:10.773 --> 00:15:12.523
You looking forward
to getting on the ice?


405
00:15:12.523 --> 00:15:13.213
No.

406
00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:14.570
Not at all.

407
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.153
Dude, we got to have
a better attitude


408
00:15:16.153 --> 00:15:17.233
in front of the new guy.

409
00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:19.693
We could just
forfeit and go home.


410
00:15:19.693 --> 00:15:21.593
That does sound nice,
but we're already here.


411
00:15:21.593 --> 00:15:22.353
Yeah, that's true.

412
00:15:22.353 --> 00:15:23.613
Hey, Noely's here.

413
00:15:23.613 --> 00:15:24.363
What's up, baby?

414
00:15:24.363 --> 00:15:25.173
Thank God.

415
00:15:25.173 --> 00:15:26.063
Hurry up, please.

416
00:15:26.063 --> 00:15:27.883
Hey.

417
00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:28.843
Hey, go warm up.

418
00:15:28.843 --> 00:15:29.885
I'll see you in a second.

419
00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:33.751
All right, playboys, stay
hawrt Oh, what's up, boys?


420
00:15:33.751 --> 00:15:35.293
Good thing I'm still
in my gear, huh?


421
00:15:35.293 --> 00:15:36.835
Because according
to my calculations,


422
00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:37.761
you're down a skater.

423
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:38.803
So you want me to hop on?

424
00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:39.523
I'm still loose.

425
00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:41.593
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

426
00:15:41.593 --> 00:15:42.883
Noel just showed up.

427
00:15:42.883 --> 00:15:43.403
That's cool.

428
00:15:43.403 --> 00:15:43.903
Noel's cool.

429
00:15:43.903 --> 00:15:44.443
I love Noel.

430
00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:45.026
You love Noel.

431
00:15:45.026 --> 00:15:46.093
We all love Noel and me.

432
00:15:46.093 --> 00:15:47.893
But earlier Kevin
came up to me and he


433
00:15:47.893 --> 00:15:49.363
was like, "oh my
God, Sondy, you're


434
00:15:49.363 --> 00:15:51.493
the best hockey-- you're like
Connor McSondy or whatever,


435
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:51.973
you know what I mean?

436
00:15:51.973 --> 00:15:53.151
So could you hop on the ice?

437
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:54.193
Because we need the dub."

438
00:15:54.193 --> 00:15:56.318
And I was like, "I guess
I could do that, you know,


439
00:15:56.318 --> 00:15:57.523
because I'd love to."

440
00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:01.393
Dude, as much as I would
like to not play with Kevin,


441
00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:02.453
it's not my call.

442
00:16:02.453 --> 00:16:02.953
I hear you.

443
00:16:02.953 --> 00:16:05.023
I don't have a
letter on my jersey.


444
00:16:05.023 --> 00:16:06.913
You're going to have
to talk to the captain.


445
00:16:06.913 --> 00:16:09.283
Johnny boy here's
got you covered, OK?


446
00:16:09.283 --> 00:16:10.753
I hear you loud and clear.

447
00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:12.373
Yeah, so talk to John.

448
00:16:12.373 --> 00:16:15.403
John, you got it.

449
00:16:15.403 --> 00:16:16.843
Hattie then some natties.

450
00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:18.553
Hey, maybe.

451
00:16:18.553 --> 00:16:19.633
Stay cold.

452
00:16:19.633 --> 00:16:21.388
All right, will do.

453
00:16:21.388 --> 00:16:22.513
What do you think, captain?

454
00:16:22.513 --> 00:16:25.393
You need three goals
in your corner?


455
00:16:25.393 --> 00:16:32.083
As nice as that sounds,
Sondy, um, jersey,


456
00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:33.523
you'd have to wear
a white jersey


457
00:16:33.523 --> 00:16:35.653
or they'd make us forfeit.

458
00:16:35.653 --> 00:16:37.223
I know what you're saying.

459
00:16:37.223 --> 00:16:39.253
You're saying that I
need a white jersey


460
00:16:39.253 --> 00:16:40.663
because you need me.

461
00:16:40.663 --> 00:16:42.133
So you know what?

462
00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:43.543
I will not fail you.

463
00:16:43.543 --> 00:16:47.143
I'm on my way to
get a white jersey.


464
00:16:47.143 --> 00:16:48.833
I'm going to save the game.

465
00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:49.793
Fuck.

466
00:16:49.793 --> 00:16:52.310
Goddamn bunch of jerks.

467
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.143
Keeping me here till
after friggin' midnight


468
00:16:54.143 --> 00:16:58.603
to play goddamn
beer league hockey.


469
00:16:58.603 --> 00:17:00.983
Ooh, I scored a goal
in front of six guys.


470
00:17:00.983 --> 00:17:02.603
Fucking meat head pigeons.

471
00:17:07.442 --> 00:17:08.373
Fuck you looking at?

472
00:17:08.373 --> 00:17:09.273
Nothing.

473
00:17:09.273 --> 00:17:10.503
Yeah, thought so.

474
00:17:10.503 --> 00:17:12.853
Keep roaming, keep moving.

475
00:17:12.853 --> 00:17:13.353
Dickhead.

476
00:17:20.353 --> 00:17:22.873
Dude, ignore that guy, man.

477
00:17:22.873 --> 00:17:23.878
How are you feeling?

478
00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:25.753
Well, my gear is crusty
as hell and my skates


479
00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:27.673
are dull, but other
than that, not too bad.


480
00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:29.303
Hey, that's not so bad.

481
00:17:29.303 --> 00:17:31.873
You just get a little sweating
in you, that'll crust out.


482
00:17:31.873 --> 00:17:32.508
Right.

483
00:17:32.508 --> 00:17:34.633
I just hope the muscle
memory comes back, you know?


484
00:17:34.633 --> 00:17:35.713
Yeah.

485
00:17:35.713 --> 00:17:37.253
I hear it's like riding a bike.

486
00:17:37.253 --> 00:17:40.835
But I never learned how
to ride a bike either.


487
00:17:42.073 --> 00:17:43.933
Oh no.

488
00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:46.403
I didn't know you were
scorekeeping tonight.


489
00:17:46.403 --> 00:17:47.461
Yeah, man.

490
00:17:47.461 --> 00:17:48.253
You want some help?

491
00:17:48.253 --> 00:17:48.883
Yes, please.

492
00:17:48.883 --> 00:17:49.383
I messed up.

493
00:17:49.383 --> 00:17:50.113
All right.

494
00:17:50.113 --> 00:17:51.763
Yeah, thanks.

495
00:17:51.763 --> 00:17:52.453
You're welcome.

496
00:17:52.453 --> 00:17:53.203
How have you been?

497
00:17:53.203 --> 00:17:54.287
I'm good.

498
00:17:54.287 --> 00:17:54.787
You know.

499
00:17:54.787 --> 00:17:56.053
Good.

500
00:17:56.053 --> 00:17:59.441
A nice 11:00 PM
beer league game.


501
00:17:59.441 --> 00:18:00.733
Where else would you rather be?

502
00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:01.993
Oh my God, nowhere.

503
00:18:01.993 --> 00:18:03.083
I know.

504
00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:03.583
Yeah.

505
00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:04.723
Who's the new guy?

506
00:18:04.723 --> 00:18:06.103
Oh, this sweetheart right here?

507
00:18:06.103 --> 00:18:07.093
Oh, this is Riley.

508
00:18:07.093 --> 00:18:08.945
Hey Riley.

509
00:18:08.945 --> 00:18:10.403
Oh my God, Young
Genos are tonight.


510
00:18:10.403 --> 00:18:12.193
Did you guys warn him?

511
00:18:12.193 --> 00:18:13.003
No.

512
00:18:13.003 --> 00:18:15.353
I had to get him in
the building first.


513
00:18:15.353 --> 00:18:15.853
OK.

514
00:18:15.853 --> 00:18:16.813
Nice tactic.

515
00:18:16.813 --> 00:18:18.233
Don't worry about it.

516
00:18:18.233 --> 00:18:18.733
All right.

517
00:18:18.733 --> 00:18:21.113
Just please don't let
them run the score up, OK?


518
00:18:21.113 --> 00:18:22.403
I will do my best.

519
00:18:22.403 --> 00:18:23.033
Yeah, OK.

520
00:18:23.033 --> 00:18:23.995
Look at this, huh?

521
00:18:23.995 --> 00:18:24.953
Sweetheart, am I right?

522
00:18:24.953 --> 00:18:26.183
Yeah, chivalry, man.

523
00:18:26.183 --> 00:18:27.073
I know.

524
00:18:27.073 --> 00:18:28.853
Have fun I guess.

525
00:18:28.853 --> 00:18:30.137
We'll try.

526
00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:34.373
So who are we playing tonight?

527
00:18:34.373 --> 00:18:36.413
The Young Genos.

528
00:18:36.413 --> 00:18:39.263
I mean, are they good?

529
00:18:39.263 --> 00:18:40.583
I mean, they're really good.

530
00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:42.666
They're the whole reason
we have a mercy rule now.


531
00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:44.543
They beat this team 24 to 1.

532
00:18:44.543 --> 00:18:45.233
Holy shit.

533
00:18:45.233 --> 00:18:47.093
Beat their dicks in the dirt.

534
00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:48.383
But don't feel too bad.

535
00:18:48.383 --> 00:18:50.773
I mean, it was Sondy's team.

536
00:18:50.773 --> 00:18:51.621
Great pep talk, man.

537
00:18:51.621 --> 00:18:53.413
I'm about to look like
an asshole out here.


538
00:18:53.413 --> 00:18:56.323
Hey man, we all look
like assholes out here.


539
00:18:56.323 --> 00:18:57.673
You'll be fine, man.

540
00:18:57.673 --> 00:18:59.263
Thanks.

541
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.843
Man, spending your money to play
frigging beer league hockey.


542
00:19:01.843 --> 00:19:02.713
Losers.

543
00:19:02.713 --> 00:19:04.153
Guy thinks he's Rod Brind'Amour.

544
00:19:04.153 --> 00:19:05.693
It's terrible.

545
00:19:05.693 --> 00:19:08.077
I hate this fucking job.

546
00:19:16.383 --> 00:19:18.543
I hate these guys and
all, but for once, I'd


547
00:19:18.543 --> 00:19:20.283
love to warm up
as a goddamn team.


548
00:19:20.283 --> 00:19:22.113
Are they always this intense?

549
00:19:22.113 --> 00:19:23.763
Pretty much.

550
00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:25.653
Make sure you keep
your head up out there.


551
00:19:25.653 --> 00:19:27.883
It can get pretty chippy.

552
00:19:27.883 --> 00:19:30.143
Yeah, I know the type.

553
00:19:30.143 --> 00:19:30.868
Holy shit.

554
00:19:30.868 --> 00:19:31.493
That guy's new.

555
00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:36.773
Do you know him?

556
00:19:36.773 --> 00:19:39.533
No, but fuck he looks good.

557
00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:40.413
That hair.

558
00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:43.823
It's really doing
something for me.


559
00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:49.043
Where the hell are
the rest of the guys?


560
00:19:49.043 --> 00:19:50.183
Fuck.

561
00:19:50.183 --> 00:19:52.943
But like, why was he even
considered a good coach?


562
00:19:52.943 --> 00:19:54.793
What do you mean why?

563
00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:57.173
Homie took a ragtag
district five team


564
00:19:57.173 --> 00:19:58.853
and made them fucking champs.

565
00:19:58.853 --> 00:20:01.493
Dude, it was pee-wees.

566
00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:04.190
So a gold medal in the
Junior Goodwill Games


567
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:05.273
ain't fucking shit either?

568
00:20:05.273 --> 00:20:06.653
Come on, Gray.

569
00:20:06.653 --> 00:20:09.123
Why the fuck should he
get credit for that?


570
00:20:09.123 --> 00:20:11.873
He barely spent any
time with his team.


571
00:20:11.873 --> 00:20:14.153
Charlie fucking Conway
coached that team.


572
00:20:14.153 --> 00:20:15.203
You know it.

573
00:20:15.203 --> 00:20:18.683
And pushing those weak ass
fucking Air Bombay loafers,


574
00:20:18.683 --> 00:20:19.373
dude.

575
00:20:19.373 --> 00:20:20.393
Come on.

576
00:20:20.393 --> 00:20:20.903
OK.

577
00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:24.293
One, those Air Bombay
loafers are fucking fire.


578
00:20:24.293 --> 00:20:26.213
Two, you don't
think that he could


579
00:20:26.213 --> 00:20:27.623
have a fucking social life too?

580
00:20:27.623 --> 00:20:30.113
Those kids had to spend all
day with that tutor lady.


581
00:20:30.113 --> 00:20:32.903
Wait a minute, why were
they even in school?


582
00:20:32.903 --> 00:20:36.053
Wasn't it the summer?

583
00:20:36.053 --> 00:20:37.193
Holy fuck, Noel.

584
00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:43.153
Ah, Young Genos tonight.

585
00:20:43.153 --> 00:20:44.623
Good thing we stretched.

586
00:20:56.083 --> 00:20:58.333
So how's it going?

587
00:20:58.333 --> 00:20:59.473
Oh, not too bad.

588
00:20:59.473 --> 00:21:00.463
Having fun?

589
00:21:00.463 --> 00:21:01.633
Yes, so far.

590
00:21:01.633 --> 00:21:02.293
Uh-huh.

591
00:21:02.293 --> 00:21:04.393
Yeah, convincing.

592
00:21:04.393 --> 00:21:06.463
Well, I tried.

593
00:21:06.463 --> 00:21:08.053
So where are you from?

594
00:21:08.053 --> 00:21:09.283
Around Denver.

595
00:21:09.283 --> 00:21:09.823
Oh nice.

596
00:21:09.823 --> 00:21:10.323
Yeah.

597
00:21:10.323 --> 00:21:11.968
I came out here just
over a year ago.


598
00:21:11.968 --> 00:21:13.093
Were you skating out there?

599
00:21:13.093 --> 00:21:13.783
Yes.

600
00:21:13.783 --> 00:21:15.043
Yeah, a couple times a week.

601
00:21:15.043 --> 00:21:18.163
Why weren't you skating
as soon as you got here?


602
00:21:18.163 --> 00:21:18.823
Partly work.

603
00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:20.113
Partly personal stuff.

604
00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.633
Honestly though, just
finding a whole new team


605
00:21:22.633 --> 00:21:24.283
and meeting new
people, it's just


606
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:26.023
a little overwhelming for me.

607
00:21:26.023 --> 00:21:26.563
Yeah.

608
00:21:26.563 --> 00:21:31.063
I mean, making friends as
a grown ass adult is weird.


609
00:21:31.063 --> 00:21:32.263
Yes, exactly.

610
00:21:32.263 --> 00:21:34.693
I feel like I don't know how
to act in social situations


611
00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:35.201
anymore.

612
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:35.743
I don't know.

613
00:21:35.743 --> 00:21:38.323
I just get all up in my
head about it, I guess.


614
00:21:38.323 --> 00:21:40.813
Well, I mean, these
guys are really nice.


615
00:21:40.813 --> 00:21:42.763
Just don't let
Kevin give you shit.


616
00:21:42.763 --> 00:21:43.583
I'll do my best.

617
00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:44.083
Awesome.

618
00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:46.723
Well, that's my expert advice.

619
00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:48.723
All right, but you'll be fine.

620
00:21:48.723 --> 00:21:50.353
Just have fun.

621
00:21:50.353 --> 00:21:51.193
Thank you.

622
00:21:51.193 --> 00:21:54.113
What's up, bud?

623
00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:55.943
Oh God.

624
00:21:55.943 --> 00:21:58.013
I'm definitely down for
some Wild Wings bro.


625
00:21:58.013 --> 00:21:59.795
Buddy, I'm always up the wing.

626
00:21:59.795 --> 00:22:00.503
Just let me know.

627
00:22:00.503 --> 00:22:02.213
We can get some
pictures or something.


628
00:22:02.213 --> 00:22:02.813
Fucking do it.

629
00:22:02.813 --> 00:22:04.073
Watch some football, bud.

630
00:22:04.073 --> 00:22:05.393
Abso-fucking-lutely.

631
00:22:05.393 --> 00:22:07.043
All right, brother.

632
00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:09.273
What?

633
00:22:09.273 --> 00:22:10.693
You're going to love that guy.

634
00:22:10.693 --> 00:22:12.363
Who is that?

635
00:22:12.363 --> 00:22:13.893
Chet Ennis.

636
00:22:13.893 --> 00:22:15.723
Dude is such a chode.

637
00:22:15.723 --> 00:22:17.343
Must be what that C stands for.

638
00:22:20.593 --> 00:22:22.513
You're just jealous
people think I'm cool.


639
00:22:22.513 --> 00:22:23.083
Yeah?

640
00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:24.673
Is that it?

641
00:22:24.673 --> 00:22:28.183
You mean like your two fucking
brunch buddies over there?


642
00:22:28.183 --> 00:22:29.518
We went to brunch one time.

643
00:22:35.433 --> 00:22:36.787
They're not that bad.

644
00:22:40.213 --> 00:22:40.713
Yeah.

645
00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:55.473
Dude, this fucking sucks.

646
00:22:55.473 --> 00:22:57.433
Let's just get this
shit over with, dude.


647
00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:13.463
Dude, I'm practicing
my freaking heater.


648
00:23:13.463 --> 00:23:14.933
Get the fuck out
of the way, K-dog.


649
00:23:17.818 --> 00:23:18.318
Jesus.

650
00:23:21.893 --> 00:23:24.143
Dude, I said no slapshots.

651
00:23:24.143 --> 00:23:25.923
What the fuck?

652
00:23:25.923 --> 00:23:29.151
Don't bully me in
front of the new guy.


653
00:23:32.343 --> 00:23:35.343
Where is it?

654
00:23:35.343 --> 00:23:36.933
Where is it?

655
00:23:36.933 --> 00:23:41.124
If you're looking for the pizza
Lunchables, I forgot them.


656
00:23:41.124 --> 00:23:43.353
I'm not looking for
the pizza Lunchables.


657
00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:45.783
I'm looking for the
air horn that I know


658
00:23:45.783 --> 00:23:48.213
I packed right before we left.

659
00:23:48.213 --> 00:23:50.163
It is safe.

660
00:23:50.163 --> 00:23:52.353
Can we leave it at that, please?

661
00:23:52.353 --> 00:23:53.253
Yep.

662
00:23:53.253 --> 00:23:54.363
That's fine.

663
00:23:54.363 --> 00:23:55.173
Don't pout.

664
00:23:55.173 --> 00:23:56.283
I'm not pouting.

665
00:23:56.283 --> 00:23:57.933
You're pouting.

666
00:23:57.933 --> 00:23:58.503
Fry.

667
00:23:58.503 --> 00:23:59.193
What?

668
00:23:59.193 --> 00:23:59.773
Look at me.

669
00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:00.273
No.

670
00:24:00.273 --> 00:24:00.993
Look at me.

671
00:24:00.993 --> 00:24:02.133
Nope.

672
00:24:02.133 --> 00:24:02.973
Give me those eyes.

673
00:24:06.253 --> 00:24:09.433
Remember why we're here.

674
00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:11.141
For Kevin.

675
00:24:11.141 --> 00:24:11.641
Because?

676
00:24:14.917 --> 00:24:16.923
Because Kevin's the
coolest guy that we've ever


677
00:24:16.923 --> 00:24:18.298
met in our whole
life and we just


678
00:24:18.298 --> 00:24:20.101
want to be best friends
with him forever.


679
00:24:20.101 --> 00:24:20.643
That's right.

680
00:24:20.643 --> 00:24:24.213
And when he realizes that
we're his best friends, what


681
00:24:24.213 --> 00:24:24.918
happens next?

682
00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:29.203
Well, then we go
brunch crazy, brother.


683
00:24:29.203 --> 00:24:29.703
Yes.

684
00:24:29.703 --> 00:24:30.703
I'm talking shrimp.

685
00:24:30.703 --> 00:24:31.203
Yeah.

686
00:24:31.203 --> 00:24:31.623
Grits.

687
00:24:31.623 --> 00:24:31.953
Yeah.

688
00:24:31.953 --> 00:24:32.553
My-mosas.

689
00:24:32.553 --> 00:24:33.053
Yep.

690
00:24:33.053 --> 00:24:33.683
Benedicts.

691
00:24:33.683 --> 00:24:34.323
Uh-huh.

692
00:24:34.323 --> 00:24:36.153
Maybe even those
little crepey things.


693
00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:38.163
Crepes.

694
00:24:38.163 --> 00:24:39.213
They're crepeys.

695
00:24:39.213 --> 00:24:41.223
Crepeys, yeah.

696
00:24:41.223 --> 00:24:43.798
Cheered me up.

697
00:24:44.673 --> 00:24:46.575
All right, boys.

698
00:24:46.575 --> 00:24:47.658
Can you stop that, please?

699
00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:48.963
Seriously?

700
00:24:48.963 --> 00:24:49.863
It's distracting.

701
00:24:49.863 --> 00:24:51.603
Trying to give a
pre-game speech.


702
00:24:51.603 --> 00:24:52.773
Oh.

703
00:24:52.773 --> 00:24:53.273
Anyway,

704
00:24:54.148 --> 00:24:55.753
this is going to be a tough one.

705
00:24:55.753 --> 00:24:57.983
I want your fucking heads in it.

706
00:24:57.983 --> 00:24:59.305
They start fast.

707
00:24:59.305 --> 00:25:01.013
We're going to have
to weather the storm,


708
00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:02.498
and it will be all right.

709
00:25:04.663 --> 00:25:08.563
Dude, you sound like
some weird stepdad.


710
00:25:08.563 --> 00:25:09.913
Thanks, dad.

711
00:25:09.913 --> 00:25:10.423
Cool.

712
00:25:10.423 --> 00:25:12.163
Fuck me, right?

713
00:25:12.163 --> 00:25:14.203
Just fucking trying to plan.

714
00:25:14.203 --> 00:25:14.833
All right.

715
00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:17.143
Riley, Proton, you guys
are on D. Spell you


716
00:25:17.143 --> 00:25:18.393
when I get the chance.

717
00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:20.663
Rest of us up front.

718
00:25:20.663 --> 00:25:21.373
Let's go, boys.

719
00:25:21.373 --> 00:25:24.473
Let's start on time.

720
00:25:24.473 --> 00:25:26.353
Yeah.

721
00:25:26.353 --> 00:25:29.085
Love the enthusiasm.

722
00:25:36.353 --> 00:25:37.453
Jesus Christ.

723
00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:39.203
We're all waiting for
you at the dot, man.


724
00:25:39.203 --> 00:25:40.763
Let's go.

725
00:25:40.763 --> 00:25:42.143
Warm ups are over?

726
00:25:42.143 --> 00:25:43.873
Yeah.

727
00:25:43.873 --> 00:25:44.373
All right.

728
00:25:44.373 --> 00:25:46.653
Just give me a minute and
I'll be right out there.


729
00:25:46.653 --> 00:25:47.153
OK.

730
00:25:50.174 --> 00:25:50.674
Fuck.

731
00:25:54.133 --> 00:25:55.633
Sup Chet?

732
00:25:55.633 --> 00:25:56.563
Hey man.

733
00:25:56.563 --> 00:25:59.203
See y'all got a
short bench tonight.


734
00:25:59.203 --> 00:26:00.823
Who's the new guy?

735
00:26:00.823 --> 00:26:02.683
Just some guy who hasn't
played in a while.


736
00:26:02.683 --> 00:26:05.263
I'd ask you to take it
easy on us, but you know.


737
00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:08.323
Oh, come on, we won't mercy
you unless you want us to.


738
00:26:08.323 --> 00:26:11.173
We know you old guys need to get
home early and get your sleep.


739
00:26:11.173 --> 00:26:12.223
OK.

740
00:26:12.223 --> 00:26:12.733
Fuck.

741
00:26:12.733 --> 00:26:13.963
And Casey's here?

742
00:26:13.963 --> 00:26:16.840
What, you guys weren't
blowing out people enough?


743
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.673
Saw he came back to
town, had to pick him up


744
00:26:18.673 --> 00:26:19.895
before anyone else could.

745
00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:21.228
Yeah, well that's fucking great.

746
00:26:21.228 --> 00:26:24.763
He wouldn't help out your
old ass team anyways, guy.


747
00:26:24.763 --> 00:26:26.563
Yo, what's up, Casey.

748
00:26:26.563 --> 00:26:27.643
No shit.

749
00:26:27.643 --> 00:26:28.873
What's up, man?

750
00:26:28.873 --> 00:26:29.683
Nothing much.

751
00:26:29.683 --> 00:26:33.333
What are you doing hanging
out with this fucking jabroni?


752
00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:35.710
Yo, so you're on my strong side.

753
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.293
I'm going to win it
right back to you.


754
00:26:37.293 --> 00:26:38.876
If you could flip
it up off the boards


755
00:26:38.876 --> 00:26:41.523
without icing it and keeping
it away from that guy,


756
00:26:41.523 --> 00:26:42.903
it'd be great.

757
00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:43.623
I'll do my best.

758
00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:44.123
All right.

759
00:26:44.123 --> 00:26:46.713
Let's do it, dude.

760
00:26:46.713 --> 00:26:47.213
Fuck.

761
00:26:55.533 --> 00:26:59.223
Out of the way, ya
pair of arseholes.


762
00:26:59.223 --> 00:27:00.183
All right, guys.

763
00:27:00.183 --> 00:27:02.558
Let's get this
stinker over with.


764
00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:03.933
Fucking pecker
heads, we're going


765
00:27:03.933 --> 00:27:05.516
to keep this clean
tonight, all right?


766
00:27:05.516 --> 00:27:06.633
You hear me?

767
00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:10.743
Goalie, goalie.

768
00:27:10.743 --> 00:27:12.063
Nice try, bud.

769
00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:13.923
Get there, Kevin,
get there, Kev.


770
00:27:13.923 --> 00:27:15.003
Casey, Casey.

771
00:27:15.003 --> 00:27:16.293
Get it back.

772
00:27:16.293 --> 00:27:17.943
Oh, he's going wide.

773
00:27:17.943 --> 00:27:19.053
Oh, God damn it.

774
00:27:19.053 --> 00:27:21.524
Somebody cover D. 
Cover D, guys.

775
00:27:21.524 --> 00:27:22.506
Fuck.

776
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:24.673
All right, that's--

777
00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:25.543
Good start, good start.

778
00:27:25.543 --> 00:27:27.943
Not how we wanted to start,
boys, but we'll get it back.


779
00:27:27.943 --> 00:27:29.743
Don't worry.

780
00:27:29.743 --> 00:27:32.413
Hey babe, you picked
a terrible time


781
00:27:32.413 --> 00:27:33.853
to start playing hockey again.

782
00:27:33.853 --> 00:27:34.693
Dude.

783
00:27:34.693 --> 00:27:36.253
Don't worry about it, man.

784
00:27:36.253 --> 00:27:37.961
These guys only play
here because they're


785
00:27:37.961 --> 00:27:39.055
too stupid for college.

786
00:27:39.055 --> 00:27:39.763
There it is, man.

787
00:27:39.763 --> 00:27:40.421
Come on.

788
00:27:40.421 --> 00:27:40.963
Shake it off.

789
00:27:40.963 --> 00:27:42.991
We got it.

790
00:27:43.903 --> 00:27:46.153
Hey, maybe we shouldn't
make big plans this time.


791
00:27:50.593 --> 00:27:52.383
Fuck.

792
00:27:52.383 --> 00:27:54.903
Hey sports fans, you got a
white jersey I could borrow?


793
00:27:54.903 --> 00:27:57.513
John's saying it's got to match
or they'll have to forfeit.


794
00:27:57.513 --> 00:27:58.923
I'm sorry, what was that, Sondy?

795
00:27:58.923 --> 00:28:01.143
I said, do you have a white
jersey I could borrow?


796
00:28:01.143 --> 00:28:02.733
Oh, I wish.

797
00:28:02.733 --> 00:28:05.523
We'd been asking Kevin for
fan jerseys for forever,


798
00:28:05.523 --> 00:28:08.103
but they don't have any.

799
00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:08.803
Shoot.

800
00:28:08.803 --> 00:28:09.903
All right, well thank you.

801
00:28:09.903 --> 00:28:11.643
Of course.

802
00:28:11.643 --> 00:28:14.163
Oh wait, there's a
lost and found hamper


803
00:28:14.163 --> 00:28:15.363
by the skate rental booth.

804
00:28:15.363 --> 00:28:16.238
You should try there.

805
00:28:16.238 --> 00:28:17.163
You might get lucky.

806
00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:18.573
That's where I
found this jacket.


807
00:28:18.573 --> 00:28:19.813
I forgot about that.

808
00:28:19.813 --> 00:28:20.763
Thank you, brother.

809
00:28:20.763 --> 00:28:21.423
Of course.

810
00:28:21.423 --> 00:28:22.383
All right, pie guys.

811
00:28:22.383 --> 00:28:25.303
Hey, y'all still down to go
to Spartanburg on Thursday?


812
00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:28.003
Oh, heck yeah, we want
to go with you, man.


813
00:28:28.003 --> 00:28:29.973
Because word on the
street is first 100 people


814
00:28:29.973 --> 00:28:33.883
get a $25 gift card and a
signed photo from Edwin McCain.


815
00:28:33.883 --> 00:28:34.383
So.

816
00:28:34.383 --> 00:28:37.083
Do you think he's going to play
that one song, the


817
00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:39.243
and I'll be.

818
00:28:39.243 --> 00:28:41.583
If he doesn't, we
will, all right?


819
00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:42.483
Heck yeah.

820
00:28:42.483 --> 00:28:44.658
I will set the building
on fire if he doesn't.


821
00:28:44.658 --> 00:28:45.825
You got my word.

822
00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:47.283
All right, guys,
have a great game.


823
00:28:47.283 --> 00:28:50.295
Bye, Sondy.

824
00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:53.193
Shit, shit, shit.

825
00:28:53.193 --> 00:28:55.383
Aw, get there, get
there, get there.


826
00:28:55.383 --> 00:28:55.953
Fuck yeah.

827
00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:04.273
I mean, I don't know what
the fuck we do either.


828
00:29:04.273 --> 00:29:04.713
All right, boys.

829
00:29:04.713 --> 00:29:06.755
All right, I know we're
down a couple early here,


830
00:29:06.755 --> 00:29:07.953
but let's pot 'em back.

831
00:29:07.953 --> 00:29:08.633
What the fuck?

832
00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:09.883
It's going to be a long night.

833
00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:12.988
You got this, guys.

834
00:29:15.383 --> 00:29:16.343
Not me.

835
00:29:16.343 --> 00:29:17.393
Not me, please.

836
00:29:17.393 --> 00:29:18.713
Oh Jesus.

837
00:29:18.713 --> 00:29:19.733
Oh fuck.

838
00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:21.293
Oh fuck.

839
00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:22.673
Step up, step up.

840
00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:29.733
Yo, yo, yo.

841
00:29:29.733 --> 00:29:32.013
Boys, play responsible out here.

842
00:29:32.013 --> 00:29:33.573
Let's take this seriously.

843
00:29:39.833 --> 00:29:42.233
Hey man.

844
00:29:42.233 --> 00:29:44.273
You have great teeth.

845
00:29:44.273 --> 00:29:45.263
Thanks.

846
00:29:45.263 --> 00:29:47.033
Here, check out my mouthpiece.

847
00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:48.198
Maybe you need one.

848
00:29:48.198 --> 00:29:49.323
Keep it in your mouth, bud.

849
00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:50.453
Oh, well, all right.

850
00:29:50.453 --> 00:29:53.513
Well, you have a
dentist in town yet?


851
00:29:53.513 --> 00:29:55.283
I think I'm all right, man.

852
00:29:55.283 --> 00:29:58.553
Well, if you don't,
man, 25% off.


853
00:29:58.553 --> 00:30:00.323
I got this super
convenient online portal


854
00:30:00.323 --> 00:30:01.133
you can check out.

855
00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:04.313
Call me anytime, 24/7.

856
00:30:04.313 --> 00:30:06.413
Yeah, I'll make sure I
give you a call, man.


857
00:30:06.413 --> 00:30:08.963
You're the kind
of patient I want.


858
00:30:08.963 --> 00:30:12.833
Great, great moves out
there, and man, that flow.


859
00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:16.433
How do you think that hair
would look on a dentist?


860
00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:17.663
Cover point, cover point.

861
00:30:17.663 --> 00:30:19.493
Kevin, get your guy.

862
00:30:19.493 --> 00:30:20.843
Shit, shit, shit.

863
00:30:20.843 --> 00:30:22.673
Left side, left side.

864
00:30:22.673 --> 00:30:24.305
Get it out, guys.

865
00:30:24.305 --> 00:30:26.063
Left point.

866
00:30:26.063 --> 00:30:29.623
Someone cover back.

867
00:30:29.623 --> 00:30:32.360
Back of the net.

868
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.193
In front of the net.

869
00:30:36.078 --> 00:30:37.778
Left side, left side.

870
00:30:37.778 --> 00:30:38.278
Front.

871
00:30:38.278 --> 00:30:41.113
Watch the front.

872
00:30:41.113 --> 00:30:41.613
Yeah.

873
00:30:41.613 --> 00:30:42.363
Got a floater.

874
00:30:42.363 --> 00:30:43.393
Watch him, watch him.

875
00:30:43.393 --> 00:30:45.603
Apple, what are you doing?

876
00:30:45.603 --> 00:30:47.603
Tie him up.

877
00:30:47.603 --> 00:30:49.553
Nick, Nick, huge save, buddy.

878
00:30:49.553 --> 00:30:50.813
Good one.

879
00:30:50.813 --> 00:30:52.619
Loose, loose, loose.

880
00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:54.068
Help him out.

881
00:30:57.453 --> 00:30:58.185
Shot.

882
00:30:58.185 --> 00:30:59.631
Nicky Noodle with the save!

883
00:31:03.013 --> 00:31:08.713
Dude, this one time in pee-wees,
I was grounded for some reason.


884
00:31:08.713 --> 00:31:09.973
I don't remember why.

885
00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:12.643
Probably
something stupid.


886
00:31:12.643 --> 00:31:14.723
You can ask my dad later.

887
00:31:14.723 --> 00:31:17.623
But he said if I
scored a hat trick,


888
00:31:17.623 --> 00:31:20.863
I would totally be ungrounded.

889
00:31:20.863 --> 00:31:23.823
You know what happened?

890
00:31:23.823 --> 00:31:27.213
I totally went back
to back to back--


891
00:31:27.213 --> 00:31:29.173
natty hattie.

892
00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:31.033
And I was ungrounded
the next day.


893
00:31:34.073 --> 00:31:36.063
Cool.

894
00:31:36.063 --> 00:31:39.063
Sorry, is there a reason
you're telling me this?


895
00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:40.713
I thought it might pump you up.

896
00:31:40.713 --> 00:31:42.063
Give you some motivation.

897
00:31:42.063 --> 00:31:44.703
Kevin, get on the fucking ice.

898
00:31:44.703 --> 00:31:45.778
Come on, let's go.

899
00:31:45.778 --> 00:31:46.653
I'm going, I'm going.

900
00:31:46.653 --> 00:31:49.293
Fucking shit, dude.

901
00:31:49.293 --> 00:31:50.343
You can do it too, man.

902
00:31:50.343 --> 00:31:51.138
Go ask my dad.

903
00:31:56.033 --> 00:31:56.638
Let me guess.

904
00:31:56.638 --> 00:31:58.253
He told you the hat trick story.

905
00:31:58.253 --> 00:31:59.513
Yeah.

906
00:31:59.513 --> 00:32:01.103
Is he for real?

907
00:32:01.103 --> 00:32:02.833
Dude, he thinks so.

908
00:32:02.833 --> 00:32:04.583
See, I don't think
he's scored three goals


909
00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:07.478
in his whole fucking
life, honestly.


910
00:32:19.947 --> 00:32:22.407
Come on, boys.

911
00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:24.867
Tyler, come on.

912
00:32:24.867 --> 00:32:27.343
Walk it out.

913
00:32:27.343 --> 00:32:29.293
Pass it up, pass it up.

914
00:32:29.293 --> 00:32:30.043
Come on, guys.

915
00:32:32.953 --> 00:32:34.853
Don't play fucking
tennis with the puck.


916
00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:35.353
Oh!

917
00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:39.733
Good shit, man Riley, let's go.

918
00:32:44.243 --> 00:32:47.053
Get it the fuck out of here.

919
00:32:47.053 --> 00:32:49.153
Clear out the trash, guys.

920
00:32:49.153 --> 00:32:52.723
Somebody ice the fucking puck.

921
00:32:52.723 --> 00:32:55.293
Great shot.

922
00:32:55.293 --> 00:32:56.473
That was dirty, brother.

923
00:32:56.473 --> 00:32:58.833
Nice fucking save, Nick.

924
00:32:58.833 --> 00:33:00.243
Sorry I don't back check, man.

925
00:33:00.243 --> 00:33:01.973
I'm tired.

926
00:33:01.973 --> 00:33:04.123
Fuck.

927
00:33:04.123 --> 00:33:08.143
I hate to leave the new guy
hanging, but I'm exhausted.


928
00:33:08.143 --> 00:33:09.868
I fucking hate
playing these guys.


929
00:33:09.868 --> 00:33:11.743
I'm just so sick of them
throwing the fucking


930
00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:13.483
body around like they're
about to get a call up.


931
00:33:13.483 --> 00:33:14.233
Yeah.

932
00:33:14.233 --> 00:33:17.263
I don't think they understand
the recreational part of this.


933
00:33:17.263 --> 00:33:18.013
No.

934
00:33:18.013 --> 00:33:20.323
And they pull this trash
all game and the refs


935
00:33:20.323 --> 00:33:23.023
wonder why it boils over in
the third every single time.


936
00:33:23.023 --> 00:33:24.293
Every time.

937
00:33:24.293 --> 00:33:25.813
But don't get kicked out.

938
00:33:25.813 --> 00:33:27.303
Two on the bench is bad enough.

939
00:33:27.303 --> 00:33:27.823
I'll try.

940
00:33:27.823 --> 00:33:30.443
Three hat tricks in one night,
you'll be in the papers.


941
00:33:30.443 --> 00:33:32.113
Oh God.

942
00:33:32.113 --> 00:33:33.253
Hey boys.

943
00:33:33.253 --> 00:33:34.633
I found the white jersey.

944
00:33:34.633 --> 00:33:37.003
Probably want me on the
ice immediately, huh?


945
00:33:37.003 --> 00:33:39.553
Hey Sondy, I don't
think you can, man.


946
00:33:39.553 --> 00:33:41.173
The game's already started.

947
00:33:41.173 --> 00:33:43.483
I mean, it's a
sick jersey though.


948
00:33:43.483 --> 00:33:44.053
Thank you.

949
00:33:44.053 --> 00:33:46.123
I stole it out of
some dumb kid's bag.


950
00:33:46.123 --> 00:33:48.463
Are you sure we
can't just ask Erin?


951
00:33:48.463 --> 00:33:50.563
We can.

952
00:33:50.563 --> 00:33:51.343
OK.

953
00:33:51.343 --> 00:33:52.543
Hey Erin.

954
00:33:52.543 --> 00:33:54.343
Hey Erin.

955
00:33:54.343 --> 00:33:55.483
Erin.

956
00:33:55.483 --> 00:34:00.163
Hey, Sondy wants to hop on
for us, but he can't, right?


957
00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:02.293
The game started.

958
00:34:02.293 --> 00:34:03.733
Yeah.

959
00:34:03.733 --> 00:34:06.313
The score sheet's locked in.

960
00:34:06.313 --> 00:34:08.983
I can't add to it
once the game starts.


961
00:34:08.983 --> 00:34:09.763
Are you sure?

962
00:34:09.763 --> 00:34:11.832
I mean I saw somebody
from the Flying Soldiers


963
00:34:11.832 --> 00:34:13.602
did it last game.

964
00:34:13.602 --> 00:34:16.002
Yeah, I know, but
if I do something,


965
00:34:16.002 --> 00:34:17.863
then the other team's
going to just, like,


966
00:34:17.863 --> 00:34:20.893
possibly dispute the outcome
because of an illegal player.


967
00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:22.813
I guess it's just
their policy, Sondy.


968
00:34:22.813 --> 00:34:24.673
You know we'd love
to have you, man.


969
00:34:24.673 --> 00:34:26.580
That really is a
bummer for you, not me.


970
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.663
Because I'm going to go
eat an egg salad sandwich.


971
00:34:28.663 --> 00:34:29.868
But good luck without me.

972
00:34:29.868 --> 00:34:30.493
You'll need it.

973
00:34:30.493 --> 00:34:32.263
I love you guys.

974
00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:32.803
Oh my God.

975
00:34:32.803 --> 00:34:33.493
Close one.

976
00:34:33.493 --> 00:34:34.123
Jesus.

977
00:34:34.123 --> 00:34:35.022
What a mutant.

978
00:34:38.213 --> 00:34:38.713
Jeez.

979
00:34:38.713 --> 00:34:41.443
Another fucking hole?

980
00:34:41.443 --> 00:34:43.423
Mark, Mark, yo Mark, come here.

981
00:34:43.423 --> 00:34:45.102
Oh Jesus, Murphy.

982
00:34:45.102 --> 00:34:47.263
Yeah?

983
00:34:47.263 --> 00:34:48.283
Can we get that fixed?

984
00:34:48.283 --> 00:34:50.283
I don't want to blow out another
fucking knee in this place.


985
00:34:50.283 --> 00:34:51.153
Yeah.

986
00:34:51.153 --> 00:34:52.233
You got a water bottle?

987
00:34:52.233 --> 00:34:53.431
Yeah.

988
00:34:53.431 --> 00:34:53.973
There you go.

989
00:34:53.973 --> 00:34:54.783
Take care of this.

990
00:35:01.823 --> 00:35:03.833
Jesus, the fucking water
ball doesn't even work.


991
00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:05.213
Does anything work around here?

992
00:35:05.213 --> 00:35:05.921
John bought them.

993
00:35:05.921 --> 00:35:07.623
Can you expect anything else?

994
00:35:07.623 --> 00:35:10.223
Would be nice if someone could
cut the fucking ice around here


995
00:35:10.223 --> 00:35:10.853
sometimes.

996
00:35:10.853 --> 00:35:11.798
Jesus Christ.

997
00:35:14.313 --> 00:35:15.801
The fuck you say?

998
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:16.593
Have you seen this?

999
00:35:16.593 --> 00:35:17.750
It's a fucking joke.

1000
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.833
Bud, they pay me to put a
layer down, not redo it.


1001
00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:21.603
Don't put the shit on me.

1002
00:35:21.603 --> 00:35:22.698
He's got the point.

1003
00:35:23.733 --> 00:35:25.083
Guys, get the puck out.

1004
00:35:25.083 --> 00:35:26.673
Come on.

1005
00:35:26.673 --> 00:35:27.273
I got high.

1006
00:35:27.273 --> 00:35:28.423
I got high.

1007
00:35:29.783 --> 00:35:32.613
Come on, Noel, you're
better than him.


1008
00:35:32.613 --> 00:35:35.913
Come on, Noel, put it by him.

1009
00:35:37.193 --> 00:35:39.063
Oh, that's BS.

1010
00:35:39.063 --> 00:35:40.638
5 White trip!

1011
00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:41.763
Suck my dick from the back.

1012
00:35:41.763 --> 00:35:42.430
Fuck you, buddy.

1013
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:43.473
I bet you'd like that.

1014
00:35:43.473 --> 00:35:45.363
I fucking would.

1015
00:35:45.363 --> 00:35:49.023
Kick his friggin' ass, Noel.

1016
00:35:49.023 --> 00:35:52.593
Mark, Mark, can I sub
in the P box for Noel?


1017
00:35:52.593 --> 00:35:53.553
Would you piss off?

1018
00:35:53.553 --> 00:35:55.773
You know everybody has to
serve their own penalties.


1019
00:35:55.773 --> 00:35:57.183
But I'm tired.

1020
00:35:57.183 --> 00:35:58.983
Holy-- fuck off you jackwagon.

1021
00:35:58.983 --> 00:36:01.973
Can we play fours at least?

1022
00:36:01.973 --> 00:36:03.473
Come on.

1023
00:36:03.473 --> 00:36:04.151
Fuck you, buddy.

1024
00:36:04.151 --> 00:36:05.693
You couldn't pour
water out of a boot


1025
00:36:05.693 --> 00:36:07.336
if the directions
were on the heel.


1026
00:36:07.336 --> 00:36:08.753
Everybody fucking
hates you, Chet.


1027
00:36:08.753 --> 00:36:09.378
You're a loser.

1028
00:36:09.378 --> 00:36:10.713
It is what it is.

1029
00:36:10.713 --> 00:36:12.173
Look who's losing right now.

1030
00:36:12.173 --> 00:36:13.733
Wait till I get out.

1031
00:36:13.733 --> 00:36:15.170
Let me see you do something.

1032
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.878
What's up, cutie?

1033
00:36:20.673 --> 00:36:22.723
I got five white with a trip.

1034
00:36:22.723 --> 00:36:23.223
Christ.

1035
00:36:27.373 --> 00:36:28.423
Sorry, boys.

1036
00:36:28.423 --> 00:36:30.571
It's all good, Noel.

1037
00:36:37.235 --> 00:36:40.223
You doing Bumble?

1038
00:36:40.223 --> 00:36:40.723
Yeah.

1039
00:36:40.723 --> 00:36:42.673
Any luck?

1040
00:36:42.673 --> 00:36:45.793
Yeah, this lady Padgett just
matched me before we got here.


1041
00:36:45.793 --> 00:36:50.113
She hasn't said anything
yet, but she is good looking.


1042
00:36:50.113 --> 00:36:51.763
Should I tell her that?

1043
00:36:51.763 --> 00:36:52.723
What?

1044
00:36:52.723 --> 00:36:54.823
No, don't tell her that.

1045
00:36:54.823 --> 00:36:55.993
That's gross.

1046
00:36:55.993 --> 00:36:57.923
You got to lie.

1047
00:36:57.923 --> 00:36:59.893
I don't know if I feel
comfortable doing--


1048
00:36:59.893 --> 00:37:01.333
that's just being fake, right?

1049
00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:02.833
Yeah, it's being fake.

1050
00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:04.933
You just got back
in the dating scene.


1051
00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:08.683
I mean, these apps, it's a
complete game changer, man.


1052
00:37:08.683 --> 00:37:10.363
I guess you're right.

1053
00:37:10.363 --> 00:37:12.313
Do you think I'm
ready for that though?


1054
00:37:12.313 --> 00:37:13.513
You don't have to be ready.

1055
00:37:13.513 --> 00:37:15.463
You got the expert
sitting right next to you.


1056
00:37:15.463 --> 00:37:16.633
Me.

1057
00:37:16.633 --> 00:37:19.333
Well, I'm excited to go
to Shoney's next week.


1058
00:37:19.333 --> 00:37:20.958
I wish we didn't have
to go with Sondy.


1059
00:37:20.958 --> 00:37:21.458
What?

1060
00:37:21.458 --> 00:37:22.003
Why?

1061
00:37:22.003 --> 00:37:23.173
I think I was pretty clear.

1062
00:37:23.173 --> 00:37:24.413
He freaks me out.

1063
00:37:24.413 --> 00:37:25.873
I don't want him
in our entourage.


1064
00:37:25.873 --> 00:37:27.473
He's trying to
steal you from me.


1065
00:37:27.473 --> 00:37:29.923
No one could steal
me from you, OK?


1066
00:37:29.923 --> 00:37:30.423
OK.

1067
00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:35.563
Come on, boys.

1068
00:37:35.563 --> 00:37:37.153
I'm in the clear.

1069
00:37:37.153 --> 00:37:38.563
Come on, help him out.

1070
00:37:38.563 --> 00:37:40.033
Get it out.

1071
00:37:40.033 --> 00:37:40.783
Clear it.

1072
00:37:40.783 --> 00:37:41.623
Oh shit.

1073
00:37:41.623 --> 00:37:43.343
Let's go, Nick.

1074
00:37:43.343 --> 00:37:43.843
Atta boy.

1075
00:37:43.843 --> 00:37:44.343
Atta boy.

1076
00:37:47.243 --> 00:37:48.083
Get the fuck out.

1077
00:37:48.083 --> 00:37:48.863
Cover, cover.

1078
00:37:48.863 --> 00:37:49.913
Nice save, nice save.

1079
00:37:49.913 --> 00:37:51.683
Right side, right side.

1080
00:37:51.683 --> 00:37:52.475
Man up.

1081
00:37:52.475 --> 00:37:54.323
Man up.

1082
00:37:54.323 --> 00:37:57.363
Get the fuck off me.

1083
00:37:57.363 --> 00:38:01.403
You got five seconds.

1084
00:38:01.403 --> 00:38:01.943
Yo, Casey!

1085
00:38:01.943 --> 00:38:02.443
Casey!

1086
00:38:05.873 --> 00:38:07.343
Got Noel coming out.

1087
00:38:07.343 --> 00:38:10.133
Yeah, Nick.

1088
00:38:10.133 --> 00:38:11.573
Holy fuck that sauce!

1089
00:38:14.453 --> 00:38:15.423
Woo!

1090
00:38:15.423 --> 00:38:16.443
Let's go, Noel.

1091
00:38:16.443 --> 00:38:18.183
Let's go, baby.

1092
00:38:18.183 --> 00:38:21.613
Fuck yeah, bud.

1093
00:38:33.113 --> 00:38:34.113
Woo.

1094
00:38:34.113 --> 00:38:35.733
Yeah, let's go.

1095
00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:36.604
Yeah.

1096
00:38:36.604 --> 00:38:37.104
Woo.

1097
00:38:40.728 --> 00:38:41.853
I think I was pretty clear.

1098
00:38:41.853 --> 00:38:44.313
He freaks me out.

1099
00:38:44.313 --> 00:38:46.458
Have you seen him?

1100
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:49.493
I don't want him
in our entourage.


1101
00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.343
Hey, Hubee, what's up?

1102
00:38:51.343 --> 00:38:52.483
What is up, Sondy?

1103
00:38:52.483 --> 00:38:53.123
How are you?

1104
00:38:53.123 --> 00:38:54.013
What's up, Sondy.

1105
00:38:54.013 --> 00:38:55.993
We saw you walking
around the boards.


1106
00:38:55.993 --> 00:38:58.143
That jersey was too small?

1107
00:38:58.143 --> 00:38:59.933
No.

1108
00:38:59.933 --> 00:39:01.643
It looked pretty small.

1109
00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:04.673
The hell would you know about
anything at all about hockey?


1110
00:39:04.673 --> 00:39:06.243
I am a hat trick man.

1111
00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:06.743
OK?

1112
00:39:06.743 --> 00:39:07.973
That's why I wear
the tight Jersey.


1113
00:39:07.973 --> 00:39:08.843
It makes me fast.

1114
00:39:08.843 --> 00:39:10.643
Laws of speed.

1115
00:39:10.643 --> 00:39:11.933
That is true, Fry.

1116
00:39:11.933 --> 00:39:13.863
You don't play hockey.

1117
00:39:13.863 --> 00:39:14.363
But--

1118
00:39:14.363 --> 00:39:16.073
Like what did happen?

1119
00:39:16.073 --> 00:39:17.413
Some red tape bullshit, dude.

1120
00:39:17.413 --> 00:39:19.913
They were saying something about
me being an illegal player.


1121
00:39:19.913 --> 00:39:21.353
I think they hate the flag.

1122
00:39:21.353 --> 00:39:22.373
That's typical, man.

1123
00:39:22.373 --> 00:39:23.013
I'm sorry.

1124
00:39:23.013 --> 00:39:23.513
I know.

1125
00:39:23.513 --> 00:39:24.445
Socialist nonsense.

1126
00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:26.153
They could have really
used me today too.


1127
00:39:26.153 --> 00:39:26.843
They could have.

1128
00:39:26.843 --> 00:39:28.853
We saw you got a hat
trick earlier today.


1129
00:39:28.853 --> 00:39:30.143
Hatty daddy over here.

1130
00:39:30.143 --> 00:39:30.893
You saw that?

1131
00:39:30.893 --> 00:39:31.763
Sure did.

1132
00:39:31.763 --> 00:39:34.073
Yeah, we stay on the
website, so we saw it.


1133
00:39:34.073 --> 00:39:37.963
So you saw how sweet I am?

1134
00:39:37.963 --> 00:39:39.913
Yeah, pretty sweet.

1135
00:39:39.913 --> 00:39:41.503
Well, so, what do
you got going on


1136
00:39:41.503 --> 00:39:42.493
in the rest of the night, man?

1137
00:39:42.493 --> 00:39:43.701
You just getting out of here?

1138
00:39:43.701 --> 00:39:44.893
No, I got to run to my car.

1139
00:39:44.893 --> 00:39:47.773
I got an egg salad sandwich
in there that I need to eat


1140
00:39:47.773 --> 00:39:48.688
or, you know.

1141
00:39:48.688 --> 00:39:50.563
That does sound
good, but you know


1142
00:39:50.563 --> 00:39:52.633
you're more than welcome to join
us for the rest of the game.


1143
00:39:52.633 --> 00:39:54.193
I even think we're going
to Waffle House with Kevin


1144
00:39:54.193 --> 00:39:55.063
afterwards.

1145
00:39:55.063 --> 00:39:56.983
I know it's no Shoney's, but.

1146
00:39:56.983 --> 00:40:00.103
Wait, you want to go
somewhere else with me


1147
00:40:00.103 --> 00:40:02.863
that's not here together?

1148
00:40:02.863 --> 00:40:03.973
Yeah, of course, man.

1149
00:40:03.973 --> 00:40:05.353
That's awesome.

1150
00:40:05.353 --> 00:40:07.123
Dude, I got a fruit
punch in my car.


1151
00:40:07.123 --> 00:40:08.173
I will be right back.

1152
00:40:08.173 --> 00:40:08.893
Hey, fruit punch.

1153
00:40:08.893 --> 00:40:09.523
We love fruit punch.

1154
00:40:09.523 --> 00:40:10.398
Do you have any more?

1155
00:40:10.398 --> 00:40:13.843
I don't have any more.

1156
00:40:13.843 --> 00:40:15.013
I'll see you guys there.

1157
00:40:15.013 --> 00:40:16.573
All right, Sondy.

1158
00:40:16.573 --> 00:40:18.853
You know where to find us, man.

1159
00:40:18.853 --> 00:40:20.063
What are you doing?

1160
00:40:20.063 --> 00:40:20.563
What?

1161
00:40:20.563 --> 00:40:21.733
I invited him to the game.

1162
00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:22.853
Why would you invite him?

1163
00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.103
You said we need more friends.

1164
00:40:24.103 --> 00:40:25.091
Me, you, Kevin.

1165
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:26.383
That's all the friends we need.

1166
00:40:26.383 --> 00:40:29.863
You're going to have us go to
a second location with Sondy?


1167
00:40:29.863 --> 00:40:30.673
That Sondy?

1168
00:40:30.673 --> 00:40:32.233
It's the Waffle House.

1169
00:40:32.233 --> 00:40:33.613
You love Waffle House.

1170
00:40:33.613 --> 00:40:35.813
We're going to end
up in his trunk.


1171
00:40:35.813 --> 00:40:36.313
What?

1172
00:40:36.313 --> 00:40:38.533
No, we can ride
in the back seat.


1173
00:40:38.533 --> 00:40:41.193
I have work tomorrow.

1174
00:40:41.193 --> 00:40:43.613
I'll write you a doctor's note.

1175
00:40:43.613 --> 00:40:45.423
Would that be legit?

1176
00:40:45.423 --> 00:40:47.493
Of course.

1177
00:40:47.493 --> 00:40:49.233
Solid period, boys.

1178
00:40:49.233 --> 00:40:51.353
All right, guys.

1179
00:40:51.353 --> 00:40:53.813
Nick was really bailing
our asses out though.


1180
00:40:53.813 --> 00:40:56.093
This should be a
blowout right now.


1181
00:40:56.093 --> 00:40:58.973
We got to play smarter.

1182
00:40:58.973 --> 00:41:01.103
Thanks, dad.

1183
00:41:01.103 --> 00:41:02.993
Riley, I know it
was a rough start.


1184
00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:05.303
I really appreciate
you not quitting on us.


1185
00:41:05.303 --> 00:41:07.143
Looks like you're
starting to settle in.


1186
00:41:07.143 --> 00:41:08.473
It doesn't feel like it.

1187
00:41:08.473 --> 00:41:09.601
Nah, dude, fuck that.

1188
00:41:09.601 --> 00:41:11.393
It's just a tough time
to get started, bud.


1189
00:41:11.393 --> 00:41:12.323
You're fine.

1190
00:41:12.323 --> 00:41:12.863
You're good.

1191
00:41:16.723 --> 00:41:19.505
Love you, Nick.

1192
00:41:43.907 --> 00:41:46.196
Fuck you, buddy.

1193
00:41:46.196 --> 00:41:47.363
Get your nuts off my goalie.

1194
00:41:47.363 --> 00:41:48.988
What the fuck are
you guys going to do?


1195
00:41:48.988 --> 00:41:51.539
Show some freaking class.

1196
00:41:58.303 --> 00:41:59.863
Hey Erin, it's pulled up.

1197
00:41:59.863 --> 00:42:02.503
Would you mind just plugging
it in and hitting play?


1198
00:42:02.503 --> 00:42:03.328
Thank you so much.

1199
00:42:07.143 --> 00:42:08.843
Yeah, what is this?

1200
00:42:08.843 --> 00:42:10.373
something cool.

1201
00:42:10.373 --> 00:42:11.033
Is it?

1202
00:42:11.033 --> 00:42:11.533
All right.

1203
00:42:11.533 --> 00:42:13.733
I'm going to sell
some mouthpieces.


1204
00:42:13.733 --> 00:42:14.829

Fuck.

Fuck, it's still going.

Erin, turn it off.

1235
00:43:22.873 --> 00:43:24.223
I don't know-- I don't know
what you want me to do.


1236
00:43:24.223 --> 00:43:25.293
I can't get it to stop.

1237
00:43:25.293 --> 00:43:25.863

00:43:38.223 --> 00:43:38.733
Thank you.

1244
00:43:38.733 --> 00:43:40.098
I don't know.

1245
00:43:41.583 --> 00:43:42.363
Fucking asshole.

1246
00:43:42.363 --> 00:43:42.993
What?

1247
00:43:42.993 --> 00:43:44.863
I was trying to move.

1248
00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:48.813
That was more exhausting
than the game.


1249
00:43:48.813 --> 00:43:50.193
What?

1250
00:43:50.193 --> 00:43:51.228

So sorry.

1254

Oh.

1255
00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.643
Wait, wait, get it out.

1256
00:44:07.643 --> 00:44:09.071
Get it out.

1257
00:44:09.071 --> 00:44:10.507
Throw it up.

1258
00:44:10.507 --> 00:44:11.007
Throw it up!

1259
00:44:11.007 --> 00:44:11.921
Watch on top.

1260
00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:12.463

Come on, you guys.

1262
00:44:18.113 --> 00:44:19.043
Backdoor, backdoor.

1263
00:44:21.673 --> 00:44:23.527
Get it out.

1264
00:44:27.963 --> 00:44:29.393
Come on, Apple.

1265
00:44:29.393 --> 00:44:31.139
Come on.

1266
00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:35.486
Can't get by one on
this guy tonight.


1267
00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:36.452
Ridiculous.

1268
00:44:39.363 --> 00:44:40.600
So I'm sucking at D now.

1269
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.183
Can you switch with
me for this shift?


1270
00:44:42.183 --> 00:44:42.963
Yeah, of course.

1271
00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:44.223
OK, I'm going to
win it back to you


1272
00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:46.306
and go left if you want
to push it off the boards.


1273
00:44:46.306 --> 00:44:48.581
Hell yeah, sounds great.

1274
00:45:11.213 --> 00:45:12.433
Let's go, boys.

1275
00:45:12.433 --> 00:45:14.313
Let's go.

1276
00:45:14.313 --> 00:45:15.503
Let's do this.

1277
00:45:15.503 --> 00:45:16.103
Uh.

1278
00:45:16.103 --> 00:45:16.603
Yeah.

1279
00:45:16.603 --> 00:45:18.313
Yes.

1280
00:45:18.313 --> 00:45:19.228
Fucking A, boys.

1281
00:45:23.403 --> 00:45:24.063
Got one.

1282
00:45:24.063 --> 00:45:26.005
Good shift, buddy.

1283
00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:27.213
Looking good out there, boys.

1284
00:45:27.213 --> 00:45:28.231
Legs are active.

1285
00:45:28.231 --> 00:45:29.523
The fuck are you talking about?

1286
00:45:29.523 --> 00:45:31.351
We should be blowing
these fuckers out.


1287
00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:32.643
It's fucking beer league, Chet.

1288
00:45:32.643 --> 00:45:33.483
Relax, bud.

1289
00:45:33.483 --> 00:45:35.553
Dude, what the fuck are
you talking about, bro?


1290
00:45:35.553 --> 00:45:37.143
You should be
roasting these guys.


1291
00:45:37.713 --> 00:45:40.383
Does that C on your Jersey
stand for Chet or Coach?


1292
00:45:40.383 --> 00:45:41.625
Stands for fucking captain.

1293
00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:42.333
I brought you in.

1294
00:45:42.333 --> 00:45:44.673
I gave you a jersey with your
last name, so let's see it.


1295
00:45:44.673 --> 00:45:46.256
All right, show me
how to do it, Chet.


1296
00:45:46.256 --> 00:45:47.673
I fucking will.

1297
00:45:47.673 --> 00:45:50.363
Hey, Shoobs, get the
fuck off the ice.


1298
00:45:50.363 --> 00:45:53.513
Galley, quit with
the fancy shit.


1299
00:45:53.513 --> 00:45:55.985
Give me the fucking puck.

1300
00:46:06.153 --> 00:46:07.503
There you go, Nick.

1301
00:46:07.503 --> 00:46:09.285
No way.

1302
00:46:11.655 --> 00:46:16.283
Watch in front of the net, boys!

1303
00:46:16.283 --> 00:46:17.133
Pick 'em up.

1304
00:46:17.133 --> 00:46:19.063
Good shit, Nick.

1305
00:46:19.063 --> 00:46:20.473
Hey, fuck you.

1306
00:46:20.473 --> 00:46:21.887
Fuck you going to do, huh?

1307
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.518
Kick it out, you bitch.

1308
00:46:29.518 --> 00:46:32.761
What the hell, man?

1309
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:33.473
Ow.

1310
00:46:33.473 --> 00:46:35.243
Fucking pussy.

1311
00:46:35.243 --> 00:46:37.673
Yo, what the fuck, dude?

1312
00:46:37.673 --> 00:46:38.993
Justice.

1313
00:46:38.993 --> 00:46:41.223
61 white, rough.

1314
00:46:41.223 --> 00:46:43.556
Eat a dick, Mark.

1315
00:46:43.556 --> 00:46:44.848
That's what friendship's about.

1316
00:46:44.848 --> 00:46:46.233
Get the fuck off me, I'm good.

1317
00:46:49.283 --> 00:46:51.863
Fucking refs and their
bullshit calls, man.


1318
00:46:51.863 --> 00:46:54.413
It's not even fucking
worth playing.


1319
00:46:54.413 --> 00:46:55.373
God.

1320
00:46:55.373 --> 00:46:56.993
You good?

1321
00:46:56.993 --> 00:46:59.543
Johnny, these fucking
water bottles too?


1322
00:46:59.543 --> 00:47:00.623
God.

1323
00:47:00.623 --> 00:47:02.813
I just, I can't
stand fucking Chet.


1324
00:47:02.813 --> 00:47:03.773
Don't worry about it.

1325
00:47:03.773 --> 00:47:05.753
You're giving him
exactly what he wants.


1326
00:47:05.753 --> 00:47:06.563
You're right.

1327
00:47:06.563 --> 00:47:07.253
You're right.

1328
00:47:07.253 --> 00:47:12.503
I mean, just try to calm
down for fucking two minutes.


1329
00:47:12.503 --> 00:47:15.683
Nope, nope, nope.

1330
00:47:59.333 --> 00:48:02.133
Oh, she messaged me.

1331
00:48:02.133 --> 00:48:03.713
Look, she actually messaged me.

1332
00:48:03.713 --> 00:48:04.253
Oh yeah?

1333
00:48:04.253 --> 00:48:05.431
What did she say?

1334
00:48:05.431 --> 00:48:05.973
I don't know.

1335
00:48:05.973 --> 00:48:06.890
I haven't checked yet.

1336
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:09.803
Let me see.

1337
00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:12.573
She said...

1338
00:48:12.573 --> 00:48:13.793
"hey."

1339
00:48:13.793 --> 00:48:15.843
She said "hey"?

1340
00:48:15.843 --> 00:48:16.533
Just "hey"?

1341
00:48:16.533 --> 00:48:17.498
Yeah.

1342
00:48:17.498 --> 00:48:18.203
Ugh.

1343
00:48:18.203 --> 00:48:19.373
You don't want hey.

1344
00:48:19.373 --> 00:48:20.273
That's not good.

1345
00:48:20.273 --> 00:48:21.563
Well, but what do I say back?

1346
00:48:21.563 --> 00:48:23.843
Do I just tell her
how pretty she is?


1347
00:48:23.843 --> 00:48:24.593
No.

1348
00:48:24.593 --> 00:48:26.273
You don't.

1349
00:48:26.273 --> 00:48:27.683
Have not learned anything?

1350
00:48:27.683 --> 00:48:28.883
You got to play it cool.

1351
00:48:28.883 --> 00:48:30.633
She's playing a mind game.

1352
00:48:30.633 --> 00:48:35.393
And when she says hey, you
got to respond back with cool.


1353
00:48:35.393 --> 00:48:37.313
Like what?

1354
00:48:37.313 --> 00:48:41.503
Just say-- just say "sup."

1355
00:48:41.503 --> 00:48:42.373
"Sup?"

1356
00:48:42.373 --> 00:48:43.093
Yeah.

1357
00:48:43.093 --> 00:48:45.783
Say "sup."

1358
00:48:45.783 --> 00:48:47.533
I'm just going to tell
her she's gorgeous.


1359
00:48:47.533 --> 00:48:48.613
No, no.

1360
00:48:48.613 --> 00:48:49.123
Do not.

1361
00:48:49.123 --> 00:48:49.543
Give me that.

1362
00:48:49.543 --> 00:48:50.043
Stop.

1363
00:48:50.043 --> 00:48:50.833
Give me.

1364
00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:52.133
Give me the phone.

1365
00:48:52.133 --> 00:48:53.143
I still have one hand.

1366
00:48:53.143 --> 00:48:54.073
Give me your phone.

1367
00:48:54.073 --> 00:48:54.523
Give me your phone.

1368
00:48:54.523 --> 00:48:55.093
Sent.

1369
00:48:55.093 --> 00:48:56.083
I did it.

1370
00:48:56.083 --> 00:48:58.923
You blew it.

1371
00:48:58.923 --> 00:49:00.303
Do you really think I blew it?

1372
00:49:00.303 --> 00:49:01.263
Yes.

1373
00:49:01.263 --> 00:49:02.583
I think you blew it.

1374
00:49:02.583 --> 00:49:04.923
That was your one
shot and you blew it.


1375
00:49:04.923 --> 00:49:06.333
Just like that Eminem song.

1376
00:49:06.333 --> 00:49:08.383
Just like the Eminem song.

1377
00:49:08.383 --> 00:49:09.088
God.

1378
00:49:09.088 --> 00:49:11.343
Well wait, how do I fix it?

1379
00:49:11.343 --> 00:49:14.223
You've heard the song.

1380
00:49:14.223 --> 00:49:17.513
"You only get one shot."

1381
00:49:17.513 --> 00:49:18.593
Farts.

1382
00:49:18.593 --> 00:49:19.493
Atta way, boys.

1383
00:49:19.493 --> 00:49:20.243
Keep it up.

1384
00:49:23.783 --> 00:49:25.333
Yo.

1385
00:49:25.333 --> 00:49:26.773
Nice play on that goal, dude.

1386
00:49:26.773 --> 00:49:27.386
Thanks, man.

1387
00:49:27.386 --> 00:49:29.053
Yeah, glad we bounced
back a little bit.


1388
00:49:29.053 --> 00:49:32.863
For real, though, I fucking
hate playing these guys.


1389
00:49:32.863 --> 00:49:34.843
So are all you guys
from here originally?


1390
00:49:34.843 --> 00:49:38.143
Yeah, I mean, most of us grew
up playing here together.


1391
00:49:38.143 --> 00:49:39.793
Proton's just a
little bit older,


1392
00:49:39.793 --> 00:49:41.063
but we've known him a while.

1393
00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:41.563
Yeah.

1394
00:49:41.563 --> 00:49:43.543
That's sort of how it was
on my old team back home.


1395
00:49:43.543 --> 00:49:44.713
Kind of took it for granted.

1396
00:49:44.713 --> 00:49:45.671
Oh, where are you from?

1397
00:49:45.671 --> 00:49:46.747
Littleton.

1398
00:49:46.747 --> 00:49:48.733
Denver area.

1399
00:49:48.733 --> 00:49:49.753
Oh shit.

1400
00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:51.163
Denver is tight.

1401
00:49:51.163 --> 00:49:53.293
Do you-- wait, do you blaze?

1402
00:49:53.293 --> 00:49:54.433
Every day, man.

1403
00:49:54.433 --> 00:49:56.563
It's been a struggle finding
some out here, though.


1404
00:49:56.563 --> 00:49:58.753
I bet it's like going back
in fucking time for you.


1405
00:49:58.753 --> 00:50:01.093
Yeah, definitely takes me
back to my high school days.


1406
00:50:01.093 --> 00:50:02.623
It sucks not having a connect.

1407
00:50:02.623 --> 00:50:05.023
Well, brother, you got one now.

1408
00:50:05.023 --> 00:50:07.716
I'll give you my number when
we're back in the locker room.


1409
00:50:07.716 --> 00:50:08.383
Are you serious?

1410
00:50:08.383 --> 00:50:09.840
Yeah, dude.

1411
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.810
Fan of your life

1412
00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:18.289
And I dropped out, burned up

1413
00:50:18.289 --> 00:50:25.744
Fought my way back from the dead

1414
00:50:25.744 --> 00:50:35.744
Tuned in, turned on, remembered
the thing that you said


1415
00:50:37.376 --> 00:50:38.293
Oh my god it's a puck!

1416
00:50:38.293 --> 00:50:38.383
Go get the puck!

1417
00:50:38.383 --> 00:50:38.925
Get the puck!

1418
00:50:42.827 --> 00:50:48.327
I'll be
your crying shoulder


1419
00:50:48.327 --> 00:50:52.755
I'll be love's suicide

1420
00:50:52.755 --> 00:50:58.940
And I'll be better
when I'm older


1421
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:08.533
I'll be the greatest
fan of your life


1422
00:51:08.533 --> 00:51:10.183
I can't believe it.

1423
00:51:10.183 --> 00:51:11.293
I cannot believe it.

1424
00:51:11.293 --> 00:51:12.943
We got an official game puck.

1425
00:51:12.943 --> 00:51:14.253
You did it.

1426
00:51:14.253 --> 00:51:15.253
Oh my God.

1427
00:51:15.253 --> 00:51:17.083
That was the new guy.

1428
00:51:17.083 --> 00:51:17.923
He deflected it.

1429
00:51:17.923 --> 00:51:20.503
Do you think he'd want
this, like, as a keepsake?


1430
00:51:20.503 --> 00:51:22.933
He might want it,
but I'm thinking


1431
00:51:22.933 --> 00:51:25.813
there's two guys that kind
of need it and deserve it,


1432
00:51:25.813 --> 00:51:26.473
you know?

1433
00:51:26.473 --> 00:51:29.293
I feel like we should hold on
to it for at least for now.


1434
00:51:29.293 --> 00:51:33.523
This would look so good on the
mantel above our fireplace.


1435
00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:35.293
That's what I'm saying.

1436
00:51:35.293 --> 00:51:38.503
Think of all the girls
that'll be coming over.


1437
00:51:38.503 --> 00:51:40.303
You mind if I--

1438
00:51:40.303 --> 00:51:41.323
Be careful with it.

1439
00:51:44.343 --> 00:51:45.633
Oh yeah.

1440
00:51:45.633 --> 00:51:48.603
Oh, it's real all right.

1441
00:51:48.603 --> 00:51:51.573
100% vulcanized rubber.

1442
00:51:51.573 --> 00:51:54.243
It's level.

1443
00:51:54.243 --> 00:51:54.783
Oh...

1444
00:51:55.963 --> 00:51:56.463
Let me.

1445
00:51:56.463 --> 00:51:56.613
Let me.

1446
00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:57.283
That is ripe.

1447
00:51:57.283 --> 00:51:57.783
Let me.

1448
00:51:57.783 --> 00:51:58.713
Come on, come on.

1449
00:51:58.713 --> 00:52:00.493
Get in there.

1450
00:52:00.493 --> 00:52:02.123
Yeah.

1451
00:52:02.123 --> 00:52:03.903
Ribbed for my pleasure.

1452
00:52:03.903 --> 00:52:05.303
Hey, numbnuts.

1453
00:52:05.303 --> 00:52:06.023
Little help?

1454
00:52:08.803 --> 00:52:10.123
Did he see us?

1455
00:52:10.123 --> 00:52:12.013
Just be quiet.

1456
00:52:12.013 --> 00:52:13.723
Holy fuck.

1457
00:52:13.723 --> 00:52:16.881
These two are as fucked
up as a soup sandwich.


1458
00:52:16.881 --> 00:52:18.053
Me?

1459
00:52:18.053 --> 00:52:18.553
Me?

1460
00:52:18.553 --> 00:52:21.103
Guys, this isn't a
fucking Stingray game.


1461
00:52:21.103 --> 00:52:24.343
I need the puck back.

1462
00:52:24.343 --> 00:52:25.873
It's OK.

1463
00:52:25.873 --> 00:52:27.973
We'll find another one.

1464
00:52:27.973 --> 00:52:29.893
One more smell.

1465
00:52:29.893 --> 00:52:32.143
There you go.

1466
00:52:32.143 --> 00:52:34.503
Holy fuck.

1467
00:52:34.503 --> 00:52:35.683
These fucking twats.

1468
00:52:39.423 --> 00:52:39.933
Here you go.

1469
00:52:43.083 --> 00:52:44.559
Fuck.

1470
00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:45.463
It's slippery.

1471
00:52:45.463 --> 00:52:45.963
It's OK.

1472
00:52:45.963 --> 00:52:48.793
We'll get another one.

1473
00:52:48.793 --> 00:52:51.843
We'll get another
one for the mantle.


1474
00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:56.973
15 miles, boys.

1475
00:52:56.973 --> 00:53:00.633
Nobody's beaten these
dickheads in two seasons.


1476
00:53:00.633 --> 00:53:03.003
Four straight losses to them.

1477
00:53:03.003 --> 00:53:05.183
Not tonight.

1478
00:53:05.183 --> 00:53:07.583
If we play these
last 15 miles hard,


1479
00:53:07.583 --> 00:53:09.456
we can fucking beat these guys.

1480
00:53:10.373 --> 00:53:13.523
Wait, 15 miles?

1481
00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:16.283
Dude, it's the same as minutes.

1482
00:53:16.283 --> 00:53:17.633
Is it though?

1483
00:53:17.633 --> 00:53:19.313
People say it.

1484
00:53:19.313 --> 00:53:21.323
I'm just trying to
say that we're close.


1485
00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:22.253
Aw.

1486
00:53:22.253 --> 00:53:24.383
Now you're trying to
sound like a cool dad.


1487
00:53:25.943 --> 00:53:27.623
Fucking guys.

1488
00:53:27.623 --> 00:53:29.633
Let's fucking go, boys.

1489
00:53:29.633 --> 00:53:30.563
Fucking right, Nick.

1490
00:53:30.563 --> 00:53:31.923
Yeah, Nick.

1491
00:53:31.923 --> 00:53:32.963
Let's go.

1492
00:53:32.963 --> 00:53:33.923
Playing great, goalie.

1493
00:53:33.923 --> 00:53:37.463
I get nothing and he gets
all the love that exists?


1494
00:53:37.463 --> 00:53:38.903
We love Nick.

1495
00:53:38.903 --> 00:53:41.483
I love him as well, but I
thought you guys loved me.


1496
00:53:41.483 --> 00:53:43.463
Anyway, let's just fucking
beat these assholes.


1497
00:53:43.463 --> 00:53:44.823
If it's for Nick, great.

1498
00:53:44.823 --> 00:53:46.253
Hey.

1499
00:53:46.253 --> 00:53:47.663
Nick!

1500
00:53:47.663 --> 00:53:48.353
Yep.

1501
00:53:48.353 --> 00:53:49.853
For Nick.

1502
00:53:49.853 --> 00:53:52.181
Let's do it for Nick.

1503
00:54:13.053 --> 00:54:16.023
All right, you pair of butt
plugs, one period to go.


1504
00:54:16.023 --> 00:54:17.893
No ties.

1505
00:54:17.893 --> 00:54:19.373
Goalie.

1506
00:54:19.373 --> 00:54:19.873
Goalie.

1507
00:55:15.673 --> 00:55:19.343
18, white, Dingleberry
with a high stick.


1508
00:55:19.343 --> 00:55:22.688
It's Razzleberry, dickhead.

1509
00:55:22.688 --> 00:55:23.563
Out of the way, guys.

1510
00:55:23.563 --> 00:55:25.333
I'm a doctor.

1511
00:55:25.333 --> 00:55:26.383
A doctor?

1512
00:55:26.383 --> 00:55:28.303
Dude, you're a fucking dentist.

1513
00:55:28.303 --> 00:55:30.420
Yeah, and it looks like
it's a mouth injury.


1514
00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.753
Let me examine the patient here.

1515
00:55:31.753 --> 00:55:32.353
OK.

1516
00:55:32.353 --> 00:55:34.243
All right, bud, I'm
sure that hurts.


1517
00:55:34.243 --> 00:55:37.543
Why don't you just hold
this on the wound for a bit.


1518
00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:38.563
Thanks, man.

1519
00:55:38.563 --> 00:55:42.583
Looks like it's a cut on
the lower left canine.


1520
00:55:42.583 --> 00:55:43.933
Oh, that's classic.

1521
00:55:43.933 --> 00:55:47.293
You carry a pink fucking
fanny pack on you?


1522
00:55:47.293 --> 00:55:49.146
Do you see how
efficient this thing is?


1523
00:55:49.146 --> 00:55:51.313
You want me to pay five
more dollars for a black one


1524
00:55:51.313 --> 00:55:52.033
or something?

1525
00:55:52.033 --> 00:55:53.353
Why?

1526
00:55:53.353 --> 00:55:54.103
Oh, Christ.

1527
00:55:54.103 --> 00:55:56.503
When you're done fumble
fucking with your gloves, like,


1528
00:55:56.503 --> 00:55:57.101
he's fine.

1529
00:55:57.101 --> 00:55:58.393
It's a long way from the heart.

1530
00:55:58.393 --> 00:55:59.503
Let's go.

1531
00:55:59.503 --> 00:56:03.433
The mouth is a crucial part
of your body's ecosystem.


1532
00:56:03.433 --> 00:56:06.403
All right here, buddy, I'm
going to get you fixed right up.


1533
00:56:06.403 --> 00:56:07.693
You got any allergies?

1534
00:56:07.693 --> 00:56:10.657
What the fuck?

1535
00:57:14.983 --> 00:57:17.613
What the fuck, Kev?

1536
00:57:17.613 --> 00:57:19.203
John, boards, boards, boards!

1537
00:57:22.513 --> 00:57:24.361
Left side, left side.

1538
00:57:24.361 --> 00:57:26.673
Down low, down low, down low.

1539
00:57:26.673 --> 00:57:28.458
Watch up.

1540
00:57:31.983 --> 00:57:34.053
That kid shouldn't
be in this league.


1541
00:57:34.053 --> 00:57:34.593
Damn it.

1542
00:57:34.593 --> 00:57:35.760
That kid's too fucking good.

1543
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.623
Holy shit.

1544
00:57:36.623 --> 00:57:38.373
Hey, buddy, more
rubber's gone through you


1545
00:57:38.373 --> 00:57:40.143
than a fucking Vegas hooker.

1546
00:57:40.143 --> 00:57:44.613
I don't recall asking for
the Ennis family backstory.


1547
00:57:44.613 --> 00:57:45.878
Fuck.

1548
00:57:45.878 --> 00:57:47.253
You guys cool if
I take it again?


1549
00:57:47.253 --> 00:57:48.243
Yeah, absolutely.

1550
00:57:48.243 --> 00:57:48.423
All right.

1551
00:57:48.423 --> 00:57:49.423
I'll win it back to you.

1552
00:57:49.423 --> 00:57:50.083
OK.

1553
00:57:50.083 --> 00:57:50.583
Here we go.

1554
00:58:04.263 --> 00:58:06.473
Don't give me that shit.

1555
00:58:06.473 --> 00:58:07.853
Fuck off, Chet.

1556
00:58:07.853 --> 00:58:08.393
Fuck.

1557
00:58:08.393 --> 00:58:10.163
Fuck you.

1558
00:58:18.493 --> 00:58:19.433
Hey, nice hit, man.

1559
00:58:19.433 --> 00:58:21.168
I don't mind seeing
Chet get dummied out


1560
00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:22.293
here every once in a while.

1561
00:58:22.293 --> 00:58:23.753
Yeah, what the fuck is
his problem, anyway?


1562
00:58:23.753 --> 00:58:24.503
I don't know, man.

1563
00:58:24.503 --> 00:58:26.533
That's just Chet.

1564
00:58:26.533 --> 00:58:28.843
Bunch of fucking clusterfucks.

1565
00:58:28.843 --> 00:58:30.793
So I guess we're the new
guys out here, right?


1566
00:58:30.793 --> 00:58:31.243
Yeah.

1567
00:58:31.243 --> 00:58:31.873
That's what I hear.

1568
00:58:31.873 --> 00:58:33.790
Well, you make it sound
like we're comparable.


1569
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:35.503
I've been off the ice
for fucking a year.


1570
00:58:35.503 --> 00:58:36.283
I don't know about you.

1571
00:58:36.283 --> 00:58:38.075
Yeah, I mean, I just
got back from juniors,


1572
00:58:38.075 --> 00:58:39.463
so I still got my legs under me.

1573
00:58:39.463 --> 00:58:41.323
OK, yeah, that explains it.

1574
00:58:41.323 --> 00:58:43.783
Well, yeah, you want to hop in?

1575
00:58:43.783 --> 00:58:47.293
No way, man, this
is beer league.


1576
00:58:47.293 --> 00:58:48.133
What the fuck?

1577
00:58:51.573 --> 00:58:54.843
63 black, 21 white.

1578
00:58:54.843 --> 00:58:57.843
Both boneheads with a rough.

1579
00:58:57.843 --> 00:58:59.513
Got it.

1580
00:58:59.513 --> 00:59:00.983
Bash brothers, right guys?

1581
00:59:03.793 --> 00:59:06.603
How's beer league treating you?

1582
00:59:06.603 --> 00:59:09.953
Oh, it could be better.

1583
00:59:09.953 --> 00:59:11.423
Just try to have fun.

1584
00:59:11.423 --> 00:59:12.203
It's a game.

1585
00:59:12.203 --> 00:59:14.633
Yeah.

1586
00:59:14.633 --> 00:59:16.763
We were so close to
getting that puck too.


1587
00:59:16.763 --> 00:59:18.713
Yeah, you went fully horizontal.

1588
00:59:18.713 --> 00:59:20.963
It was pretty impressive,
if I do say so myself.


1589
00:59:20.963 --> 00:59:21.563
It was insane.

1590
00:59:21.563 --> 00:59:23.196
Speed is my number one ability.

1591
00:59:23.196 --> 00:59:24.113
I've always said that.

1592
00:59:24.113 --> 00:59:25.313
You have always said that.

1593
00:59:25.313 --> 00:59:27.483
Thanks for supporting me.

1594
00:59:27.483 --> 00:59:28.433
I appreciate you, man.

1595
00:59:28.433 --> 00:59:29.141
Yeah, man.

1596
00:59:29.141 --> 00:59:30.683
You're really one
of my best friends.


1597
00:59:30.683 --> 00:59:31.183
Yeah, man.

1598
00:59:31.183 --> 00:59:32.921
You're my best friend too.

1599
00:59:32.921 --> 00:59:35.913
Makes me feel good.

1600
00:59:35.913 --> 00:59:37.083
Hi Hubee.

1601
00:59:37.083 --> 00:59:38.738
Hey Sondy, what's up, man?

1602
00:59:38.738 --> 00:59:40.113
I was just saying,
you missed it.


1603
00:59:40.113 --> 00:59:42.283
We had an official game
puck in the stands.


1604
00:59:42.283 --> 00:59:42.783
Really?

1605
00:59:42.783 --> 00:59:43.513
That's awesome.

1606
00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:44.403
That's very cool.

1607
00:59:44.403 --> 00:59:44.983
Yeah.

1608
00:59:44.983 --> 00:59:47.443
Yeah, it was pretty awesome.

1609
00:59:47.443 --> 00:59:51.153
Yeah, I could see how you as
a fan would think that's cool.


1610
00:59:51.153 --> 00:59:55.703
But as a player, I'm literally
throwing pucks up out


1611
00:59:55.703 --> 00:59:58.453
of my ass.

1612
00:59:58.453 --> 01:00:00.043
That's not good.

1613
01:00:00.043 --> 01:00:01.526
It is good.

1614
01:00:01.526 --> 01:00:03.943
So what time are you, me, and
Kevin going to Waffle House?


1615
01:00:03.943 --> 01:00:07.153
Oh, well, you know, Fry,
he's going to come with us.


1616
01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:09.733
Yeah, I guess we need
somebody to drive.


1617
01:00:09.733 --> 01:00:12.313
But what time are we
leaving, like, specifically?


1618
01:00:12.313 --> 01:00:14.108
So as soon as the
game is over, we're


1619
01:00:14.108 --> 01:00:15.733
getting smothered
and covered, brother.


1620
01:00:15.733 --> 01:00:17.023
Diced and chunked, bro.

1621
01:00:17.023 --> 01:00:17.623
All right.

1622
01:00:17.623 --> 01:00:18.123
All right.

1623
01:00:18.123 --> 01:00:20.053
I got to go pee all
this fruit punch out.


1624
01:00:20.053 --> 01:00:20.263
OK.

1625
01:00:20.263 --> 01:00:21.133
And then I'll be right back.

1626
01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:22.123
That sounds good, man.

1627
01:00:22.123 --> 01:00:23.803
OK.

1628
01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:26.953
Remember, you're my ride.

1629
01:00:26.953 --> 01:00:28.783
Wait, what did he say?

1630
01:00:28.783 --> 01:00:31.183
I think he said
we'd meet him there.


1631
01:00:31.183 --> 01:00:31.793
I don't know.

1632
01:00:31.793 --> 01:00:32.293
OK.

1633
01:00:32.293 --> 01:00:33.253
That sounds good.

1634
01:00:37.113 --> 01:00:37.893
Fucking pussy.

1635
01:00:43.193 --> 01:00:43.883
Yeah.

1636
01:00:43.883 --> 01:00:45.833
You're real quiet over there.

1637
01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:46.643
Excuse me?

1638
01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.923
You heard what the fuck I said.

1639
01:00:48.923 --> 01:00:50.363
Cheap shotting bitch.

1640
01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.313
Good one.

1641
01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:53.698
It was a good one.

1642
01:00:53.698 --> 01:00:55.073
Where the fuck
did you even play?


1643
01:00:55.073 --> 01:00:56.923
You're terrible.

1644
01:00:56.923 --> 01:00:59.433
I played AAA tier one, bud.

1645
01:00:59.933 --> 01:01:03.113
Well, you're in C league now,
so just shut the fuck up.


1646
01:01:03.113 --> 01:01:04.073
You shut the fuck up.

1647
01:01:04.073 --> 01:01:05.663
We're tearing you
apart out here.


1648
01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.113
Then why are you crying?

1649
01:01:07.113 --> 01:01:07.958
You're crying.

1650
01:01:17.093 --> 01:01:17.863
I'm heating up.

1651
01:01:17.863 --> 01:01:19.827
Come on.

1652
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.013
No slapshots!

1653
01:01:55.138 --> 01:01:56.635
Yeah, buddy!

1654
01:01:56.635 --> 01:01:59.130
Oh my God.

1655
01:02:03.122 --> 01:02:08.112
jersey with no
name but we're partying now


1656
01:02:08.112 --> 01:02:10.607
Meet us at Waffle House

1657
01:02:10.607 --> 01:02:13.601
It's a tied score

1658
01:02:15.596 --> 01:02:16.096
Yes!

1659
01:02:16.096 --> 01:02:16.596
Oh my God.

1660
01:02:16.596 --> 01:02:19.090
Let's go, Kevin!

1661
01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:25.577
Kevin!

1662
01:02:25.577 --> 01:02:28.072
Let's go!

1663
01:02:28.072 --> 01:02:32.563
Waffle House, Waffle
House, Waffle House, Woo!


1664
01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:46.693
Mark, time out.

1665
01:02:46.693 --> 01:02:47.993
Are you fucking serious?

1666
01:02:47.993 --> 01:02:48.493
Yeah.

1667
01:02:48.493 --> 01:02:49.483
We got to win this one.

1668
01:02:49.483 --> 01:02:50.863
Jesus Christ.

1669
01:02:50.863 --> 01:02:52.033
All right.

1670
01:02:52.933 --> 01:02:54.073
Time out, white.

1671
01:02:54.073 --> 01:02:57.313
And hurry the fuck up.

1672
01:02:57.313 --> 01:02:58.903
What the fuck are we doing?

1673
01:02:58.903 --> 01:03:00.373
Get it the fuck together.

1674
01:03:00.373 --> 01:03:02.683
We're out here letting
fucking Kevin score?


1675
01:03:02.683 --> 01:03:04.603
Jesus Christ, boys.

1676
01:03:04.603 --> 01:03:06.053
Get a fucking clue.

1677
01:03:06.053 --> 01:03:08.173
I mean, great guy, love
having beers with him,


1678
01:03:08.173 --> 01:03:09.953
but he's fucking
dog shit at hockey.


1679
01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:11.693
Chet, this is
recreational hockey, bud.


1680
01:03:11.693 --> 01:03:12.943
They're having fun over there.

1681
01:03:12.943 --> 01:03:13.723
Like, just relax.

1682
01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.703
I don't give a fuck
if they're having fun.


1683
01:03:15.703 --> 01:03:17.863
I'm trying to get a W.
The fuck are you doing?


1684
01:03:17.863 --> 01:03:19.363
Chet, it's beer league, bud.

1685
01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:20.805
Fuck you, bud.

1686
01:03:20.805 --> 01:03:22.513
Shewbs, what the fuck
are you looking at?


1687
01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:25.903
Go fuck a goat, you pigeon.

1688
01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:27.373
You dork.

1689
01:03:27.373 --> 01:03:28.843
Are you serious, dude?

1690
01:03:28.843 --> 01:03:30.283
It's late enough.

1691
01:03:30.283 --> 01:03:32.803
Yeah, man, only nerds call
time out in beer league.


1692
01:03:32.803 --> 01:03:35.143
Do you guys not care about this?

1693
01:03:35.143 --> 01:03:36.913
You guys better be
fucking shitting me.


1694
01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:38.463
Time out in goddamn beer league?

1695
01:03:38.463 --> 01:03:39.743
Dude, we got to strategize.

1696
01:03:39.743 --> 01:03:41.293
We got to beat these assholes.

1697
01:03:41.293 --> 01:03:41.893
Strategize?

1698
01:03:41.893 --> 01:03:42.793
You're not Jared Bednar.

1699
01:03:42.793 --> 01:03:43.835
It's not the Stanley Cup.

1700
01:03:43.835 --> 01:03:45.283
Settle down, wrap
it up, let's go.


1701
01:03:45.283 --> 01:03:46.003
I need to go to bed.

1702
01:03:46.003 --> 01:03:46.873
I got mouths to feed.

1703
01:03:46.873 --> 01:03:48.553
I know you probably never
been with a woman before,


1704
01:03:48.553 --> 01:03:49.783
but some of us have.

1705
01:03:49.783 --> 01:03:51.703
First off, I have
done sex before.


1706
01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:52.693
OK, yeah.

1707
01:03:52.693 --> 01:03:55.253
Second off, I can help
your family, actually.


1708
01:03:55.253 --> 01:03:58.413
I have 25% off to
my office here.


1709
01:03:58.413 --> 01:03:58.913
Come in.

1710
01:03:58.913 --> 01:04:00.563
I'll work on those
teeth of yours.


1711
01:04:00.563 --> 01:04:01.655
OK, settle down, Hermie.

1712
01:04:01.655 --> 01:04:02.363
It's after 12:00.

1713
01:04:02.363 --> 01:04:04.113
I got to get home,
feed the kids, beat it.


1714
01:04:04.113 --> 01:04:05.213
I want to go home.

1715
01:04:05.213 --> 01:04:06.803
This crazy guy is
fucking right, man.


1716
01:04:06.803 --> 01:04:07.793
Let's fucking go.

1717
01:04:07.793 --> 01:04:09.953
Who the fuck are you?

1718
01:04:09.953 --> 01:04:10.943
I'm Kevin.

1719
01:04:10.943 --> 01:04:12.413
Shut the fuck up, Kevin.

1720
01:04:12.413 --> 01:04:13.013
Over.

1721
01:04:13.013 --> 01:04:13.513
Done.

1722
01:04:13.513 --> 01:04:15.443
Get out.

1723
01:04:15.443 --> 01:04:16.883
Alright, fuck that guy.

1724
01:04:16.883 --> 01:04:18.983
You are the reason that
we're still here, Kevin.


1725
01:04:18.983 --> 01:04:21.721
We have time to win.

1726
01:04:21.721 --> 01:04:22.763
Let's fucking do it, man.

1727
01:04:22.763 --> 01:04:24.743
Let's win, I guess.

1728
01:04:24.743 --> 01:04:25.440
Are you sure?

1729
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.023
How long are time
outs in this league?


1730
01:04:27.023 --> 01:04:28.760
Dude, too fucking long.

1731
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.593
Well you don't sound
very confident in that.


1732
01:04:34.993 --> 01:04:37.153
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

1733
01:04:37.153 --> 01:04:37.813
Good job, man.

1734
01:04:37.813 --> 01:04:40.081
We'll get point, point.

1735
01:04:47.943 --> 01:04:49.193
Walking right down the middle.

1736
01:04:49.193 --> 01:04:50.773
What are we doing?

1737
01:04:50.773 --> 01:04:51.733
Left, left, left.

1738
01:04:51.733 --> 01:04:53.353
Clear it, clear it.

1739
01:04:53.353 --> 01:04:54.673
Down low, down low.

1740
01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:56.353
I got him.

1741
01:04:56.353 --> 01:04:57.133
Got it.

1742
01:04:57.133 --> 01:04:58.813
Come on, Nick.

1743
01:04:58.813 --> 01:04:59.653
Oh no, don't.

1744
01:04:59.653 --> 01:05:01.063
Oh Kevin, that's a shitty plan.

1745
01:05:04.573 --> 01:05:06.393
Let's get out, boys.

1746
01:05:06.393 --> 01:05:07.643
Stop letting him skate around.

1747
01:05:07.643 --> 01:05:08.420
Across.

1748
01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.003
Come on, boys.

1749
01:05:09.003 --> 01:05:09.670
Let's get to OT.

1750
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:10.560
There we go, Nick.

1751
01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.393
Keep it going, boys.

1752
01:05:11.393 --> 01:05:12.413
Keep the pressure up.

1753
01:05:12.413 --> 01:05:13.293
Oh fuck.

1754
01:05:13.293 --> 01:05:15.083
Oh fuck, still
loose. still loose.


1755
01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:17.813
Go to the net.

1756
01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:18.713
Up, up, up, up.

1757
01:05:21.783 --> 01:05:23.273
Come on boys, get it out.

1758
01:05:23.273 --> 01:05:25.718
Get it out.

1759
01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:26.343
Get that going.

1760
01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:26.843
Clear it.

1761
01:05:29.523 --> 01:05:30.873
I am wide open.

1762
01:05:30.873 --> 01:05:31.420
Someone look.

1763
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:31.920
Look.

1764
01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.053
Look up.

1765
01:05:34.053 --> 01:05:34.653
Fuck off me.

1766
01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:39.148
Put some pressure on.

1767
01:05:39.148 --> 01:05:41.573
Woo.

1768
01:05:41.573 --> 01:05:43.133
10 seconds, boys, 10 seconds.

1769
01:05:46.093 --> 01:05:47.933
Come on, guys.

1770
01:05:47.933 --> 01:05:48.893
Nice one, Nick.

1771
01:05:48.893 --> 01:05:49.973
Keep it out.

1772
01:05:49.973 --> 01:05:50.493
Cover it.

1773
01:05:50.493 --> 01:05:50.993
Under it.

1774
01:05:50.993 --> 01:05:52.210
Lay on it.

1775
01:06:19.573 --> 01:06:21.863
Ha, I think she
wants to meet up.


1776
01:06:21.863 --> 01:06:23.663
I told you this would work.

1777
01:06:23.663 --> 01:06:24.893
She wants to meet up?

1778
01:06:24.893 --> 01:06:25.463
Yes.

1779
01:06:25.463 --> 01:06:26.183
With you?

1780
01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:26.783
Yes.

1781
01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:27.713
Tonight?

1782
01:06:27.713 --> 01:06:29.717
Also true.

1783
01:06:31.103 --> 01:06:32.513
You know what that means?

1784
01:06:32.513 --> 01:06:35.393
She is DTP.

1785
01:06:35.393 --> 01:06:37.583
I don't know what that means.

1786
01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:38.333
Down to plow.

1787
01:06:41.483 --> 01:06:43.643
Like sex?

1788
01:06:43.643 --> 01:06:44.153
Yeah.

1789
01:06:44.153 --> 01:06:45.143
Like sex.

1790
01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:49.163
You know, making love.

1791
01:06:49.163 --> 01:06:52.469
I mean, I know what it is.

1792
01:06:52.469 --> 01:06:55.963
It just scares me a lot.

1793
01:06:55.963 --> 01:06:57.143
It's OK to be scared, buddy.

1794
01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:58.853
But you have to do it.

1795
01:06:58.853 --> 01:06:59.561
But no, I don't.

1796
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:02.103
I just wanted to go dancing or
something and get to know her.


1797
01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:03.453
She asked you to go dancing?

1798
01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:06.123
I'm going to ask
her to go dancing.


1799
01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:08.313
She's going to know that
that is code for sex.


1800
01:07:08.313 --> 01:07:10.743
Be careful what you say.

1801
01:07:10.743 --> 01:07:12.393
Dancing means sex now?

1802
01:07:12.393 --> 01:07:13.516
Dancing means sex now.

1803
01:07:13.516 --> 01:07:15.183
I have been out of
the game a long time.


1804
01:07:15.183 --> 01:07:16.233
Yeah.

1805
01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:17.643
I'm going to invite
her to dance.


1806
01:07:17.643 --> 01:07:21.363
If she wants to eff, she
can find somebody else.


1807
01:07:21.363 --> 01:07:23.703
Way to go, Captain Duck.

1808
01:07:23.703 --> 01:07:26.283
Top notch time out.

1809
01:07:26.283 --> 01:07:27.903
I'm so tired.

1810
01:07:27.903 --> 01:07:30.543
Why the hell did I tie it up?

1811
01:07:30.543 --> 01:07:32.233
Stupid.

1812
01:07:32.233 --> 01:07:34.233
I mean, K-dawg, you can
leave whenever you want.


1813
01:07:34.233 --> 01:07:36.423
It's OK, for real.

1814
01:07:36.423 --> 01:07:37.173
It's cool with me.

1815
01:07:37.173 --> 01:07:38.313
Later, Kev.

1816
01:07:38.313 --> 01:07:39.213
See you.

1817
01:07:39.213 --> 01:07:41.313
Guys, guys, winning
is so much fun.


1818
01:07:41.313 --> 01:07:43.173
I'm joking.

1819
01:07:43.173 --> 01:07:44.973
I mean, he is the
funny guy on the team.


1820
01:07:48.943 --> 01:07:50.503
Not cool, man.

1821
01:07:50.503 --> 01:07:53.368
So do you guys do overtime
or straight to shootout?


1822
01:07:53.368 --> 01:07:54.493
We go straight to shootout.

1823
01:07:54.493 --> 01:07:56.503
And since Sondy's
team went 40 rounds,


1824
01:07:56.503 --> 01:07:57.703
we're only doing three now.

1825
01:07:57.703 --> 01:07:59.233
So.

1826
01:07:59.233 --> 01:08:00.403
Yes, Kevin?

1827
01:08:00.403 --> 01:08:02.563
Please let me shoot.

1828
01:08:02.563 --> 01:08:03.563
No.

1829
01:08:03.563 --> 01:08:04.393
No.

1830
01:08:04.393 --> 01:08:05.873
No way, dude.

1831
01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:06.373
No.

1832
01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:07.813
Absolutely not.

1833
01:08:07.813 --> 01:08:10.303
I've had the hot stick
all freaking night.


1834
01:08:10.303 --> 01:08:11.413
No.

1835
01:08:11.413 --> 01:08:12.141
No.

1836
01:08:12.141 --> 01:08:13.183
It's not even your stick.

1837
01:08:13.183 --> 01:08:13.683
Yeah.

1838
01:08:13.683 --> 01:08:14.533
I'll take that back.

1839
01:08:14.533 --> 01:08:16.908
And I'm going to be actually
going first in the shootout.


1840
01:08:16.908 --> 01:08:18.972
Huge branding
opportunity for JCD.


1841
01:08:18.972 --> 01:08:20.023
You guys get it.

1842
01:08:20.023 --> 01:08:22.813
I can match this slick
Casey kid's moves.


1843
01:08:22.813 --> 01:08:24.583
Then we're going to
have Noel go second.


1844
01:08:24.583 --> 01:08:26.281
I mean, he's been
fantastic tonight.


1845
01:08:26.281 --> 01:08:28.573
And then-- and then guys,
what do you think about Riley


1846
01:08:28.573 --> 01:08:29.448
taking the third one?

1847
01:08:29.448 --> 01:08:30.432
Yeah, I'm OK with that.

1848
01:08:30.432 --> 01:08:31.483
Well, wait, are you sure?

1849
01:08:31.483 --> 01:08:31.813
Yeah, I like that.

1850
01:08:31.813 --> 01:08:33.222
You've been great tonight.

1851
01:08:33.222 --> 01:08:35.323
Kev, what's your problem?

1852
01:08:35.323 --> 01:08:38.383
My problem is, like, y'all pick
him over me in the shootout


1853
01:08:38.383 --> 01:08:40.603
and, like, I've been
here for, like--


1854
01:08:40.603 --> 01:08:43.273
I'm putting my skate
down for the last time.


1855
01:08:43.273 --> 01:08:45.743
It's either me or him.

1856
01:08:45.743 --> 01:08:46.243
Riley.

1857
01:08:46.243 --> 01:08:47.533
Cool, Riley, welcome.

1858
01:08:47.533 --> 01:08:48.733
Yeah.

1859
01:08:48.733 --> 01:08:50.233
I mean, he paid in full.

1860
01:08:50.233 --> 01:08:51.979
You still owe $171.

1861
01:08:56.063 --> 01:08:56.783
What?

1862
01:08:56.783 --> 01:08:59.092
You paid $29?

1863
01:08:59.092 --> 01:08:59.722
Yeah.

1864
01:08:59.722 --> 01:09:00.732
How?

1865
01:09:00.732 --> 01:09:01.232
Why?

1866
01:09:03.983 --> 01:09:05.398
Well.

1867
01:09:05.398 --> 01:09:06.273
What the fuck, Kevin.

1868
01:09:06.273 --> 01:09:08.520
I don't even want to hear
what your excuse is, Kevin.


1869
01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.353
I was going to tell you
guys about it later.


1870
01:09:10.353 --> 01:09:12.733
No, I don't want to hear it.

1871
01:09:12.733 --> 01:09:15.243
My parents are going
through a divorce, guys.


1872
01:09:15.243 --> 01:09:17.033
You're a grown man.

1873
01:09:17.033 --> 01:09:19.026
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1874
01:09:19.026 --> 01:09:20.693
Erin, you're going
to have to keep track


1875
01:09:20.693 --> 01:09:21.860
of the score and everything.

1876
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:22.863
I need a break.

1877
01:09:22.863 --> 01:09:23.363
OK.

1878
01:09:47.243 --> 01:09:48.223
Don't worry, boys.

1879
01:09:51.163 --> 01:09:53.903
That wasn't too bad, eh boys?

1880
01:09:53.903 --> 01:09:55.433
Let's get one and tie it up.

1881
01:09:55.433 --> 01:09:57.652
Come on, Johnny.

1882
01:10:08.473 --> 01:10:09.473
Damn, that's a good fit.

1883
01:10:13.303 --> 01:10:17.771
Shit, all the kids are coming
to JCD when they see this.


1884
01:10:17.771 --> 01:10:19.063
Oh my God, I did the spin move.

1885
01:10:19.063 --> 01:10:20.638
Here it comes, the
big TikTok moment.


1886
01:10:23.573 --> 01:10:25.943
Well, fuck, man.

1887
01:10:25.943 --> 01:10:26.993
Did not go as planned.

1888
01:10:29.753 --> 01:10:30.773
Holy shit, John.

1889
01:10:30.773 --> 01:10:33.119
Hit it with your
purse next time.


1890
01:10:33.119 --> 01:10:34.473
Hockey is not your thing, dude.

1891
01:10:34.473 --> 01:10:36.483
Whatever, man, I
nailed the spin move.


1892
01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:38.553
My dangles would have
been way more tight.


1893
01:10:38.553 --> 01:10:41.223
Shut the hell up, Kevin.

1894
01:10:41.223 --> 01:10:43.103
Oh man, it's Gallagher.

1895
01:10:43.103 --> 01:10:44.473
He's got pretty solid flow.

1896
01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:45.656
He's no Casey, but.

1897
01:10:45.656 --> 01:10:47.573
Why are you so obsessed
with everybody's hair?


1898
01:10:47.573 --> 01:10:49.303
It's getting kind
of weird, honestly.


1899
01:10:49.303 --> 01:10:49.963
Let's go, Nick.

1900
01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:56.233
Yeah!

1901
01:10:56.233 --> 01:10:59.113
Woo!

1902
01:10:59.113 --> 01:11:00.573
Big dick Nick!

1903
01:11:00.573 --> 01:11:02.573
Big dick Nick!

1904
01:11:02.573 --> 01:11:04.073
Big dick Nick!

1905
01:11:04.073 --> 01:11:06.099
Big dick Nick!

1906
01:11:07.053 --> 01:11:09.693
Noel, you're up.

1907
01:11:09.693 --> 01:11:12.189
It's time.

1908
01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:23.013
Let's go, Noel.

1909
01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:26.483
You got it.

1910
01:11:26.483 --> 01:11:28.143
I chose you for a reason, Noel.

1911
01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:30.363
You got this.

1912
01:11:30.363 --> 01:11:31.613
You got this, Noely.

1913
01:11:31.613 --> 01:11:34.203
He can't even stop a beach ball.

1914
01:11:34.203 --> 01:11:34.863
Right, guys?

1915
01:11:39.263 --> 01:11:41.239
Let's go, let's go.

1916
01:11:41.239 --> 01:11:41.739
Go home.

1917
01:11:57.783 --> 01:11:58.283
Nice.

1918
01:12:02.603 --> 01:12:03.713
All right, cutie.

1919
01:12:03.713 --> 01:12:04.793
You're not that cute.

1920
01:12:04.793 --> 01:12:06.653
You might be cute,
but Kevin's never


1921
01:12:06.653 --> 01:12:08.579
going to Wild Wings with you.

1922
01:12:08.579 --> 01:12:09.433
That's right.

1923
01:12:09.433 --> 01:12:10.318
He likes us.

1924
01:12:19.103 --> 01:12:20.423
Big dick Nick!

1925
01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:21.923
Big dick Nick!

1926
01:12:21.923 --> 01:12:23.453
Big dick Nick!

1927
01:12:23.453 --> 01:12:25.553
Big dick Nick!

1928
01:12:25.553 --> 01:12:26.993
No.

1929
01:12:26.993 --> 01:12:30.173
No, no, no.

1930
01:12:30.173 --> 01:12:31.013
It's not working.

1931
01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:31.583
It's OK.

1932
01:12:31.583 --> 01:12:32.500
We'll get another one.

1933
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.873
What did I tell you idiots
about that fucking air horn?


1934
01:12:35.873 --> 01:12:37.133
It's not even working.

1935
01:12:37.133 --> 01:12:38.348
It's flat.

1936
01:12:38.348 --> 01:12:40.223
I'll come up there and
show you fucking flat.


1937
01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:40.763
Put it away.

1938
01:12:40.763 --> 01:12:42.723
I'm sick of talking
to you two idiots.


1939
01:12:42.723 --> 01:12:43.913
No.

1940
01:12:43.913 --> 01:12:45.653
Stop threatening to
flatten my friend.


1941
01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.393
That's every week you do that.

1942
01:12:47.393 --> 01:12:48.000
Quit it.

1943
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.583
Buddy, I'll flatten
the both of youse.


1944
01:12:49.583 --> 01:12:50.393
Cut the shit.

1945
01:12:50.393 --> 01:12:52.253
You could be our Vince
if you wanted to.


1946
01:12:52.253 --> 01:12:53.393
He couldn't be our Vince.

1947
01:12:53.393 --> 01:12:54.563
Johnny Drama.

1948
01:12:54.563 --> 01:12:55.523
These fucking nerds.

1949
01:12:55.523 --> 01:12:57.083
I can't fucking do this anymore.

1950
01:12:57.083 --> 01:12:58.061
Fucking losers.

1951
01:12:58.061 --> 01:13:00.353
Waffle House meeting later
if you want to check it out.


1952
01:13:00.353 --> 01:13:02.593
You could be there.

1953
01:13:02.593 --> 01:13:04.596
If Riley scores, we
beat the Young Genos.


1954
01:13:08.853 --> 01:13:10.413
Let's go, Riley.

1955
01:13:10.413 --> 01:13:11.773
Fucking bury it, baby.

1956
01:13:11.773 --> 01:13:12.393
Let's go.

1957
01:13:37.053 --> 01:13:38.921
Fuck this shit, dude.

1958
01:13:38.921 --> 01:13:42.793
Roley, Roley, Roley.

1959
01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:43.903
Oh shit.

1960
01:13:43.903 --> 01:13:46.325
The Blazers must be calling.

1961
01:13:47.473 --> 01:13:48.163
Let's go.

1962
01:13:48.163 --> 01:13:49.253
Yeah, boys.

1963
01:13:49.253 --> 01:13:50.826
Oh yeah, beer's on us.

1964
01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:51.493
Good game, boys.

1965
01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.143
Right, boys.

1966
01:13:53.143 --> 01:13:53.683
Great game.

1967
01:13:53.683 --> 01:13:54.883
Good game, Casey.

1968
01:13:54.883 --> 01:13:55.793
Good game, guys.

1969
01:13:55.793 --> 01:13:56.293
Good game.

1970
01:13:56.293 --> 01:13:57.103
Almost got it, man.

1971
01:13:57.103 --> 01:13:58.273
You almost had us.

1972
01:13:58.273 --> 01:13:59.323
Good game, boys.

1973
01:13:59.323 --> 01:14:00.553
Come on to my office.

1974
01:14:00.553 --> 01:14:04.143
Send your parents the bill.

1975
01:14:04.143 --> 01:14:05.863
Nice fucking slappy.

1976
01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:06.663
Thanks, Kevin.

1977
01:14:06.663 --> 01:14:07.683
That was awesome.

1978
01:14:07.683 --> 01:14:09.573
I've been thinking about it.

1979
01:14:09.573 --> 01:14:11.306
There can be two funny
guys on the team.


1980
01:14:11.306 --> 01:14:11.973
Appreciate that.

1981
01:14:11.973 --> 01:14:12.513
Yeah, man.

1982
01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:13.613
I think you got something
on your sweater.


1983
01:14:13.613 --> 01:14:14.163
Do I really?

1984
01:14:14.163 --> 01:14:14.853
Boop.

1985
01:14:14.853 --> 01:14:16.168
Dude, that's my fucking joke.

1986
01:14:16.168 --> 01:14:17.793
Well, I'm the funny
guy now too, right?


1987
01:14:17.793 --> 01:14:19.053
Get off the fucking ice.

1988
01:14:19.053 --> 01:14:19.653
Let's go.

1989
01:14:19.653 --> 01:14:20.343
Screw.

1990
01:14:20.343 --> 01:14:20.913
Night's over.

1991
01:14:20.913 --> 01:14:21.543
Bye.

1992
01:14:21.543 --> 01:14:22.533
He stole my joke.

1993
01:14:28.823 --> 01:14:29.633
It's OK.

1994
01:14:29.633 --> 01:14:31.403
Let's get waffles.

1995
01:14:32.943 --> 01:14:34.753
Fuck yeah, boys.

1996
01:14:34.753 --> 01:14:36.103
Hell yeah.

1997
01:14:36.103 --> 01:14:37.093
Let's go.

1998
01:14:37.093 --> 01:14:38.308
Fucking right.

1999
01:14:42.313 --> 01:14:43.033
Told you, bud.

2000
01:14:43.033 --> 01:14:44.533
I told you.

2001
01:14:44.533 --> 01:14:45.973
Holy shit, boys.

2002
01:14:45.973 --> 01:14:47.323
What a game.

2003
01:14:47.323 --> 01:14:49.283
Fuck those dudes, am I right?

2004
01:14:49.283 --> 01:14:52.323
Guys, Young Genos.

2005
01:14:52.323 --> 01:14:54.383
We beat Young Genos!

2006
01:14:54.383 --> 01:14:55.683
Fuck yeah, we did.

2007
01:14:55.683 --> 01:14:56.733
Yeah.

2008
01:14:56.733 --> 01:14:58.893
Did you see the fucking
look on Chet's face?


2009
01:14:58.893 --> 01:14:59.643
Holy shit.

2010
01:14:59.643 --> 01:15:02.673
The one where Casey pulled off
a sicker dangle than he ever


2011
01:15:02.673 --> 01:15:06.933
could or the one where Riley
put him on his fucking ass?


2012
01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:08.208
Fuck that guy!

2013
01:15:11.403 --> 01:15:14.353
I'd do anything to
see Chet cry again.


2014
01:15:14.353 --> 01:15:17.643
Well, we play him
again next month.


2015
01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:18.868
Bro, come on.

2016
01:15:18.868 --> 01:15:20.493
I'm trying to savor
the fucking moment.


2017
01:15:21.033 --> 01:15:21.783
Clothes on?

2018
01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:23.613
Yeah, you're good.

2019
01:15:23.613 --> 01:15:25.981
Good fucking show, boys.

2020
01:15:25.981 --> 01:15:26.523
Thanks, Erin.

2021
01:15:26.523 --> 01:15:28.533
Wow, you guys reek
more than normal.


2022
01:15:28.533 --> 01:15:29.851
Yeah, reeks like victory.

2023
01:15:29.851 --> 01:15:31.143
Oh, you left this on the bench.

2024
01:15:31.143 --> 01:15:31.803
Oh shit.

2025
01:15:31.803 --> 01:15:33.173
Thank you so much.

2026
01:15:33.173 --> 01:15:34.923
Do you mind giving one
of these to the guy


2027
01:15:34.923 --> 01:15:36.163
on Young Genos that got hurt?

2028
01:15:36.163 --> 01:15:36.663
Sure.

2029
01:15:36.663 --> 01:15:37.833
Thanks so much.

2030
01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.473
How are you feeling?

2031
01:15:39.473 --> 01:15:41.603
Exhausted.

2032
01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:43.640
Short bench sucks, but
you guys pulled it off.


2033
01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.473
And I think you lucked
out with the new guy.


2034
01:15:45.473 --> 01:15:46.533
Oh.

2035
01:15:46.533 --> 01:15:47.483
Yeah, we did.

2036
01:15:47.483 --> 01:15:48.173
Fuck yeah.

2037
01:15:48.173 --> 01:15:48.673
All right.

2038
01:15:48.673 --> 01:15:49.403
Good game, boys.

2039
01:15:49.403 --> 01:15:50.195
See you at the bar.

2040
01:15:50.195 --> 01:15:50.993
Hell yeah.

2041
01:15:50.993 --> 01:15:51.743
I'll call you.

2042
01:15:51.743 --> 01:15:52.418
Eat shit, Kevin.

2043
01:15:57.183 --> 01:15:57.783
Erin's right.

2044
01:15:57.783 --> 01:15:59.653
We would have been
screwed without Riley.


2045
01:15:59.653 --> 01:16:01.563
Oh, dude, 100%.

2046
01:16:01.563 --> 01:16:02.163
Thanks.

2047
01:16:02.163 --> 01:16:03.996
I was just trying not
to slow you guys down.


2048
01:16:03.996 --> 01:16:05.383
I'm glad we pulled it off.

2049
01:16:05.383 --> 01:16:06.183
Slow us down?

2050
01:16:06.183 --> 01:16:06.933
Come on, Riley.

2051
01:16:06.933 --> 01:16:09.123
Yeah, dude, you crushed it on D.

2052
01:16:09.123 --> 01:16:12.093
And dude, you were killer
on those face offs, buddy.


2053
01:16:12.093 --> 01:16:13.803
Well, thanks.

2054
01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:15.903
I appreciate you guys
letting me sub in.


2055
01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:19.613
Nah, dude, that's yours.

2056
01:16:19.613 --> 01:16:20.513
Are you serious?

2057
01:16:20.513 --> 01:16:21.803
Absolutely.

2058
01:16:21.803 --> 01:16:23.643
You earned it.

2059
01:16:23.643 --> 01:16:25.563
You realize I'm
the captain, right?


2060
01:16:25.563 --> 01:16:28.703
I make final player decisions.

2061
01:16:28.703 --> 01:16:30.053
Welcome to the team, bud.

2062
01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:31.523
Thanks.

2063
01:16:31.523 --> 01:16:32.033
Absolutely.

2064
01:16:32.033 --> 01:16:34.473
You paid in full.

2065
01:16:34.473 --> 01:16:35.343
Who wants a latte?

2066
01:16:35.343 --> 01:16:35.843
Hey.

2067
01:16:40.043 --> 01:16:41.113
Riley.

2068
01:16:41.113 --> 01:16:41.613
Yeah.

2069
01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.553
I'll take a cold cruiser.

2070
01:16:46.553 --> 01:16:47.416
Yeah.

2071
01:16:47.416 --> 01:16:48.083
Fuck yeah, Noel.

2072
01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:48.713
Thanks, bud.

2073
01:16:48.713 --> 01:16:51.293
Beer here.

2074
01:16:51.293 --> 01:16:52.733
Dude, I'm good, thanks.

2075
01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:54.623
I know, baby.

2076
01:16:54.623 --> 01:16:56.013
What?

2077
01:16:56.013 --> 01:16:57.593
You're too good to me.

2078
01:16:57.593 --> 01:16:58.093
Hey.

2079
01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:06.413
I can't get this straw out.

2080
01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:06.953
Hey.

2081
01:17:06.953 --> 01:17:08.515
There he is.

2082
01:17:08.515 --> 01:17:09.913
Ah, man.

2083
01:17:13.183 --> 01:17:15.823
So is no one going to
talk about Kevin's goal?


2084
01:17:15.823 --> 01:17:16.693
No.

2085
01:17:16.693 --> 01:17:18.679
Come on.

2086
01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:20.453
Did Kevin even score?

2087
01:17:20.453 --> 01:17:20.953
I did.

2088
01:17:20.953 --> 01:17:22.078
Dude, that was that heater.

2089
01:17:22.078 --> 01:17:23.143
You were working on that.

2090
01:17:23.143 --> 01:17:25.763
Told you to get out of the way.

2091
01:17:25.763 --> 01:17:28.573
Hey, you know I got
something for our boy.


2092
01:17:32.063 --> 01:17:33.863
Let's go.

2093
01:17:33.863 --> 01:17:35.423
Kevin.

2094
01:17:37.913 --> 01:17:38.843
Thanks, boys.

2095
01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:40.998
Love you.

2096
01:17:40.998 --> 01:17:41.873
Good to see you, man.

2097
01:17:41.873 --> 01:17:42.413
It's been a minute.

2098
01:17:42.413 --> 01:17:42.953
How's everything going?

2099
01:17:42.953 --> 01:17:43.643
All right?

2100
01:17:43.643 --> 01:17:44.903
Oh, I mean it's going good.

2101
01:17:44.903 --> 01:17:47.123
You know, family's
really happy to see me,


2102
01:17:47.123 --> 01:17:48.800
being back from juniors and all.

2103
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.633
It can get pretty crazy
out there, you know.


2104
01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:51.923
Yeah, I heard a
few of the stories.


2105
01:17:51.923 --> 01:17:53.033
It gets a little wild up there.

2106
01:17:53.033 --> 01:17:54.450
Oh boy, these guys
are coming out.


2107
01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:56.003
Listen, youngblood,
you take care.


2108
01:17:56.003 --> 01:17:56.933
Tell the family I said hello.

2109
01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:57.473
We'll be in touch.

2110
01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:57.803
Hit me up.

2111
01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:58.303
Will do.

2112
01:17:58.303 --> 01:17:58.970
I appreciate it.

2113
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:00.636
Love to see you in
the office this week.


2114
01:18:00.636 --> 01:18:02.423
Yeah, I'd love to see
you in another rink.


2115
01:18:02.423 --> 01:18:04.013
Fucking guy.

2116
01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.393
Dude, you were insane
out there tonight.


2117
01:18:06.393 --> 01:18:07.413
I appreciate it, man.

2118
01:18:07.413 --> 01:18:08.063
Thank you.

2119
01:18:08.063 --> 01:18:10.163
I really can't believe
we beat you guys.


2120
01:18:10.163 --> 01:18:11.963
I'm kind of in
shock myself, man.


2121
01:18:11.963 --> 01:18:15.893
Like, the boys in that room,
they treat it like the NHL.


2122
01:18:15.893 --> 01:18:17.883
Seriously.

2123
01:18:17.883 --> 01:18:18.773
Oh, duty calls.

2124
01:18:18.773 --> 01:18:20.453
Got to get this
guy to the office.


2125
01:18:20.453 --> 01:18:22.463
Riley, thanks so much
for showing up, dude.


2126
01:18:22.463 --> 01:18:23.723
Appreciate it.

2127
01:18:23.723 --> 01:18:24.408
Later, man.

2128
01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:25.283
John, see you, buddy.

2129
01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:26.693
Proton, bye man.

2130
01:18:26.693 --> 01:18:29.093
Hey, are you still on
your parents' insurance?


2131
01:18:29.093 --> 01:18:32.078
So Case, Young Genos?

2132
01:18:32.078 --> 01:18:34.543
You actually like
playing for those guys?


2133
01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:38.603
I mean, the boys aren't too
bad, but it's just Chet, man.


2134
01:18:38.603 --> 01:18:42.173
Sometimes I just can't
play with that guy.


2135
01:18:42.173 --> 01:18:43.583
I hear you.

2136
01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:45.873
Well, I think I can
speak for everyone.


2137
01:18:45.873 --> 01:18:47.623
We'd love to have
you on our squad.


2138
01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:49.831
I know for sure we've got
some room on the blue line.


2139
01:18:49.831 --> 01:18:50.933
Can I do that, boys?

2140
01:18:50.933 --> 01:18:51.833
I mean.

2141
01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:52.623
Bye, guys.

2142
01:18:52.623 --> 01:18:53.123
See you.

2143
01:18:53.123 --> 01:18:53.933
Bye guys.

2144
01:18:53.933 --> 01:18:56.583
I mean, did you pay?

2145
01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:59.813
There's nobody at the
front desk tonight, so no.


2146
01:18:59.813 --> 01:19:01.126
Sounds like your golden, bud.

2147
01:19:01.126 --> 01:19:03.293
Does this mean I don't have
to play defense anymore?


2148
01:19:03.293 --> 01:19:04.763
I think so.

2149
01:19:04.763 --> 01:19:07.993
Does this mean the Polly's Pies
just became the team to beat?


2150
01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:08.773
I think so, dude.

2151
01:19:08.773 --> 01:19:10.103
Yeah, absolutely.

2152
01:19:10.103 --> 01:19:11.923
Heck yeah.

2153
01:19:11.923 --> 01:19:12.908
Good game, boys.

2154
01:19:12.908 --> 01:19:13.750
You too, Nick.

2155
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:14.333
See you, Nick.

2156
01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.463
Supposed to hate you,
but that move was sick.


2157
01:19:16.463 --> 01:19:17.423
Appreciate it, goalie.

2158
01:19:17.423 --> 01:19:18.713
Thanks, man.

2159
01:19:18.713 --> 01:19:21.863
Well hey, what are
you doing Tuesday?


2160
01:19:21.863 --> 01:19:23.243
I got nothing going on.

2161
01:19:23.243 --> 01:19:24.923
Want to do Tuesday
morning pick up?


2162
01:19:24.923 --> 01:19:26.043
Tuesday morning pick up.

2163
01:19:26.043 --> 01:19:26.543
Cool, man.

2164
01:19:26.543 --> 01:19:27.243
I'll see you there, bud.

2165
01:19:27.243 --> 01:19:27.953
I'll see you there, boys.

2166
01:19:27.953 --> 01:19:28.703
Have a good night.

2167
01:19:28.703 --> 01:19:30.173
Yeah, absolutely.

2168
01:19:30.173 --> 01:19:33.453
Speaking of Tuesday mornings,
you want to do some pickup?


2169
01:19:33.453 --> 01:19:35.103
I got to knock off
some of this rust.


2170
01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:36.033
Yeah, you do.

2171
01:19:36.963 --> 01:19:42.363
Dude, who takes a fucking
slapper on a shootout?


2172
01:19:42.363 --> 01:19:43.298
Love it.

2173
01:19:43.298 --> 01:19:44.673
Dude, I'm glad
you came out, man.


2174
01:19:44.673 --> 01:19:46.722
I'll see you.

2175
01:19:46.722 --> 01:19:49.620
The things
it seems and more


2176
01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.963
But that final day will come

2177
01:19:52.963 --> 01:19:57.113
It comes to everyone

2178
01:19:57.113 --> 01:20:04.523
The accidents of birth can make
it hard to speak one's mind


2179
01:20:04.523 --> 01:20:08.093
But I believe there's power here

2180
01:20:08.093 --> 01:20:10.698
Just not that I can find

2181
01:20:10.698 --> 01:20:17.789
I'm not aimed on dying

2182
01:20:17.789 --> 01:20:21.765
Ooh

2183
01:20:55.064 --> 01:20:58.543
You're in a dance and you must

2184
01:20:58.543 --> 01:21:04.513
Maintain until it's done

2185
01:21:04.513 --> 01:21:06.883
Fucking late as fuck, dude.

2186
01:21:06.883 --> 01:21:08.923
Jesus Christ.

2187
01:21:08.923 --> 01:21:09.803
He's coming.

2188
01:21:09.803 --> 01:21:10.723
Oh fuck.

2189
01:21:10.723 --> 01:21:11.733
Waffle House time.

2190
01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.283
Woo, baby.

2191
01:21:13.283 --> 01:21:16.365
I guess I'll go to Waffle House.

2192
01:21:16.365 --> 01:21:18.073
What are you still
doing here, fuckstick?


2193
01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.323
I thought I was going to
go home to my boys, but.


2194
01:21:20.323 --> 01:21:20.953
Shocker.

2195
01:21:20.953 --> 01:21:23.023
They want to go to Waffle House.

2196
01:21:23.023 --> 01:21:24.283
And I don't give a shit.

2197
01:21:24.283 --> 01:21:25.123
We're done.

2198
01:21:25.123 --> 01:21:25.703
Game over.

2199
01:21:25.703 --> 01:21:26.203
Goodbye.

2200
01:21:26.203 --> 01:21:27.343
Do you want to hang out?

2201
01:21:27.343 --> 01:21:27.913
No, I'm good.

2202
01:21:27.913 --> 01:21:28.363
Spider.

2203
01:21:28.363 --> 01:21:28.753
See you later.

2204
01:21:28.753 --> 01:21:29.253
You sure?

2205
01:21:29.253 --> 01:21:29.805
Yeah.

2206
01:21:29.805 --> 01:21:31.513
You got 10 minutes,
I'm calling the cops.


2207
01:21:31.513 --> 01:21:33.101
You're trespassing.

2208
01:21:33.101 --> 01:21:33.643
I'll see you.

2209
01:21:33.643 --> 01:21:34.183
10 minutes.

2210
01:21:34.183 --> 01:21:35.113
Bye.

2211
01:21:35.113 --> 01:21:37.913
Love you.

2212
01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:54.533
Come tomorrow
we will compromise


2213
01:21:54.533 --> 01:22:00.200
I'll push harder and
you'll sleep at night


2214
01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.331
Buy you dinner, we'll
fall back in love


2215
01:22:04.331 --> 01:22:09.677
A good scenario for making up

2216
01:22:09.677 --> 01:22:16.123
And you say OK

2217
01:22:16.123 --> 01:22:21.302
I mean what's there to lose

2218
01:22:21.302 --> 01:22:26.663
Then you said
we'll all die alone


2219
01:22:26.663 --> 01:22:36.663
Guess I'll take you home

2220
01:22:39.793 --> 01:22:44.893
And then we'll buy
ourselves a big, big house


2221
01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:50.027
To live in excess till
we squeeze one out


2222
01:22:50.027 --> 01:22:54.997
Raise 'em right way
we'll even quit the booze


2223
01:22:54.997 --> 01:23:00.961
Everyone does it,
what's there to lose


2224
01:23:00.961 --> 01:23:05.393
And you said ok

2225
01:23:06.303 --> 01:23:11.073
I mean what's there to lose

2226
01:23:11.073 --> 01:23:16.353
Then you said
we'll all die alone


2227
01:23:16.353 --> 01:23:19.923
Guess I'll take you home, girl

2228
01:23:19.923 --> 01:23:23.273
Now I'm a loser

2229
01:23:23.273 --> 01:23:28.413
I just had it with my dreaming

2230
01:23:28.413 --> 01:23:33.903
I'll write home girl
now that I'm on tour


2231
01:23:33.903 --> 01:23:40.028
And you'll ask for this to end

2232
01:23:40.028 --> 01:23:45.517
In my dreams I'm
much less focused on


2233
01:23:45.517 --> 01:23:50.507
What I'm lacking
of and who I'm not


2234
01:23:50.507 --> 01:23:55.996
I just wander 'round
I'm standing tall


2235
01:23:55.996 --> 01:24:05.976
What a life, what
a life, what a life


2236
01:24:05.976 --> 01:24:15.976
What a life to have
no cares at all


2237
01:24:29.429 --> 01:24:35.881
It's a tied score

2238
01:24:42.355 --> 01:24:45.841
Jersey with no name,
but we're partying now


2239
01:24:45.841 --> 01:24:48.331
Meet us at Waffle House

2240
01:24:48.331 --> 01:24:51.319
It's a tied score

2241
01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:53.148
Lose another day

2242
01:24:53.148 --> 01:24:56.345
It's a tied score

2243
01:24:56.345 --> 01:24:58.593
Hero of the late game

2244
01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:00.191
Tied score

2245
01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:04.653
Jersey with no name
but we're partying now


2246
01:25:04.653 --> 01:25:08.228
Meet us at Waffle House

2247
01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:10.633
It's a tied score

2248
01:25:10.633 --> 01:25:12.076
Lose another day

2249
01:25:12.076 --> 01:25:14.962
It's a tied score

2250
01:25:14.962 --> 01:25:17.013
Hero of the late game

2251
01:25:17.013 --> 01:25:18.930
Tied score

2252
01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:22.922
Jersey with no name,
but we're partying now


2253
01:25:22.922 --> 01:25:25.417
Meet us at Waffle House

2254
01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:30.028
It's a tied score

2255
01:25:45.393 --> 01:25:46.083
No way.

2256
01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:47.993
You sleep here too?

2257
01:25:47.993 --> 01:25:51.323
Fucking Shoney's guy.

2258
01:25:51.323 --> 01:25:55.593
Hey, how about you drive
me to Waffle House?


2259
01:25:55.593 --> 01:25:57.933
No?

2260
01:25:57.933 --> 01:25:59.613
All right.
