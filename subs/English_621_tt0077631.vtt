00:53:00.785 --> 00:53:01.994
I understand.

921
00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:04.246
I always thought you were
a very understanding person.


922
00:53:04.331 --> 00:53:05.539
I am.

923
00:53:05.623 --> 00:53:09.293
And I also think
that there's more to you than just fat.


924
00:53:09.627 --> 00:53:10.919
Thanks.

925
00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:12.504
You're welcome.

926
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.506
- You got a date for the dance-off?
- No.


927
00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:16.216
- Wanna go?
- Yeah.


928
00:53:16.301 --> 00:53:18.218
Oh, no, I'm gonna be a senior forever

929
00:53:18.303 --> 00:53:20.596
if I don't study
for that dumb algebra test tomorrow.


930
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.265
Hey, you're in luck, luscious.
You got an armed escort home.


931
00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:26.310
It's not the arms
I'm worried about, Sonny.


932
00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:27.936
It's the hands.

933
00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:29.521
She loves me.

934
00:53:32.192 --> 00:53:34.526
- Hey, you coming, French?
- Oh, I don't think so.


935
00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:36.653
I think I'd like to hang out
a little bit longer.


936
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.863
All right.

937
00:53:37.947 --> 00:53:40.282
I have been dieting all day long.

938
00:53:40.367 --> 00:53:42.785
My mom's apple pie
is better than this stuff.


939
00:53:42.869 --> 00:53:45.162
- Do you want a piece?
- Yeah, sure.


940
00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.539
- Hey, Putzie.
- Yeah?


941
00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:49.291
Fifteen minutes.

942
00:53:50.335 --> 00:53:52.753
You know, Danny,
I'm kind of worried about this dance-off.


943
00:53:52.837 --> 00:53:55.130
Maybe they dance differently
than we do back home.


944
00:53:55.215 --> 00:53:58.384
Don't worry about it.
Maybe we'll invent the Kangaroo Bop.


945
00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:00.135
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

946
00:54:00.512 --> 00:54:02.471
Come on, let's get out of here, Sandy.

947
00:54:02.555 --> 00:54:04.390
Zuko, see you later, okay.

948
00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:07.476
- Bye, Frenchy.
- See you, Sandy.


949
00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:13.148
Great. I get stuck
with the cheque again. Give me money.


950
00:54:14.067 --> 00:54:16.735
Okay, what is it, huh?
What's with you tonight?


951
00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.404
You've got the personality of a wet mop.

952
00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:19.655
Don't start with me.

953
00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:23.075
Oh, sure, fine. Okay, eureka.
How about I finish with you, huh?


954
00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:24.660
Finish this!

955
00:54:26.246 --> 00:54:28.205
To you from me, Pinky Lee.

956
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.042
Sorry, French.

957
00:54:32.877 --> 00:54:34.503
Rizzo!

958
00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:40.509
KENICKIE: Hey, Rizzo!
I wanna talk to you! Now!


959
00:54:42.595 --> 00:54:44.888
No use crying over spilled milkshake.

960
00:54:45.014 --> 00:54:46.932
Oh, I'll be okay.

961
00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:50.436
You know it's near closing time,
don't you?


962
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.938
Do you mind if I stay around
a little longer, Vi?


963
00:54:53.022 --> 00:54:54.773
No, suit yourself.

964
00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:57.359
- Wow.
- What?


965
00:54:57.569 --> 00:55:01.738
Well, I hate to tell you this
but your hair looks like an Easter egg.


966
00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.699
Oh, yeah.

967
00:55:03.825 --> 00:55:06.910
Well, I had a little trouble
in tinting class.


968
00:55:07.328 --> 00:55:10.831
In fact, I had a little trouble
in all my classes.


969
00:55:10.915 --> 00:55:13.750
Beauty school sure wasn't
what I thought it was gonna be.


970
00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:16.003
Oh, nothing ever is.

971
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:20.591
Vi?

972
00:55:22.051 --> 00:55:23.552
I dropped out.

973
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.138
What do you think of waitressing?

974
00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:28.348
You're too young to know.

975
00:55:29.058 --> 00:55:32.019
Hey, maybe I could be
a telephone operator.


976
00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:37.149
Nah, I don't think I would like to wear
those little things over my ears.


977
00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:42.237
God, if only I could have
a guardian angel to tell me what to do.


978
00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:45.449
You know, like Debbie Reynolds
had in Tammy


979
00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:47.242
What do you think?

980

give him my phone number.

Most mixed-up non-delinquent
on the block

Your future's so unclear now

985
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:30.494
What's left of your career now?

986
00:56:31.579 --> 00:56:34.289
Can't even get a trade in

987
00:56:35.166 --> 00:56:38.585
on your smock

988

Beauty School Dropout

989
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.774
No Graduation Day for you

Beauty School Dropout

991
00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:07.489
Missed your midterms
and flunked shampoo


992
00:57:07.615 --> 00:57:10.784
Well, at least you could have taken time

993
00:57:10.868 --> 00:57:13.829
to wash and clean your clothes up

994
00:57:13.955 --> 00:57:16.415
After spending all that dough

995
00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:19.876
to have the doctor fix your nose up

996
00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:22.004
Baby, get movin'

997
00:57:23.131 --> 00:57:26.341
Why keep your feeble hopes alive?

What are you provin'?

999

You've got the dream but not the drive

1000
00:57:33.141 --> 00:57:36.143
If you go for your diploma

1001
00:57:36.227 --> 00:57:39.062
you could join a steno pool

1002
00:57:39.188 --> 00:57:41.231
Turn in your teasing comb

1003
00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:44.359
and go back to high school

It's about time you knew the score

1008
00:58:01.836 --> 00:58:04.921
Well, they couldn't teach you anything

1009
00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:07.924
You think you're such a looker

1010
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:11.511
But no customer would go to you

1011
00:58:11.596 --> 00:58:14.681
unless she was a hooker

1012
00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.687
Baby, don't sweat it

1013
00:58:20.772 --> 00:58:22.230
Don't sweat it

1014
00:58:22.357 --> 00:58:25.484
You're not cut out to hold a job

1015
00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.527
Better forget it

1016
00:58:27.612 --> 00:58:28.904
Forget it

1017
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:32.199
Who wants their hair done by a slob?

1018
00:58:32.283 --> 00:58:35.869

your lashes twirled

01:14:14.266 --> 01:14:16.267
Come on now, shake it!

1230
01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:17.810
Yeah!

1231
01:14:18.812 --> 01:14:20.271
Twist it!

1232
01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:31.991
All right, get it!

1233
01:15:03.565 --> 01:15:10.071
How low can you go?

1234
01:15:10.197 --> 01:15:12.365
No, no, don't. Bad boy! Not here!

1235
01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:40.559
There you go!

1236
01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.438
Come on now, hand jive!

1237
01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:04.792
(WHOOPS)

1238
01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:08.963
That's the stuff!

1239
01:16:12.342 --> 01:16:13.926
Do it, baby!

1240
01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.430
Do it!

1241
01:16:27.858 --> 01:16:30.818
That's the hand jive grand jive!

1242
01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:53.048
Yeah, now let's bring it up!

1243
01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:54.967
Bring it on up!

1244
01:16:57.512 --> 01:17:00.389
Higher!

1245
01:17:00.891 --> 01:17:04.393
Higher and higher!

1246
01:17:04.978 --> 01:17:08.022
Now can you hand jive, baby?

1247
01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:11.525
Oh, can you hand jive, baby?

1248
01:17:11.902 --> 01:17:16.906
Oh, yeah

1249
01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:19.992
Born to hand jive!
Oh, yeah!


1250
01:17:20.076 --> 01:17:21.827
Oh, yeah!

1251
01:17:21.912 --> 01:17:24.246
Now let's meet them.
Here they are, the new champs.


1252
01:17:24.372 --> 01:17:26.540
Come on. Come on over here.

1253
01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:32.755
- Can I have your names, please?
- Cha Cha DiGregorio and Danny Zuko.


1254
01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:34.632
VINCE: Cha Cha and Danny,
congratulations.


1255
01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:36.091
Come on, we're gonna do it now.

1256
01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.302
- Where's Marty?
- Don't worry, she's in good hands.


1257
01:17:38.386 --> 01:17:40.429
- Whose?
- I don't know.


1258
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:45.559
Now let's see our champs
in a spotlight dance.


1259
01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:49.396
(SINGING) Blue moon

1260
01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.361
You saw me standing alone

1261
01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:56.779
(WHOOPING)

1262
01:17:58.114 --> 01:18:02.451
Without a dream in my heart

1263
01:18:04.454 --> 01:18:08.624
Without a love of my own

1264
01:18:10.126 --> 01:18:12.878
SONNY: Ready?
One, one, two, three, go.


1265
01:18:12.963 --> 01:18:14.964
Blue moon

1266
01:18:15.215 --> 01:18:16.549
(ALL LAUGHING)

1267
01:18:19.719 --> 01:18:21.595
I wonder who that is on the right?

1268
01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:25.641
We have pictures
of you so-called mooners.


1269
01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:28.352
And just because the pictures
aren't of your faces


1270
01:18:28.436 --> 01:18:30.396
doesn't mean we can't identify you.

1271
01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.483
At this very moment, those pictures
are on the way to Washington


1272
01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:39.780
where the FBI has experts
in this type of identification.


1273
01:18:39.865 --> 01:18:44.869
If you turn yourselves in now,
you may escape a federal charge.


1274
01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:10.102
SONNY: Come on, Doody,
watch your hands. Putzie, move it out.


1275
01:19:10.186 --> 01:19:12.605
I feel like a meatball in here.

1276
01:19:12.689 --> 01:19:15.357
- Okay, let's go find the chicks.
- Yeah.


1277
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.401
Marty. Marty.

1278
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:24.992
Hold my money. Don't let me
go near the refreshment stand.


1279
01:19:25.076 --> 01:19:27.161
- All right.
- I'm not hungry.


1280
01:19:27.245 --> 01:19:29.330
- I'm not hungry.
- Hey, what's happening?


1281
01:19:30.081 --> 01:19:32.166
There's nobody here.

1282
01:19:36.504 --> 01:19:39.715
Oh, come on, Sandy.
I told you on the phone that I was sorry.


1283
01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:42.968
- I know that you did.
- Well, you do believe me, don't you?


1284
01:19:43.053 --> 01:19:46.430
Well, yes, but I still think
that you and Cha Cha went together.


1285
01:19:47.223 --> 01:19:50.351
We did not go together, Sandy.
We just went together, that's all.


1286
01:19:50.435 --> 01:19:54.021
- It's the same thing.
- No. No. No.


1287
01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.126
(YELPS)

1288
01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:19.088
Oh! Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry. I...

1289
01:20:28.556 --> 01:20:29.723
Sandy,

1290
01:20:31.601 --> 01:20:33.602
would you wear my ring?

1291
01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:36.814
Oh, Danny. I don't know what to say.

1292
01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:38.899
- Say "yes."
- Yes.


1293
01:20:43.446 --> 01:20:46.156
Oh, Danny, this means so much to me,

1294
01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.617
'cause I know now that you respect me.

1295
01:20:56.584 --> 01:20:57.918
Hey, Rizz?

1296
01:20:58.003 --> 01:20:59.336
Watch it.

1297
01:21:00.588 --> 01:21:03.841
- What is with you tonight?
- I feel like a defective typewriter.


1298
01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.968
- Huh?
- I skipped a period.


1299
01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:08.512
- You think you're PG?
- I don't know. Big deal.


1300
01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:11.473
- Well, was it Kenickie?
- Nah, you don't know the guy.


1301
01:21:11.599 --> 01:21:14.143
Well, hey, Rizz, look...
Look, Rizz, it's okay.


1302
01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:17.730
I caught Vince Fontaine trying to put
aspirin in my Coke at the dance.


1303
01:21:17.814 --> 01:21:21.108
Hey. Marty, you ain't gonna tell
nobody about this, right?


1304
01:21:21.192 --> 01:21:23.944
Oh, sure, Rizz.
Look, I'll take it to the grave, okay?


1305
01:21:27.615 --> 01:21:31.160
Coming through, coming through.
Come on, lady with a baby.


1306
01:21:34.664 --> 01:21:36.707
Hey, Marty, what's up?

1307
01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:39.168
Rizzo's pregnant. 
Don't tell anybody.

1308
01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.258
Hey, Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.

1309
01:21:57.729 --> 01:21:59.563
Rizzo's knocked up.

1310
01:22:03.526 --> 01:22:05.861
Rizzo, I hear you're knocked up.

1311
01:22:05.945 --> 01:22:07.112
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.


1312
01:22:07.197 --> 01:22:09.281
Boy, good news really travels fast.

1313
01:22:10.033 --> 01:22:12.117
Why didn't you tell me about it?

1314
01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.078
What's it to you?

1315
01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:16.413
I thought I might be able
to do something.


1316
01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:18.123
You did enough.

1317
01:22:19.542 --> 01:22:22.086
I don't run away from my mistakes.

1318
01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:26.340
Hey, don't worry about it, Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.


1319
01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:34.098
Thanks a lot, kid.

1320
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:36.725
Anytime.

1321
01:22:43.775 --> 01:22:46.985
- Oh, I hope you're not getting a cold.
- Oh, no. No.


1322
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:50.072
It's just probably
a little drive-in dust, that's all.


1323
01:23:02.335 --> 01:23:04.545
- Danny!
- Sandy! Oh, Sandy.


1324
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:07.047
- Danny, what are you doing?
- Oh, Sandy.


1325
01:23:07.132 --> 01:23:08.841
Don't worry about it, nobody's watching.

1326
01:23:08.925 --> 01:23:10.634
Danny, get off me!

1327
01:23:11.094 --> 01:23:15.055
Sandy, what's the matter with you?
I thought I meant something to you.


1328
01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.557
Meant something to you?

1329
01:23:16.641 --> 01:23:19.601
You think I'm gonna stay here
with you in this sin wagon?


1330
01:23:19.686 --> 01:23:21.979
You can take this piece of tin!

1331
01:23:22.647 --> 01:23:25.649
Sandy, you just can't
walk out of a drive-in!


1332
01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.744
(SINGING) Stranded at the drive-in

1333
01:23:39.038 --> 01:23:42.374
Branded a fool

1334
01:23:43.168 --> 01:23:46.044
What will they say

1335
01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:50.007
Monday at school?

1336
01:23:57.515 --> 01:24:01.768
Sandy, can't you see

1337
01:24:01.853 --> 01:24:04.730
I'm in misery?

1338
01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:07.983
We made a start

1339
01:24:08.067 --> 01:24:10.319
Now we're apart

1340
01:24:10.403 --> 01:24:13.655
There's nothin' left for me

1341
01:24:14.866 --> 01:24:17.117
Love has flown

1342
01:24:17.202 --> 01:24:22.372
All alone I sit and wonder why-yi-yi-yi

1343
01:24:23.833 --> 01:24:27.211
Why you left me

1344
01:24:27.795 --> 01:24:33.425
Oh, Sandy

1345
01:24:33.509 --> 01:24:37.512
Baby, someday

1346
01:24:37.597 --> 01:24:40.933
when high school is done

1347
01:24:42.393 --> 01:24:46.355
Somehow, some way

1348
01:24:46.439 --> 01:24:49.650
our two worlds will be one

1349
01:24:50.944 --> 01:24:55.113
In heaven forever

1350
01:24:55.198 --> 01:24:58.659
and ever we will be

1351
01:24:59.535 --> 01:25:02.871
Oh, please, say you'll stay

1352
01:25:03.915 --> 01:25:06.208
Oh, Sandy

1353
01:25:09.712 --> 01:25:11.964
Sandy, my darling

1354
01:25:12.632 --> 01:25:14.716
you hurt me real bad

1355
01:25:15.551 --> 01:25:17.302
You know it's true

1356
01:25:18.471 --> 01:25:21.515
But, baby, you gotta believe me
when I say


1357
01:25:23.142 --> 01:25:25.227
I'm helpless without you

1358
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:28.397
Love has flown

1359
01:25:28.481 --> 01:25:33.610
All alone I sit, 
I wonder why-yi-yi-yi

1360
01:25:34.779 --> 01:25:38.365
Oh, why you left me

1361
01:25:39.117 --> 01:25:41.618
Oh, Sandy

1362
01:25:43.997 --> 01:25:50.544
Sandy

1363
01:25:54.757 --> 01:25:58.885
Why-yi-yi-yi?

1364
01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:01.930
Oh, Sandy!

1365
01:26:06.686 --> 01:26:08.437
Head it out. Come on, guys.

1366
01:26:08.521 --> 01:26:10.939
All right, pull out! Pull out! Pull out!

1367
01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:18.405
Well, the crate shaped up.

1368
01:26:18.489 --> 01:26:20.449
And it's as hot
as the parts on it.

1369
01:26:20.533 --> 01:26:22.701
Hey, we didn't steal all of it.
Some of it was donated.


1370
01:26:22.827 --> 01:26:25.454
Yeah, this baby's gonna knock them
on their ears at Thunder Road.


1371
01:26:25.538 --> 01:26:27.914
You're right.
You could still change your mind.


1372
01:26:27.999 --> 01:26:31.335
- The flag goes down in three hours.
- And Greased Lightning strikes.


1373
01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.919
Hey, Mrs. Murdock, you coming?

1374
01:26:33.004 --> 01:26:36.214
I don't expect my boys to let me down,
and I won't let them down.


1375
01:26:36.299 --> 01:26:38.592
- That's the way!
- Way to go, Murdock!


1376
01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.303
I wanna talk to you.

1377
01:26:43.639 --> 01:26:46.475
Hey, look, those guys at Thunder Road,
they don't fool around.


1378
01:26:46.559 --> 01:26:48.185
You know that, right?

1379
01:26:48.853 --> 01:26:50.854
You want me to punk out?

1380
01:26:50.938 --> 01:26:53.857
No, I'm not saying punking out,
but I'm just...


1381
01:26:54.942 --> 01:26:56.943
You know what I mean. I...

1382
01:26:58.237 --> 01:27:02.741
