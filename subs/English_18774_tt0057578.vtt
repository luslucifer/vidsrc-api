1
00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:02.317
Come on England, come on...

2
00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.347
Come on, lads get
some weight into it!


3
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.268
Come on get stuck in.

4
00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:12.804
Come on. Come on over here.

5
00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:23.816
Bloody hell!

6
00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:25.984
He's broke his front teeth.

7
00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:31.364
You won't want to see
no tarts for a week.


8
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:01.604
How is he?

9
00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:03.273
He's just a bit dazed.

10
00:04:03.373 --> 00:04:04.983
He'll be alright though.

11
00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:06.401
It's not to bad.

12
00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:08.735
How do you feel?

13
00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:16.201
You ought to charge more rent.

14
00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:20.829
I don't mind telling you Mrs Hammond.

15
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.085
But when I first came here
I thought I'd fallen easy.


16
00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:26.504
I don't want a list
of my shortcomings.


17
00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:29.881
I'm only trying to show you where
you're hurting yourself most.


18
00:04:30.024 --> 00:04:32.719
Can't I talk to you just
for once as a person.


19
00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.389
If you listen to what I have to say.
I could really put you right.


20
00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:38.808
I wish you wouldn't try
and work me into a fit.


21
00:04:38.908 --> 00:04:41.769
I've asked you before to
leave me alone, that way.


22
00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:44.187
I can't stand it.

23
00:04:50.753 --> 00:04:52.946
How do you feel, Frank?

24
00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:57.867
You won't be able to shoot your
mouth off like you used to...


25
00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.413
at least not for a few days.

26
00:05:00.513 --> 00:05:02.707
Can you fix me up with a dentist?

27
00:05:02.807 --> 00:05:05.583
I donâ€™t know.
It's Christmas you know, Frank.


28
00:05:05.893 --> 00:05:07.877
I want it tonight.

29
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.547
Well, I... I can try.

30
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.469
Tonight!

31
00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.303
Come on, you lot, let's have you out!

32
00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:32.195
How do I look?

33
00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:35.822
I've seen worse. 
Go on, you're dry.

34
00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:40.036
You going to Weaver's
party tonight, Frank?


35
00:05:40.136 --> 00:05:41.913
I've been counting on it.

36
00:05:42.013 --> 00:05:44.123
I'd leave well alone if I were you.

37
00:05:44.223 --> 00:05:45.958
Weaver and parties.

38
00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:49.085
I'd get your mouth seen to
first it's more important.


39
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.963
How's your Mrs Hammond?

40
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.674
She's alright.

41
00:05:56.736 --> 00:05:59.470
I bought some presents for her kids.

42
00:05:59.864 --> 00:06:02.098
Bet she won't like it though.

43
00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:05.393
She doesn't like me interfering.

44
00:06:09.624 --> 00:06:11.192
Hallo Frank.

45
00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:14.028
- How are you lad?
- Not now Johnson we're in a hurry.


46
00:06:14.128 --> 00:06:16.280
- Oh Mr Weaver.
- Yes George.


47
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.741
- Frank's ready whenever you want him.
- Oh good.


48
00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:20.243
How's it going Frank?

49
00:06:20.343 --> 00:06:21.869
I'm alright.

50
00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.205
Hello Maurice. What are
you coming in the car too.


51
00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:28.084
Oh I wouldn't miss seeing Frank in
the chair. I might even get a camera.


52
00:06:31.312 --> 00:06:33.756
You can put your little
doggie in the boot, George.


53
00:06:33.856 --> 00:06:36.090
Right
-Oh, Mr Weaver.

54
00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:42.263
What about your little dog, Frank?

55
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.853
Go on in, Dad.

56
00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:53.983
That's not very funny.

57
00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:01.701
Let's have a look at you then.

58
00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:04.328
It's not me, old lad it's Frank here.

59
00:07:04.428 --> 00:07:07.618
Right. Come on.
I've a Member's Ticket,


60
00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.933
that'll be how you traced me.
I haven't seen a match this season.


61
00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:14.754
Sit yourself down.

62
00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:30.855
It's a mess.
They'll have to come out.


63
00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:32.440
Six of them.

64
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.317
It's all I can do.

65
00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:37.403
Well, hasn't Weaver
arranged to pay you?


66
00:07:37.503 --> 00:07:39.697
Oh, that's not the point,
I'm afraid. He'll need a plate.


67
00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:41.532
What of it?

68
00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:44.202
I can't go making plates for him.
This is a Children's Department.


69
00:07:44.302 --> 00:07:46.329
Well, kids have false teeth.
I know a couple who have.


70
00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:48.681
- Do you?
- All right, you do the pulling,


71
00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:51.292
get your mate to do the plate.
We'll pay, never mind Weaver.


72
00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:53.961
It's no party here,
let's get on with it.


73
00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:56.464
Aye, you see, he's in pain.

74
00:07:56.564 --> 00:07:57.840
It'll be ten guineas.

75
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.634
- Ten guineas?
- Take it or leave it.


76
00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:03.219
Come on, whatever the bloody price.

77
00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:07.058
It'll have to be gas.

78
00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:09.519
Have you eaten recently?

79
00:08:09.619 --> 00:08:11.646
No, not since my dinner.

80
00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:14.065
Well, would you mind waiting outside?

81
00:08:14.165 --> 00:08:16.566
Go on, Maurice.

82
00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:29.829
Right.

83
00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:33.166
Could you put your hands
in your pockets?...


84
00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:37.336
That's it.

85
00:08:37.563 --> 00:08:40.048
Sit tight. You'll feel nothing.

86
00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.383
Breathe deeply.

87
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.387
Sit tight.

88
00:08:44.487 --> 00:08:47.305
Keep your hands in your pockets.

89
00:08:48.282 --> 00:08:50.224
You'll feel nothing.

90
00:08:55.998 --> 00:08:58.109
I've been thinking...

91
00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:00.485
why don't we go for a walk?

92
00:09:01.796 --> 00:09:03.905
What on earth for?

93
00:09:07.843 --> 00:09:11.412
What do you want us to go walking
about in the bloody pitch dark for?


94
00:09:11.972 --> 00:09:14.625
Well, I like to talk to
someone when I'm walking.


95
00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:17.752
You know, your problems;
they're sort of...


96
00:09:18.562 --> 00:09:20.838
You've plenty of friends.

97
00:09:23.442 --> 00:09:25.843
Here, look at this funny man.

98
00:09:26.654 --> 00:09:28.888
Here, you play with it.

99
00:09:31.617 --> 00:09:35.353
You must be mad to think I'd
go out there, walking with you.


100
00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:39.942
I don't want you poking
your nose into my affairs.


101
00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:42.653
You won't find me poking
my nose into yours.


102
00:09:42.753 --> 00:09:45.239
I have some pride left,
if you didn't know.


103
00:09:45.339 --> 00:09:47.533
Don't you want to be happy?

104
00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:49.744
If I'm left alone, I am happy.

105
00:09:49.844 --> 00:09:51.621
I don't need you pushing in.

106
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:53.623
I'm not pushing in!

107
00:09:53.723 --> 00:09:56.042
I'm just trying to be friendly.

108
00:09:56.142 --> 00:09:58.048
Well, I'm not going about all
day with a grin over my face


109
00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:01.631
- just to make you think I'm happy.
- I don't mean laughing all the time.


110
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:04.757
I mean, you just don't look happy.

111
00:10:04.984 --> 00:10:07.303
It's not a... not a question
of laughing all the time...


112
00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:08.971
You make me sick!

113
00:10:09.071 --> 00:10:12.558
All right, I am sick. I'm bloody
sick of living here, an' all!


114
00:10:12.658 --> 00:10:15.811
Mr Machin,
that's easily settled... don't.


115
00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:19.105
Just stop living here.
We'll be better off without you.


116
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:37.290
Come on, open up!

117
00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:39.418
- What have you got in there.
- Come on!


118
00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:41.919
Come on, open up, you boss-eyed git!

119
00:10:56.535 --> 00:10:58.312
Oi, you and me.

120
00:10:58.412 --> 00:11:01.063
Catch it, Dad.

121
00:11:03.334 --> 00:11:05.986
Come on, open up!
The Manager's expecting us.


122
00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:07.363
Come on, Jeff.

123
00:11:07.463 --> 00:11:08.781
Come on, open up!

124
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:10.781
Jeff, come on.

125
00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:21.125
Excuse me.

126
00:11:21.894 --> 00:11:24.003
I'm with players.

127
00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:26.590
I'm with players!

128
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.218
I'm sorry, Mr Johnson,
didn't know it was you. Come on in.


129
00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:39.395
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
comes the big moment of the evening.


130
00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:43.023
The winners in tonight's fifty-pounds
Freestyle Dance Contest:


131
00:11:43.123 --> 00:11:46.567
Miss Evie Turner and
Mr John Whittaker.


132
00:11:56.929 --> 00:11:58.532
As you may have noticed,
ladies and gentlemen,


133
00:11:58.633 --> 00:12:01.459
we've just been joined by a
party from another winning team


134
00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:05.544
of whom we're all very proud...
our City Rugby League Team!


135
00:12:13.863 --> 00:12:15.888
Come on, the City!

136
00:12:16.323 --> 00:12:18.975
And now, I'm going to ask a
couple of these famous men


137
00:12:19.076 --> 00:12:22.313
to kindly step up here and present
the winners with their prizes.


138
00:12:22.413 --> 00:12:24.565
Len Miller and Maurice Braithwaite!

139
00:12:24.665 --> 00:12:26.776
Come on, Len, come on, Maurice.

140
00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:29.278
Just wait 'till I've
finished this half.


141
00:12:29.378 --> 00:12:31.946
Come on, Len!

142
00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:43.918
Ladies and Gentlemen: Len Miller,
Captain of the City, and Maurice Braithwaite.


143
00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:45.793
How do.

144
00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:06.355
Well, thank you, Len,
thank you, Maurice.


145
00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:10.528
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

146
00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:15.156
it's on with the dance. It's a general
Excuse Me, and may the best man win!


147
00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:52.653
Excuse me.

148
00:13:52.753 --> 00:13:54.612
Got this one.

149
00:13:55.589 --> 00:13:58.115
He just called a general Excuse Me.

150
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.163
Do you want a thumping, love?

151
00:14:05.975 --> 00:14:07.875
Aye.

152
00:14:09.144 --> 00:14:11.545
Well, you'd better come
outside and Excuse Me there.


153
00:14:25.202 --> 00:14:26.520
Hold on a minute.

154
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.229
Hold on!

155
00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:33.025
You...

156
00:14:35.546 --> 00:14:38.155
Now, what's it all about, then?

157
00:15:42.571 --> 00:15:44.181
I was meaning to ask you.

158
00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:45.766
Well, what's that?

159
00:15:45.866 --> 00:15:47.851
Your name is Johnson, isn't it?

160
00:15:47.951 --> 00:15:50.311
Aye, that's right.

161
00:15:51.538 --> 00:15:53.732
You're a scout for the City.

162
00:15:53.832 --> 00:15:56.233
You could say so.

163
00:15:59.338 --> 00:16:01.572
Can you get me a trial?

164
00:16:04.676 --> 00:16:06.494
Aah!

165
00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:10.873
Now, wait! Wait a minute, lad.

166
00:16:29.701 --> 00:16:31.812
Why don't you come and see me play?

167
00:16:31.912 --> 00:16:33.939
I need someone to cheer me.

168
00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:35.983
You can cheer yourself.

169
00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:38.736
You won't catch me up there
freezing to death for an hour.


170
00:16:38.836 --> 00:16:41.280
It's my first game;
a lot depends on it.


171
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.572
- You don't have to do it.
- It's a job.


172
00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:46.869
If I play well and they sign me,
I might get three or four hundred quid.


173
00:16:46.969 --> 00:16:48.996
I'm sure they'll give you all that.

174
00:16:49.096 --> 00:16:51.956
Well, that's just the sort
of encouragement I need.


175
00:16:53.684 --> 00:16:56.418
Come and see, I'd like you to come.

176
00:16:56.854 --> 00:16:59.840
If I wanted to go
I would; I've said it.


177
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.550
I don't want to.

178
00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:02.760
Wish us luck, then.

179
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.969
All that's coming your way.

180
00:17:05.487 --> 00:17:07.306
I don't wish you my luck.

181
00:17:07.406 --> 00:17:09.890
I'll have to make do with
my own, then, won't I?


182
00:17:32.764 --> 00:17:34.500
That's it, Frank!

183
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.875
Well done, lad!

184
00:17:42.649 --> 00:17:43.926
What's his name, Wade?

185
00:17:44.026 --> 00:17:46.427
Er... Machin. Er, Frank Machin.

186
00:17:47.738 --> 00:17:49.515
Oh, Charles is here.

187
00:17:49.615 --> 00:17:50.891
Hallo, Charles.

188
00:17:50.991 --> 00:17:53.058
- Charles.
- Gerald.


189
00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:01.985
Pass the ball, Gower.

190
00:18:02.085 --> 00:18:04.236
Pass the bloody ball, you nit!

191
00:18:06.632 --> 00:18:08.741
Pass the ball, you git!

192
00:18:11.637 --> 00:18:14.164
Come on, Gower, get after it!

193
00:18:14.264 --> 00:18:16.500
Let's have that bloody
ball in future, you nut!


194
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.334
Get stuffed.

195
00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:44.069
Come on, Gower,
get rid of that bloody ball!


196
00:18:44.169 --> 00:18:46.737
- Come on, Gower!
- Pass the ball, man!


197
00:18:54.972 --> 00:18:56.997
Bloody hell!

198
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.334
Hey, Gower, what're you
playing at, you bloody frog?


199
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.391
Trainer, trainer!

200
00:19:16.994 --> 00:19:19.228
Come here. What's your name?

201
00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:21.106
How do you mean, Ref? 
I didn't do it.

202
00:19:21.206 --> 00:19:23.609
- I never touched him.
- You can tell that to Rugby League Chairman.


203
00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.069
Look, I swear to God,
I never touched him.


204
00:19:26.169 --> 00:19:28.363
Look at my bloody fists,
there's no blood on them!


205
00:19:28.463 --> 00:19:30.157
- Go on, get off! Off!
- Takes some beating...


206
00:19:30.257 --> 00:19:31.700
bloody hell!

207
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.077
He's not fit to be
on a football field.


208
00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:35.744
Aye.

209
00:19:37.764 --> 00:19:40.040
Don't come back here again!

210
00:19:43.228 --> 00:19:45.005
They got the wrong man there.

211
00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:46.840
You think so, Mr Slomer?

212
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.050
Of course. It's as plain
as the nose on your face.


213
00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:52.179
That's not what I call football.

214
00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:54.514
It's a rough game, Charles.

215
00:19:54.614 --> 00:19:58.225
Personally, I like to see a man
playing as if he really meant it.


216
00:21:07.604 --> 00:21:09.798
You played a blinder,
Frank! You played a blinder.


217
00:21:09.898 --> 00:21:11.258
You enjoyed it?

218
00:21:11.358 --> 00:21:13.552
Come on, lad,
they'll be all over you.


219
00:21:13.652 --> 00:21:15.846
I was sitting right int'
middle of Committee.


220
00:21:15.946 --> 00:21:18.849
Don't get excited, Dad.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.


221
00:21:18.949 --> 00:21:20.267
What are you having?

222
00:21:20.367 --> 00:21:22.100
I'll have a beer.

223
00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:25.521
Two beers, please.

224
00:21:25.872 --> 00:21:28.317
You won't find them no
different from me, lad.


225
00:21:28.417 --> 00:21:32.154
Maybe they won't show it.
Naturally, they... they shot it like me.


226
00:21:32.254 --> 00:21:33.572
Allow me.

227
00:21:33.672 --> 00:21:36.365
- What?
- No, allow me. I really do insist.


228
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.617
A double, Bob.

229
00:21:41.054 --> 00:21:42.914
Well, you played a
good game today, Frank.


230
00:21:43.014 --> 00:21:45.167
Aye, he played a blinder.

231
00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:47.544
I wouldn't worry about him,
he's a bit soft.


232
00:21:47.644 --> 00:21:49.463
How'd you like the City?

233
00:21:49.563 --> 00:21:51.298
I'm getting the hang of it.

234
00:21:51.398 --> 00:21:53.674
Yes, I rather gathered that.

235
00:21:54.192 --> 00:21:56.011
Pity about Taffy Gower.

236
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:57.471
What about him?

237
00:21:57.571 --> 00:21:59.765
They've taken him to hospital.

238
00:21:59.865 --> 00:22:02.349
I believe it was a broken nose.

239
00:22:03.118 --> 00:22:06.271
You know, for a little fellow
their hooker packs quite a punch.


240
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:08.647
It's bad luck.

241
00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:12.568
Yes, it is.

242
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:16.947
You haven't signed on here?

243
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.701
No, they haven't made
their minds up yet.


244
00:22:21.261 --> 00:22:24.206
Well, I don't think they'll
find that too difficult...


245
00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:26.248
do you?

246
00:22:28.101 --> 00:22:29.918
Goodbye, Frank.

247
00:22:34.191 --> 00:22:36.300
Who was it?

248
00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:38.011
You know, Frank.

249
00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:40.470
Who was it, Dad?

250
00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:44.474
Guess... Go on, have a guess.

251
00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:46.520
Who was it?

252
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.021
That's mean, Frank.

253
00:22:48.121 --> 00:22:49.356
That's mean.

254
00:22:49.456 --> 00:22:50.774
Who was it, Dad?

255
00:22:50.874 --> 00:22:52.566
That's mean.

256
00:22:56.379 --> 00:22:59.072
Why did you squeeze
my wrist like that?


257
00:23:00.884 --> 00:23:02.244
I don't know.

258
00:23:02.344 --> 00:23:03.620
Why?

259
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.455
Was it Weaver?

260
00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:07.416
You hurt me, you know.

261
00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:09.541
Just because it was Weaver.

262
00:23:11.102 --> 00:23:13.795
You get far too excited, lad.

263
00:23:14.189 --> 00:23:16.465
I thought you knew it was Weaver.

264
00:23:17.275 --> 00:23:19.052
I was surprised,
him talking to me like that.


265
00:23:19.152 --> 00:23:21.346
He must have been impressed.

266
00:23:21.446 --> 00:23:23.555
Do you think there's something?

267
00:23:24.407 --> 00:23:25.849
Aye.

268
00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:09.851
Do you want me
to come home with you?

269
00:24:10.704 --> 00:24:14.314
It's no trouble... no trouble to me.

270
00:24:16.001 --> 00:24:17.567
Aye.

271
00:24:18.878 --> 00:24:23.115
Aye. Come if you like. Have some tea.
Mrs Hammond won't mind.


272
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.433
Bit of a coincidence,
me knowing her husband.


273
00:24:50.535 --> 00:24:52.019
Yep.

274
00:24:52.996 --> 00:24:56.898
Not that well, mind;
maybe only a year afore he died.


275
00:25:08.053 --> 00:25:11.122
I say, them's not his
boots, are they?


276
00:25:11.222 --> 00:25:13.790
What's she keep 'em for?

277
00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:15.584
I don't know.

278
00:25:21.816 --> 00:25:24.259
How long have you lived here, Frank?

279
00:25:24.944 --> 00:25:27.387
Oh, about five or six months.

280
00:25:29.115 --> 00:25:30.559
She had some kids, didn't she?

281
00:25:30.659 --> 00:25:33.310
- Aye.
- How does she manage?


282
00:25:34.245 --> 00:25:35.689
She does all right...

283
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:37.566
she does all right.

284
00:25:37.666 --> 00:25:39.357
She just...

285
00:25:39.751 --> 00:25:42.402
put up the shutters
and stopped living.


286
00:25:43.922 --> 00:25:46.198
My wife left me ten year ago.

287
00:25:58.186 --> 00:26:00.337
Isn't it warm, Mum?

288
00:26:02.107 --> 00:26:03.840
Warm...?

289
00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:07.095
You know we can't use
all that coal, Mr Machin.


290
00:26:07.195 --> 00:26:09.679
Don't worry, I'll fetch you
a load home from t' pit.


291
00:26:10.907 --> 00:26:13.225
Mr Johnson, this is Mrs Hammond...

292
00:26:13.493 --> 00:26:15.645
Ian, and Lynda.

293
00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:17.564
We haven't much in for tea.

294
00:26:17.664 --> 00:26:19.107
Don't boast about it.

295
00:26:19.207 --> 00:26:22.067
Mr Johnson might get
the idea we're poor.


296
00:26:25.547 --> 00:26:27.157
You sit down.

297
00:26:27.257 --> 00:26:30.368
All right, there, young love?
Ooh, you're getting very heavy!


298
00:26:30.468 --> 00:26:32.410
I know!

299
00:26:32.804 --> 00:26:34.456
Tell me...

300
00:26:34.556 --> 00:26:36.124
what have you been doing?

301
00:26:36.224 --> 00:26:38.168
Been out shopping with me mam.

302
00:26:38.268 --> 00:26:39.919
Have you now.
And where else did you go?


303
00:26:40.019 --> 00:26:42.337
We went to see our dad.

304
00:26:46.484 --> 00:26:48.094
How did the match go?

305
00:26:48.194 --> 00:26:49.471
Did you win?

306
00:26:49.571 --> 00:26:52.472
He played a blinder, Missus,
he played a blinder.


307
00:26:53.408 --> 00:26:55.308
Oh. Did he?

308
00:26:55.535 --> 00:26:57.062
And have they signed him on?

309
00:26:57.162 --> 00:26:58.647
Nay, it's not as quick as that.

310
00:26:58.747 --> 00:27:01.900
But after today's match he'll be
able to ask anything he likes.


311
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.693
Isn't that right, Frank?

312
00:27:03.793 --> 00:27:05.737
Frank, isn't that right?

313
00:27:05.837 --> 00:27:07.197
I don't know!

314
00:27:07.297 --> 00:27:09.574
Aye, it won't pay them to
turn you down, you know, lad.


315
00:27:09.674 --> 00:27:11.159
I'm sure they'll give
him it, Mr Johnson.


316
00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:13.328
Aye, he'll sail away.

317
00:27:13.428 --> 00:27:15.413
He'll sail away.

318
00:27:15.513 --> 00:27:17.831
You'll be very pleased.

319
00:27:19.476 --> 00:27:21.670
I'll see you then, Dad.

320
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.504
You don't mind me helping you,
do you, Frank?


321
00:27:26.816 --> 00:27:28.468
Why do you say that?

322
00:27:28.568 --> 00:27:32.637
Well, you know... I, I mean... if I'm in
a position to help, I think it's only right.


323
00:27:32.906 --> 00:27:35.392
Aye... I think it's right.

324
00:27:35.492 --> 00:27:36.601
You don't mind?

325
00:27:36.701 --> 00:27:39.354
No.

326
00:27:39.454 --> 00:27:41.564
Don't know what you're talking about!

327
00:27:41.664 --> 00:27:43.400
Oh... well, that's all right, then.

328
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.693
I'll see you.

329
00:27:44.793 --> 00:27:47.694
You know, any... any time at all.

330
00:27:47.921 --> 00:27:49.863
Aye, see you, Dad.

331
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.085
You play for nothing, then?

332
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.173
I get amateur pay... thirty bob.

333
00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:09.299
That's hardly a wage.

334
00:28:09.526 --> 00:28:12.010
Well, they pay you good money
when they sign you on.


335
00:28:21.246 --> 00:28:24.022
The old man treats you like a son.

336
00:28:24.749 --> 00:28:27.652
I... wouldn't say that. I call
him 'Dad' because he's old.


337
00:28:27.752 --> 00:28:29.279
I don't mean that.

338
00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:31.364
- What do you mean?
- The way he treats you.


339
00:28:31.464 --> 00:28:33.241
The way he ogles you.

340
00:28:33.341 --> 00:28:35.368
He looks at you like a girl.

341
00:28:35.468 --> 00:28:37.287
Now, don't come with that.

342
00:28:37.387 --> 00:28:38.997
He's interested, that's all.

343
00:28:39.097 --> 00:28:40.331
I'd say excited.

344
00:28:40.431 --> 00:28:42.792
Well, excited, then!
What are you getting on about?


345
00:28:42.892 --> 00:28:45.253
He hasn't got much to get
excited about at his age.


346
00:28:45.353 --> 00:28:46.629
He's done a lot for me.

347
00:28:46.729 --> 00:28:48.173
He's never had a job
of work in his life.


348
00:28:48.273 --> 00:28:49.758
How do you know he's never worked?

349
00:28:49.858 --> 00:28:51.384
Because I've got eyes.

350
00:28:51.484 --> 00:28:53.178
You just look at his hands.

351
00:28:53.278 --> 00:28:55.804
He's got awful hands,
they're all soft.


352
00:28:57.073 --> 00:28:59.641
What have hands got to do with it?

353
00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.980
He's got awful hands...
I've got awful hands.


354
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.439
We're not all women.

355
00:29:06.583 --> 00:29:08.775
Well, it's nothing to do with me.

356
00:30:02.305 --> 00:30:03.957
Your husband...

357
00:30:04.057 --> 00:30:07.167
I gather he worked at
Weavers Engineering?


358
00:30:08.102 --> 00:30:10.003
Who told you that?

359
00:30:11.314 --> 00:30:12.549
Johnson.

360
00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:14.924
Said he used to know him.

361
00:30:17.028 --> 00:30:19.346
He must have told you something else.

362
00:30:20.823 --> 00:30:22.474
No.

363
00:30:24.452 --> 00:30:30.273
I expect he thought it was very... chivalrous
of you, helping a widow, and all that...


364
00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:34.444
You reckon it's nothing...
to you what people think.


365
00:30:35.463 --> 00:30:37.530
It isn't.

366
00:30:38.424 --> 00:30:41.326
It's bringing Eric's name
into it I don't like.


367
00:30:49.185 --> 00:30:51.503
You see, when Eric died...

368
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.048
well, all my world went out.

369
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.345
He used say he didn't
know why he was living.


370
00:31:02.782 --> 00:31:04.808
He used to say:

371
00:31:05.368 --> 00:31:07.685
'How was I ever made alive?'

372
00:31:10.456 --> 00:31:13.608
When he went like that, I felt
I hadn't been proper to him.


373
00:31:15.795 --> 00:31:18.571
I hadn't made him feel
as if he belonged.


374
00:31:30.852 --> 00:31:33.253
I shouldn't be telling
you this, should I?


375
00:31:39.777 --> 00:31:41.888
I... I don't mind.

376
00:31:41.988 --> 00:31:43.847
No...

377
00:31:44.032 --> 00:31:46.891
I mean, you being what you are.

378
00:31:47.118 --> 00:31:51.271
Self-reliant; all that cockiness.

379
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:56.985
You don't seem worried like Eric was.

380
00:31:57.503 --> 00:31:59.446
I...

381
00:32:01.424 --> 00:32:04.075
I only mentioned it because...

382
00:32:04.802 --> 00:32:07.370
well, because I saw you
polishing them boots.


383
00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:10.957
Is there anything the matter
with me cleaning them?


384
00:32:11.768 --> 00:32:13.544
No...

385
00:32:13.644 --> 00:32:15.797
No... like I said...

386
00:32:15.897 --> 00:32:17.755
I don't mind.

387
00:33:24.632 --> 00:33:26.866
A thousand pounds.

388
00:33:27.009 --> 00:33:30.955
A thousand?

389
00:33:31.055 --> 00:33:34.332
That's a very large sum for a
player just entering the game.


390
00:33:35.268 --> 00:33:37.877
I want one thousand down.

391
00:33:39.355 --> 00:33:43.951
Now, look here, Frank... we're not providing
a comprehensive insurance policy.


392
00:33:44.052 --> 00:33:46.769
That's a very fair
offer Mr Riley's made.


393
00:33:50.324 --> 00:33:53.393
I want a thousand pounds... down.

394
00:33:55.413 --> 00:33:58.149
Now, look, we're not trying to
put anything over on to you.


395
00:33:58.249 --> 00:34:01.870
I wish you'd get that into your head.
But we are representing other people,


396
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:04.906
we're responsible for investing
their money soundly.


397
00:34:05.006 --> 00:34:08.825
I can't change my mind.
I feel I'm worth it.


398
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.496
What does Mr Slomer think?

399
00:34:14.473 --> 00:34:18.044
My only surprise is that you're
discussing such a figure at all.


400
00:34:18.144 --> 00:34:20.046
What figure would you suggest?

401
00:34:20.146 --> 00:34:23.591
I'm far from convinced that he's the
kind of player we want, in the first place.


402
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:26.719
You realise,
as I'm sure Frank does...


403
00:34:26.819 --> 00:34:29.470
that we're not the only
club that's interested?


404
00:34:29.614 --> 00:34:33.391
We're not here to worry about other clubs.
We're here to decide whether we want him.


405
00:34:34.702 --> 00:34:36.978
Well, you've had my opinion.

406
00:34:38.497 --> 00:34:41.399
Frank, could you wait
outside a minute?


407
00:35:02.313 --> 00:35:04.797
How goes it, Frank?

408
00:35:05.441 --> 00:35:07.635
Have they fixed you up?

409
00:35:07.735 --> 00:35:09.762
They're talking about it now.

410
00:35:09.862 --> 00:35:12.223
Let me get you a drink.
Whiskey? Whiskey, Bob.


411
00:35:12.323 --> 00:35:15.058
I'm Phillips, from the City Guardian.

412
00:35:15.368 --> 00:35:17.894
You needn't take it seriously.

413
00:35:19.038 --> 00:35:20.356
Why not?

414
00:35:20.456 --> 00:35:22.608
It's only a game, old sport.
It's all a game...


415
00:35:22.708 --> 00:35:24.525
for Weaver's benefit.

416
00:35:26.003 --> 00:35:27.989
You mean, they act like
that just for Weaver?


417
00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:30.783
Well, it's his cash they're
dishing out. His or Slomer's.


418
00:35:30.883 --> 00:35:34.202
If Slomer hates your guts,
Weaver 'll buy you out of spite.


419
00:35:34.637 --> 00:35:36.788
I see you've got a bruise coming.

420
00:35:36.973 --> 00:35:41.125
No, Weaver wouldn't have you up
here just to say ta-ta, you know.


421
00:35:41.269 --> 00:35:43.211
Frank.

422
00:35:57.493 --> 00:36:00.603
What do you aim to do,
Frank, if we don't sign you?


423
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:03.690
Don't know.

424
00:36:03.874 --> 00:36:05.610
Carry on as I am.

425
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.362
Can't you change your mind
about splitting the payment?


426
00:36:21.892 --> 00:36:23.544
No.

427
00:36:23.644 --> 00:36:25.463
No, one thousand down.

428
00:36:25.563 --> 00:36:28.423
Well, I'm afraid there's
nothing else for it, then.


429
00:36:28.733 --> 00:36:30.384
You're not going to sign me?

430
00:36:30.484 --> 00:36:31.761
That's it.

431
00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:33.554
We'll have to.

432
00:36:33.654 --> 00:36:36.097
Congratulations, Frank.

433
00:36:40.328 --> 00:36:42.562
Congratulations, Frank.

434
00:36:44.081 --> 00:36:45.524
Hold it.

435
00:36:45.624 --> 00:36:47.316
That's it.

436
00:36:47.752 --> 00:36:49.779
Well, aren't you going to read it?

437
00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:53.281
Aye.

438
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.246
Well, don't spend it all at
once now, will you, lad?


439
00:37:05.936 --> 00:37:08.713
Well, Frank, what does
it feel like, lad?


440
00:37:08.981 --> 00:37:10.633
I don't feel much.

441
00:37:10.733 --> 00:37:12.218
It's all a bit quick;

442
00:37:12.318 --> 00:37:15.636
I'm afraid that's my fault. I like
to get these things settled.


443
00:37:16.364 --> 00:37:17.848
I suppose you don't mind.

444
00:37:17.948 --> 00:37:19.849
Not now, I don't.

445
00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:23.853
Did you have any other offers?

446
00:37:24.038 --> 00:37:27.400
No... at least,
I didn't hear anything.


447
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.069
Well, if you do,
you'll know what to say...


448
00:37:30.169 --> 00:37:32.071
property of the city.

449
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.159
Best to make sure, Frank.

450
00:37:38.552 --> 00:37:41.414
Fairfax Street...
now, that rings a bell.


451
00:37:41.514 --> 00:37:44.292
Aye. A fellow called Hammond
used to live there.


452
00:37:44.392 --> 00:37:46.793
He got killed at your place...

453
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.087
Weaver's.

454
00:37:50.398 --> 00:37:52.425
I've digs with his widow.

455
00:37:52.525 --> 00:37:54.677
Hammond.

456
00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:56.971
Yes, Eric Hammond, wasn't it?

457
00:37:57.071 --> 00:37:58.180
Yeah.

458
00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.931
Well, I remember the funeral.

459
00:38:00.116 --> 00:38:01.934
How'd he get killed?

460
00:38:02.034 --> 00:38:03.686
Quite nasty.

461
00:38:03.786 --> 00:38:05.604
He was working with a lathe.

462
00:38:05.704 --> 00:38:07.523
Very careless.

463
00:38:07.623 --> 00:38:09.442
He was using a hand-file.

464
00:38:09.542 --> 00:38:12.443
It shot off and stuck
half-way through him.


465
00:38:14.004 --> 00:38:17.031
We had half an idea he'd
done it on purpose.


466
00:38:20.636 --> 00:38:22.079
On purpose...

467
00:38:22.179 --> 00:38:23.622
Yes.

468
00:38:23.722 --> 00:38:26.165
Funny way to commit suicide.

469
00:38:27.017 --> 00:38:30.503
She didn't get any compensation.
The case went against her.


470
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:33.923
We gave her a bit... not much.

471
00:38:35.067 --> 00:38:37.718
End of the street, or the front door?

472
00:38:37.903 --> 00:38:40.765
End of the street will do.

473
00:38:40.865 --> 00:38:42.557
Right.

474
00:38:51.459 --> 00:38:54.193
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Mr Weaver.


475
00:39:06.682 --> 00:39:09.417
Frank! Hey, Frank!

476
00:39:10.352 --> 00:39:12.211
Hi, Dad.

477
00:39:12.938 --> 00:39:15.091
What are you doing down here, then?

478
00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:17.009
Did you sign?
Have they signed you on?


479
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:18.844
They wouldn't have me, Dad.

480
00:39:18.944 --> 00:39:20.513
They wouldn't have me.

481
00:39:20.613 --> 00:39:22.139
You ought to have seen 'em.

482
00:39:22.239 --> 00:39:24.141
They're round that Weaver like a...

483
00:39:24.241 --> 00:39:26.642
a pack of dogs around a bitch.

484
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.731
I told them what to do with
their stinking, filthy bastard money.


485
00:39:31.957 --> 00:39:33.734
You haven't done that?

486
00:39:33.834 --> 00:39:35.818
Aye.

487
00:39:40.341 --> 00:39:42.617
You're not crying about it, are you?

488
00:39:43.344 --> 00:39:45.369
You're not crying?

489
00:39:47.598 --> 00:39:49.708
So it was all for nothing, eh? Nay...

490
00:39:49.808 --> 00:39:51.751
Hey, Dad.

491
00:39:52.561 --> 00:39:55.296
I was only kidding you about it!

492
00:39:55.523 --> 00:39:57.590
I was only kidding.

493
00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.428
How much do you think it is?

494
00:40:00.528 --> 00:40:02.430
You tell me, Frank.

495
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.555
You tell me.

496
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:06.933
A thousand quid.

497
00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:08.602
Nay!

498
00:40:08.702 --> 00:40:09.937
Aye.

499
00:40:10.037 --> 00:40:13.147
- D'you want to see the cheque?
- Aye, could I see it?


500
00:40:17.503 --> 00:40:19.613
You and me, Frank...

501
00:40:19.713 --> 00:40:20.990
that's us.

502
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.409
How much of it do you want, Dad?

503
00:40:23.509 --> 00:40:25.453
Oh, no, Frank.

504
00:40:25.553 --> 00:40:27.413
What do you mean, 'oh, no, Frank'?

505
00:40:27.513 --> 00:40:30.249
- Oh, no, Frank, I...
- Now, Dad, listen.


506
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:34.293
I don't en joy getting kicked about on a
football field for other people's amusement.


507
00:40:34.478 --> 00:40:37.381
I only enjoy it if I've
been paid a lot for it.


508
00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:39.925
Now I want you
to share some of this.

509
00:40:40.025 --> 00:40:41.719
No, Frank, I don't want any of it.

510
00:40:41.819 --> 00:40:44.972
All right, then.
I'll send you some of it.


511
00:40:45.072 --> 00:40:49.141
No, wait, Frank. I didn't
do it for the money.


512
00:40:58.627 --> 00:41:01.070
That Johnson called earlier on.

513
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.157
That friend of yours.

514
00:41:03.257 --> 00:41:04.950
I've just seen him.

515
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.786
You mean he's been waiting
all this time? It was hours ago.


516
00:41:07.886 --> 00:41:10.372
He likes to get
out and about a bit.

517
00:41:10.472 --> 00:41:12.208
You should have friends your own age.

518
00:41:12.308 --> 00:41:14.083
I have.

519
00:41:15.603 --> 00:41:17.753
They've signed me on.

520
00:41:20.441 --> 00:41:22.842
Didn't you hear what I said?

521
00:41:23.193 --> 00:41:24.470
Yes.

522
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.804
You'll be pleased.

523
00:41:25.904 --> 00:41:28.514
So will you when you
guess how much it is.


524
00:41:28.657 --> 00:41:30.684
Oh, I don't know anything about it.

525
00:41:30.784 --> 00:41:32.645
Go on, have a guess.

526
00:41:32.745 --> 00:41:35.646
Just guess how much
you think I'm worth.


527
00:41:36.498 --> 00:41:38.192
Three pence?

528
00:41:38.292 --> 00:41:40.778
Now, careful, careful...

529
00:41:40.878 --> 00:41:42.696
you made a joke.

530
00:41:42.796 --> 00:41:46.615
You can't go round cracking jokes like that,
you know... you might do yourself an injury.


531
00:41:48.552 --> 00:41:50.579
Well, come on, have a guess.

532
00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:52.496
Come on.

533
00:41:53.015 --> 00:41:54.124
No...

534
00:41:54.224 --> 00:41:56.917
Well, I'd better tell you
since you're so keen.


535
00:41:57.978 --> 00:42:00.838
One thousand pounds.

536
00:42:06.236 --> 00:42:07.638
Oh...

537
00:42:07.738 --> 00:42:09.390
you're a great ape.

538
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.058
You don't believe me?

539
00:42:11.158 --> 00:42:13.642
Look, I've got the cheque
here in my pocket.


540
00:42:15.663 --> 00:42:18.607
One thousand pounds in
letters and in numbers.


541
00:42:18.707 --> 00:42:20.941
Signed, sealed and delivered,
Frank Machin.


542
00:42:21.502 --> 00:42:24.820
They drove me home in their car...
a bloody Bentley!


543
00:42:28.217 --> 00:42:30.242
It's very good.

544
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.708
You don't sound very
excited about it.


545
00:42:39.186 --> 00:42:42.296
It's a bit more than I got
when my husband died.


546
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.679
Well, isn't that right
bloody handsome of you!


547
00:42:48.779 --> 00:42:50.514
You didn't have to
do anything for it.


548
00:42:50.614 --> 00:42:52.975
You mean I didn't have
to get killed for it!


549
00:42:53.075 --> 00:42:54.935
Some people have life made for them.

550
00:42:55.035 --> 00:42:57.895
That's right, Mrs Hammond, and some
people make it for themselves.


551
00:43:06.672 --> 00:43:09.698
It's about time you took that
ton of rock off your shoulders.


552
00:43:10.884 --> 00:43:13.077
And don't wake me in the morning,
I might be dead!


553
00:43:36.952 --> 00:43:38.894
That money...

554
00:43:39.705 --> 00:43:41.522
does it mean you'll be leaving now?

555
00:43:42.666 --> 00:43:44.066
No.

556
00:43:45.377 --> 00:43:47.194
I don't think so.

557
00:44:30.964 --> 00:44:32.116
...keeping herself...

558
00:44:32.216 --> 00:44:33.616
You're done.

559
00:44:34.384 --> 00:44:35.743
...so small

560
00:44:38.764 --> 00:44:40.164
small...

561
00:44:41.266 --> 00:44:45.087
You'd better get him off home. He'll be
all right when he gets in the fresh air.


562
00:44:45.187 --> 00:44:46.797
Get him into bed.

563
00:44:46.897 --> 00:44:49.965
Doesn't understand...
Keeping herself small...


564
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.432
Ooh!

565
00:44:56.532 --> 00:44:59.475
Here, come on,
what's the matter, Frank?


566
00:45:00.244 --> 00:45:02.811
She's so... she's so small.

567
00:45:02.913 --> 00:45:06.398
Oh, he's all right...
he's just full of gas, that's all.


568
00:45:07.543 --> 00:45:09.735
Get hold of him...

569
00:45:09.962 --> 00:45:12.780
She's so bloody small...

570
00:45:13.298 --> 00:45:15.407
Are you going to get in, Frank?

571
00:45:17.636 --> 00:45:20.287
She gives me nothing.

572
00:45:20.931 --> 00:45:23.791
She gives me bloody nothing!

573
00:45:43.495 --> 00:45:45.898
'If I were the marrying kind, '

574
00:45:45.998 --> 00:45:47.941
'which thank the Lord I'm not, sir, '

575
00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:52.279
'The kind of man that I would
wed would be a rugby fullback.'


576
00:45:52.379 --> 00:45:54.565
'He'd find touch, ' '
I'd find touch, '

577
00:45:54.666 --> 00:45:56.918
- 'We'd both find touch together...'
- Frank.


578
00:45:57.018 --> 00:46:00.202
'We'd be all right in the
middle of the night, find... '


579
00:46:00.762 --> 00:46:02.664
Oh, the patient's awake!

580
00:46:02.764 --> 00:46:06.542
We've heard all your subconscious
what-nots. Haven't we, Mr Weaver?


581
00:46:07.102 --> 00:46:09.129
My carrier...

582
00:46:09.229 --> 00:46:11.089
What's he want?

583
00:46:11.189 --> 00:46:12.591
My carrier.

584
00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:14.051
My carrier!

585
00:46:14.151 --> 00:46:15.886
Steady, lad, steady!

586
00:46:15.986 --> 00:46:18.053
Did he have a carrier?

587
00:46:18.363 --> 00:46:20.764
Is this it?

588
00:46:23.702 --> 00:46:25.769
What have you got in there, then?

589
00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.524
Presents.

590
00:46:28.624 --> 00:46:31.358
- What did you say?
- Presents!


591
00:46:38.759 --> 00:46:41.410
Come on.

592
00:46:45.682 --> 00:46:47.417
What do you think of it?

593
00:46:47.517 --> 00:46:49.795
- Have you bought it?
- Aye.


594
00:46:49.895 --> 00:46:52.422
It's a bit of all right, isn't it?

595
00:46:52.522 --> 00:46:54.258
You're not going to leave
that thing there, are you?


596
00:46:54.358 --> 00:46:55.634
Why not?

597
00:46:55.734 --> 00:46:57.803
You won't smile when you
come for a drive in it.


598
00:46:57.903 --> 00:47:00.430
'Ere, he can take you out on Sunday
afternoons now, Mrs Hammond!


599
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.098
Don't worry, you'll never
get me to go in that thing.


600
00:47:06.912 --> 00:47:09.855
It's like riding around
in your own front room!


601
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.902
Come on, Ian, let's come for a drive.

602
00:47:14.002 --> 00:47:16.280
Don't mind your mother... come on.

603
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.282
Watch your head.

604
00:47:18.382 --> 00:47:20.534
Hey, I want him for his dinner!

605
00:47:20.634 --> 00:47:22.286
Look, he's got to get back to school!

606
00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:26.330
Don't worry, I'll take him
in this. We won't be long.


607
00:47:35.899 --> 00:47:38.175
Frank, lad, we're there.

608
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.957
It's Frank! Frank Machin!

609
00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:12.793
Come on, Frank.

610
00:48:13.228 --> 00:48:16.588
Hurray!

611
00:48:17.024 --> 00:48:22.386
Come on, show 'em your smile, Frank.
Come on, smile for them, Frankie! Ha, ha!


612
00:48:28.076 --> 00:48:31.353
You shouldn't be here, lad.
Can I take you home?


613
00:48:31.496 --> 00:48:33.564
I'm all right, Dad.

614
00:48:35.709 --> 00:48:37.611
'...He'd push hard, '
'and I'd push hard, '

615
00:48:37.711 --> 00:48:39.696
'We'd both push hard together.'

616
00:48:39.796 --> 00:48:41.573
'And there we'd be in the
middle of the night, '


617
00:48:41.673 --> 00:48:45.617
'pushing hard together.'
'If I were the marrying kind...'


618
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.320
You've come, have you, Frank?

619
00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.030
How are you, then?
All right, darling?


620
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.658
- D'you know where the bathroom is?
- Aye, it's up them stairs, there.


621
00:49:24.758 --> 00:49:26.451
'He'd run hard, '

622
00:49:26.551 --> 00:49:29.536
'and I'd run hard, '
'We'd both run hard together...'


623
00:50:04.297 --> 00:50:07.074
Come on, Frank. It's me, Maurice.

624
00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:10.495
I know you're in there,
you daft frog!


625
00:50:10.595 --> 00:50:12.956
What's the matter? Sulking?

626
00:50:13.056 --> 00:50:16.458
Hey, Frank, come on out, will you!

627
00:50:46.006 --> 00:50:48.075
How far are we going?

628
00:50:48.175 --> 00:50:50.410
I thought we'd make a day of it.

629
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:52.454
Go for a run in the country.

630
00:50:52.554 --> 00:50:54.206
You don't mind, do you?

631
00:50:54.306 --> 00:50:55.957
We can't very well
get out now, can we?


632
00:50:56.057 --> 00:50:58.542
We can stop the car and
turn back, if you're so keen.


633
00:51:00.854 --> 00:51:04.840
Look, if it's only for the children's sake,
it's worth it... don't you reckon?


634
00:51:27.923 --> 00:51:30.117
Come on, Ian.

635
00:51:30.217 --> 00:51:32.202
That's a good boy.

636
00:51:32.302 --> 00:51:34.079
There's a good lad.

637
00:51:34.179 --> 00:51:36.163
Come on, then.

638
00:51:36.598 --> 00:51:38.582
Come to the next one.

639
00:51:41.853 --> 00:51:44.588
Come on, Ian, you throw, then.

640
00:52:14.177 --> 00:52:16.787
Let's go and play soccer, Lynda.

641
00:52:23.895 --> 00:52:26.171
Now give it to me!

642
00:52:38.827 --> 00:52:40.979
Here, gotcha!

643
00:52:41.079 --> 00:52:42.896
I've got you!

644
00:52:43.748 --> 00:52:46.066
Drop it! Drop it! Drop it!

645
00:52:47.919 --> 00:52:50.487
Round and round and round....

646
00:53:04.978 --> 00:53:07.254
Come on, Ian, kick us a goal, then.

647
00:53:09.274 --> 00:53:11.218
Come on Ian, kick us a goal.

648
00:53:11.318 --> 00:53:12.759
Come on, then.

649
00:53:14.863 --> 00:53:17.098
Margaret, catch it!

650
00:53:17.198 --> 00:53:19.142
Oh, I'm no good at catching.

651
00:53:19.242 --> 00:53:21.144
Come on, Lynda. 
Come on, then.

652
00:53:21.244 --> 00:53:22.354
Catch it.

653
00:53:22.454 --> 00:53:23.563
Frank!

654
00:53:23.663 --> 00:53:24.856
Catch it!

655
00:53:24.956 --> 00:53:27.107
See, it's easy.

656
00:53:28.793 --> 00:53:30.736
Come on, throw us a catch.

657
00:53:32.505 --> 00:53:34.072
Ooh!

658
00:53:34.591 --> 00:53:36.950
Now look who can't catch!

659
00:53:37.761 --> 00:53:39.913
Come on, Ian. Come on, Ian.

660
00:53:40.013 --> 00:53:41.331
Come on, Ian.

661
00:53:41.431 --> 00:53:43.875
I'll tell you. Catch this.
Ready? Catch this one.


662
00:53:43.975 --> 00:53:46.084
Wa-ay up in the sky.

663
00:53:48.313 --> 00:53:51.089
THE CHILDREN LAUGH

664
00:53:52.942 --> 00:53:55.260
We've lost the ball!

665
00:53:55.779 --> 00:53:58.013
Frank, take me with you!

666
00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:11.193
Lynda!

667
00:54:12.754 --> 00:54:14.571
Lynda.

668
00:54:15.173 --> 00:54:19.159
Lynda, stop waving, you'll have
Mr Machin fall into the water.


669
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.871
Oh, give over!

670
00:54:23.098 --> 00:54:25.375
Look, be careful!

671
00:54:25.475 --> 00:54:27.042
Lynda!

672
00:54:29.979 --> 00:54:32.714
Look, be careful, love.

673
00:54:42.534 --> 00:54:44.561
Mam did you see us.

674
00:54:44.661 --> 00:54:46.855
Whatever did you want
to go and do that for?


675
00:54:46.955 --> 00:54:48.356
I just wanted to cool off a bit.

676
00:54:48.456 --> 00:54:49.858
One, two, three...

677
00:54:49.958 --> 00:54:52.027
- Mam, mam, did you see us?
- Yes, I did.


678
00:54:52.127 --> 00:54:54.444
Come on, Ian. I'll change my shoes.

679
00:55:15.733 --> 00:55:18.343
Go on, get it!

680
00:55:25.285 --> 00:55:28.144
He's got done it! Machin!

681
00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:32.000
Come here!

682
00:56:35.313 --> 00:56:38.465
Hey, make a good job of it.

683
00:56:38.566 --> 00:56:40.842
Aye, Mr Wade.

684
00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:45.138
Come on, you two fairies,
let's have you out of here.


685
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:48.725
Why don't you come in, Ken, and let's
have a look and see what you've got!


686
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:50.846
I'll come in and show you
what I've got, all right.


687
00:56:50.947 --> 00:56:52.689
Come on, I mean it,
let's have you out.


688
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:54.566
Hey, have you got any more beer?

689
00:56:54.666 --> 00:56:57.527
Len, come on, let's have
this hosepipe on them.


690
00:56:57.627 --> 00:57:00.695
Let's have some cold water on you!

691
00:57:06.052 --> 00:57:08.872
Watch it, it's freezing,
you daft frog, it's freezing!


692
00:57:08.972 --> 00:57:11.331
Right on that body there!

693
00:57:12.058 --> 00:57:14.292
It's lovely.

694
00:57:14.435 --> 00:57:16.463
Oh, that's lovely!

695
00:57:16.563 --> 00:57:18.713
It's beautiful.

696
00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:22.300
It was a good game, you know.
Oh, he's got the makings...


697
00:57:29.409 --> 00:57:31.476
Isn't that Frank Machin over there?

698
00:57:31.953 --> 00:57:33.271
Yes, it is, love.

699
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:34.689
Fond of kids, isn't he?

700
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:37.440
It's not quite how I pictured him.

701
00:57:38.126 --> 00:57:40.028
Right down the wing, you throw
an over head pass like that...


702
00:57:40.128 --> 00:57:42.862
- Ready, Frank?
- Aye, one moment.


703
00:57:44.299 --> 00:57:46.324
Have you seen Cleopatra?

704
00:57:47.135 --> 00:57:49.120
Well, she looks all right,
doesn't she?


705
00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.705
Would you like to meet him?

706
00:57:50.805 --> 00:57:52.457
Yes, ask him over.

707
00:57:52.557 --> 00:57:53.917
Frank.

708
00:57:54.017 --> 00:57:56.002
Come over here a moment.

709
00:57:56.102 --> 00:57:57.794
The Emperor calls.

710
00:57:59.522 --> 00:58:02.007
Here, go steady, you bloody nut.

711
00:58:05.278 --> 00:58:08.139
Well done, Frank. Well done, lad.
And how are you feeling?


712
00:58:08.239 --> 00:58:09.933
- Champion.
- Good


713
00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:12.767
I'd like you to meet my wife, Frank.

714
00:58:13.244 --> 00:58:14.687
How do you do.

715
00:58:14.787 --> 00:58:18.691
Frank Machin. You're one of the stalwarts
of the City, according to my husband.


716
00:58:18.791 --> 00:58:20.777
That's a relief.

717
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.447
Well, he doesn't seem to
be a very sociable giant.


718
00:58:24.547 --> 00:58:26.157
He's probably shy.

719
00:58:26.257 --> 00:58:29.244
I've asked my husband to introduce us
before, but he's such a slowcoach.


720
00:58:29.344 --> 00:58:32.247
I like meeting his protÃ©gÃ©s
every now and then.


721
00:58:32.347 --> 00:58:35.083
I think he sometimes keeps
them too much to himself.


722
00:58:35.183 --> 00:58:36.626
All his stars.

723
00:58:36.726 --> 00:58:39.337
We don't have stars in
this game, Mrs Weaver.


724
00:58:39.437 --> 00:58:40.588
That's soccer.

725
00:58:40.688 --> 00:58:42.714
Well, what do you have, then?

726
00:58:43.524 --> 00:58:45.009
People like me.

727
00:58:49.447 --> 00:58:51.432
I've got a thirst;
I think I'll be off.


728
00:58:51.532 --> 00:58:52.684
Glad to have met you.

729
00:58:52.784 --> 00:58:53.726
Goodbye, Machin.

730
00:58:53.826 --> 00:58:54.811
- Goodbye, Frank.
- Goodbye, Frank.


731
00:58:54.911 --> 00:58:56.686
You played a great game.
Now, keep it up, lad.


732
00:59:02.502 --> 00:59:04.194
Machin.

733
00:59:05.755 --> 00:59:07.864
You did very well today, young man.

734
00:59:08.383 --> 00:59:09.701
Thank you, Mr Slomer.

735
00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:11.452
Yes, very good try.

736
00:59:11.552 --> 00:59:13.746
Yes, very good indeed. Keep it up.

737
00:59:13.846 --> 00:59:15.705
Thank you, Mr Slomer.

738
00:59:17.975 --> 00:59:19.752
Come on. Watch the door.

739
00:59:19.852 --> 00:59:21.921
Hallo, Frank.

740
00:59:22.021 --> 00:59:23.963
Hi, Dad.

741
00:59:29.612 --> 00:59:32.181
'Walking back to happiness, '

742
00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:34.517
'Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...'

743
00:59:34.617 --> 00:59:36.603
'Bid farewell to loneliness,

744
00:59:36.703 --> 00:59:39.772
'Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...'

745
00:59:39.872 --> 00:59:41.733
'I never knew I'd miss you.'

746
00:59:41.833 --> 00:59:45.068
Hey, love... what d'you
wear when it's hot?


747
00:59:45.169 --> 00:59:47.155
Where's your husband gone, fishing?

748
00:59:47.255 --> 00:59:49.616
Aye, he's left his bloody
bait at home, an all!


749
00:59:49.716 --> 00:59:51.993
'Making up for things we said, '

750

751
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:56.830
'And mistakes to which they led...'

752
00:59:57.932 --> 01:00:01.251
Hey, love, show us your personality!

753
01:00:03.604 --> 01:00:06.049
Hey, Maurice, how's that
tart of yours, then?


754
01:00:06.149 --> 01:00:07.925
- Who? Judith?
- Aye.


755
01:00:08.025 --> 01:00:10.677
Does she come across
with the old, er, one-two?


756
01:00:10.945 --> 01:00:12.513
Now, watch it, Frank.

757
01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:15.475
Just be careful whose bloody
coat tail you're pulling.


758
01:00:15.575 --> 01:00:18.061
Oh, Maurice, you know
I love you, don't you?


759
01:00:18.161 --> 01:00:20.687
I'm not your flag to wave
up and down the street!


760
01:00:21.497 --> 01:00:24.691
You need stuffing, Maurice,
you know that, don't you?


761
01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:26.277
Women!

762
01:00:26.377 --> 01:00:27.862
Bloody women!

763
01:00:27.962 --> 01:00:30.031
'Walking back to happiness.'

764
01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:32.283
'Walking back to happiness.'

765
01:00:32.383 --> 01:00:36.744
'Walking back to happiness...'

766
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:39.372
'...again.'

767
01:00:56.657 --> 01:00:58.393
Oh, here she comes.

768
01:00:58.493 --> 01:01:00.436
Hey, she's brought
her mother with her.


769
01:01:00.536 --> 01:01:01.896
Hallo.

770
01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:03.690
Hallo, love.

771
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.317
Er, this is the tart I
was telling you about.


772
01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:08.073
Oh, God, just listen to the
way he talks about me!


773
01:01:08.174 --> 01:01:09.404
I think I'll come back
when you've done.


774
01:01:09.504 --> 01:01:11.197
Aye. You should have come
in a few minutes ago.


775
01:01:11.297 --> 01:01:12.657
How do, Judith.

776
01:01:12.757 --> 01:01:14.242
Oh, he has told you my name, then?

777
01:01:14.342 --> 01:01:16.452
That and, er, other things.

778
01:01:16.552 --> 01:01:18.912
Ooh, watch it, Tarzan.

779
01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:22.041
Oh, yeah... this is Pam.

780
01:01:22.141 --> 01:01:23.167
Hallo.

781
01:01:23.267 --> 01:01:24.627
How do you do?

782
01:01:24.727 --> 01:01:26.628
- Hallo, Pam.
- Hallo.


783
01:01:29.106 --> 01:01:31.633
I saw your try this afternoon.

784
01:01:32.235 --> 01:01:34.178
I got a good pass.

785
01:01:34.278 --> 01:01:36.554
Ooh, ain't he modest!

786
01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:43.980
- Would you like a drink?
- Gin and orange.


787
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.232
Gin and orange.

788
01:01:46.332 --> 01:01:48.818
- Judith?
- Gin and tonic, please.


789
01:01:48.918 --> 01:01:50.860
Gin and tonic.

790
01:01:51.295 --> 01:01:53.072
Hey, Keith?

791
01:01:53.172 --> 01:01:56.199
A little service, Keith.
Come on, a little service.


792
01:02:06.936 --> 01:02:09.963
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

793
01:02:10.648 --> 01:02:13.736
are there any volunteers? Is there
anyone at all that can dance,


794
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:18.629
sing, hum, show their muscles, do a
striptease, fan dance or bubble dance?


795
01:02:20.533 --> 01:02:22.642
Come on, Maurice!

796
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:25.146
Go on, Maurice, do a dance!

797
01:02:25.246 --> 01:02:28.483
I see we have a few of
our City heroes here tonight...


798
01:02:28.583 --> 01:02:31.401
including our old friend,
Frank Machin.


799
01:02:33.212 --> 01:02:35.613
Come on, Frank, give a song.

800
01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:39.993
Come on, Frank.

801
01:02:52.148 --> 01:02:54.299
All right, Frank?

802
01:02:54.442 --> 01:02:56.676
Right.

803
01:02:57.445 --> 01:02:59.639
Right. Pick your mike up.

804
01:03:01.532 --> 01:03:03.059
Right.

805
01:03:04.994 --> 01:03:07.937
'Here, in my heart, '

806
01:03:08.372 --> 01:03:12.525
'I'm alone and so lonely.'

807
01:03:13.544 --> 01:03:16.322
'Here, in my heart, '

808
01:03:16.422 --> 01:03:20.908
'I just yearn for you only.'

809
01:03:21.427 --> 01:03:28.499
'Here in my arms,
I long to hold you, '


810
01:03:29.143 --> 01:03:35.965
'Hold you so near,
ever close to my heart.'


811
01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:38.511
'So, darling...

812
01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:45.183
'...say that you care,
'Take my love...'


813
01:03:45.576 --> 01:03:48.186
'...I give gladly.'

814
01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:53.192
'Surely you know...'

815
01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:58.446
'...I need your love so badly.'

816
01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:01.532
'Here in my heart.'

817
01:04:01.801 --> 01:04:07.163
'My love and my all, dear.'

818
01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:12.210
'Here in my arms...

819
01:04:12.812 --> 01:04:20.303
and stay here in my heart.'

820
01:04:50.391 --> 01:04:54.794
Hey, come on, get the door open.
There's not a bloody war on!


821
01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:04.388
I'm sorry I'm late.

822
01:05:04.488 --> 01:05:06.182
It's all right.

823
01:05:06.282 --> 01:05:08.766
Hah, that's all right, then.

824
01:05:10.536 --> 01:05:12.521
You've been drinking.

825
01:05:12.621 --> 01:05:14.273
Aren't you going to
ask me how we got on?


826
01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:16.025
Why, did you play football
until this time, then?


827
01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:17.860
No. I've been out with the lads...

828
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.904
you know...

829
01:05:20.004 --> 01:05:21.739
living.

830
01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:23.282
You must have had a hard time.

831
01:05:23.382 --> 01:05:25.867
As a matter of fact, we did.

832
01:05:33.893 --> 01:05:35.795
You're drunk.

833
01:05:35.895 --> 01:05:37.755
You've come back here drunk.

834
01:05:37.855 --> 01:05:40.675
That's no bloody crime.

835
01:05:40.775 --> 01:05:44.053
You're not me mother...
me something or other.


836
01:05:44.153 --> 01:05:45.972
What are you getting on about?

837
01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:47.556
Sssh!

838
01:05:47.656 --> 01:05:49.517
I tell you...

839
01:05:49.617 --> 01:05:51.851
I'd like it a lot...

840
01:05:52.036 --> 01:05:56.606
if you'd let me call
you 'Sunshine', Margaret.


841
01:05:56.707 --> 01:05:58.941
'Sunshine'.

842
01:06:06.842 --> 01:06:09.535
'Sunshine...'

843
01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:08.302
Ian! Don't go getting it
all over your clothes!


844
01:07:49.653 --> 01:07:51.138
Lynda?

845
01:07:51.238 --> 01:07:52.723
Yes, Mum?

846
01:07:52.823 --> 01:07:54.225
Where are you, love?

847
01:07:54.325 --> 01:07:55.768
In the kitchen.

848
01:07:55.868 --> 01:07:58.644
Oh, that's all right, then.
I just wondered where you were.


849
01:08:04.627 --> 01:08:07.278
Oh, I... I didn't know you were in.

850
01:08:07.463 --> 01:08:10.031
I was just going
to make up the bed.

851
01:08:10.925 --> 01:08:13.327
I'm off to work in half an hour.

852
01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:15.828
I didn't hear you come in.

853
01:08:16.347 --> 01:08:20.583
I never know where I am, what
with the... children on holiday.


854
01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:32.656
No, Frank, no!

855
01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:34.658
It's all right.

856
01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:36.493
Oh, no!

857
01:09:36.593 --> 01:09:37.953
It's all right.

858
01:09:38.053 --> 01:09:39.538
Frank, no!

859
01:09:39.638 --> 01:09:41.747
No... Frank!

860
01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:49.004
Mam!

861
01:09:51.984 --> 01:09:54.094
Go away, Lynda.

862
01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:56.138
Go away, Lyn.

863
01:09:56.238 --> 01:09:57.765
What are you doing, Mam?

864
01:09:57.865 --> 01:09:59.975
Go on out to play, Lynda, love.

865
01:10:00.075 --> 01:10:01.685
Mam!

866
01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:03.479
Go away, Lynda.

867
01:10:03.579 --> 01:10:05.396
Go away!

868
01:10:18.802 --> 01:10:20.746
Oh...!

869
01:10:20.846 --> 01:10:23.122
You're a man!

870
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:25.708
You're a bleedin' man!

871
01:12:02.406 --> 01:12:04.807
Aren't you going to say anything?

872
01:12:25.512 --> 01:12:28.207
You made a right bloody muck-up
of that loose forward!


873
01:12:28.307 --> 01:12:30.709
Aye, he won't play
again for six months!


874
01:12:30.809 --> 01:12:32.544
Better watch out you
don't get suspended!


875
01:12:32.644 --> 01:12:35.130
What else could I do...
what else could I do?


876
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:37.549
Look, this big character comes around the
blind side every time there's a scrum.


877
01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:39.134
I just stand in his way,
he's never looking.


878
01:12:39.234 --> 01:12:40.928
'Stand in his way!'

879
01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:44.306
I get me shoulder under his jaw...
booph! He goes down like a child.


880
01:12:44.406 --> 01:12:45.391
He did!

881
01:12:45.491 --> 01:12:46.934
I began to count the times
he came around that scrum.


882
01:12:47.034 --> 01:12:49.686
Fourteen times. I must've
hit every part of his face.


883
01:12:49.786 --> 01:12:53.232
You should have seen him.
Bradshaw, that's the name.


884
01:12:53.332 --> 01:12:56.360
Aye, and the fifteenth time he came
round, they carried him off... flat out.


885
01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.404
He bloody were, an' all!

886
01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:00.406
You could hear the
crack all over t' ground.


887
01:13:00.506 --> 01:13:03.117
Aye, it just proves I'm a
good defensive player.


888
01:13:05.969 --> 01:13:07.454
Hello, Charles.

889
01:13:07.554 --> 01:13:09.248
Hello, Frank, how's it going?

890
01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:10.999
Champion, Mr Slomer. Champion.

891
01:13:11.099 --> 01:13:13.168
I hope you're not giving too
many trade secrets away.


892
01:13:13.268 --> 01:13:15.337
Have you changed your mind
about Frank, then, Charles?


893
01:13:15.437 --> 01:13:17.172
Oh, now, steady, John.

894
01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:19.842
When Weaver first signed him,
I thought we were making a mistake.


895
01:13:19.942 --> 01:13:21.885
But I don't mind admitting it...

896
01:13:21.985 --> 01:13:25.848
this big lad gives me as much pleasure on
that football field as anybody can today.


897
01:13:25.948 --> 01:13:29.435
Mind you, it's nothing like the old
days, young man... nothing like.


898
01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:31.812
Oh, no, no, no...'course not.

899
01:13:31.912 --> 01:13:32.938
I hear you...

900
01:13:33.038 --> 01:13:36.567
Hi, Ed. I've noticed my photographs
are getting a bit small lately.


901
01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:38.507
- See to it, will you?
- Now, then, tiger.


902
01:13:38.608 --> 01:13:41.804
And put a bit of a smile on
my face when I'm scoring.


903
01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:45.993
Hi, Maurice.

904
01:13:46.093 --> 01:13:48.203
What's up with you, then?

905
01:13:48.303 --> 01:13:50.414
Nothing, I'm just waiting for Judith.

906
01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:52.331
Cop us two, Jack.

907
01:13:53.517 --> 01:13:56.585
I try and take my pleasures quietly.

908
01:14:00.607 --> 01:14:04.636
When I see those
frogs gathered around, I...


909
01:14:04.736 --> 01:14:07.431
just shoot 'em a line, that's all.

910
01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:10.851
Oh, yeah... I brought you your
mail down from the ground.


911
01:14:10.951 --> 01:14:13.978
Half a dozen.
One a week's about my record.


912
01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:22.653
Why don't you bring that... woman of yours
down here some time... that Margaret?


913
01:14:23.130 --> 01:14:25.280
She wouldn't come.

914
01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:29.203
Bloody school-kids!

915
01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:31.662
Why wouldn't she come?

916
01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:33.998
She's a home bird.

917
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:38.504
Are you taking the jam out of somebody's
sandwich without paying for it, then?


918
01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:40.462
Me?

919
01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.343
No, she's a home bird.
I've just told you.


920
01:14:44.443 --> 01:14:46.468
Now shut up.

921
01:14:46.778 --> 01:14:48.764
Watch out with that tiger,
Maurice, he'll snap your hand off.


922
01:14:48.864 --> 01:14:51.141
Oh, I can take care of him, Ed.

923
01:14:51.241 --> 01:14:53.142
Watch it.

924
01:14:54.745 --> 01:14:56.562
Hey, Maurice.

925
01:14:56.663 --> 01:14:58.315
Maurice.

926
01:14:58.415 --> 01:15:00.025
Have a read of that.

927
01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:02.067
Come on.

928
01:15:04.838 --> 01:15:08.033
'Dear Frank Machin,
enjoyed watching you play'...


929
01:15:08.133 --> 01:15:10.327
rare times I watch the game.

930
01:15:10.427 --> 01:15:12.536
Forgive me if...

931
01:15:13.138 --> 01:15:16.208
Perhaps you could drop by for
a drink sometime this week.


932
01:15:16.308 --> 01:15:19.668
Wednesday afternoon might be suitable.
Best wishes, Ann Weaver.'


933
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:22.421
Ann Weaver?

934
01:15:23.148 --> 01:15:25.382
You're not going, are you?

935
01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:27.801
Read the P.S.

936
01:15:29.071 --> 01:15:32.516
'P.S. This doesn't mean bring
any of your rowdy team mates.'


937
01:15:32.616 --> 01:15:34.309
Is that meant to be a
joke or something?


938
01:15:34.409 --> 01:15:36.019
You're not taking
it seriously, are you?


939
01:15:36.119 --> 01:15:37.646
Why not? I've got nothing to lose.

940
01:15:37.746 --> 01:15:39.231
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

941
01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:41.149
She just thinks I'm
good-looking, that's all.


942
01:15:41.249 --> 01:15:44.068
- Give us a kiss, will you?
- Don't come with that, Maurice.


943
01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:52.035
Careful, Tarzan!
What're you doing to him?


944
01:15:52.135 --> 01:15:54.538
Come on, I want some
husband left, you know!


945
01:15:54.638 --> 01:15:57.082
How d'you mean, 'husband'?

946
01:15:57.182 --> 01:15:59.459
Why, hasn't he told you?
We just got engaged.


947
01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:01.752
- Hey, shut up!
- Engaged?


948
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.881
No wonder... no wonder
he's been so rough!


949
01:16:04.981 --> 01:16:07.634
Eh, the Lord help you.
Give us a kiss, love.


950
01:16:07.734 --> 01:16:10.679
Congratulations, Maurice. When are they
going to start ringing them bells, then?


951
01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:12.681
- We're planning on Easter.
- Oh-ho!


952
01:16:12.781 --> 01:16:15.183
Well, you'll be laughing again yourself
when it happens to you, Tarzan.


953
01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:17.769
'When it happens to me'?
I'll put up a bigger fight than that.


954
01:16:17.869 --> 01:16:21.730
No, they're never satisfied,
are they, Maurice? Women!


955
01:16:24.084 --> 01:16:26.318
They don't frighten me, Maurice...

956
01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:28.570
they don't frighten me.

957
01:16:57.951 --> 01:16:59.478
Happy Christmas.

958
01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:01.728
Happy Christmas.

959
01:17:02.581 --> 01:17:06.568
Oh, we're having a party on Christmas Eve.
You'll be coming, of course?


960
01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:10.822
We've got a match Christmas Eve; it's a
Saturday. But I could come on afterwards.


961
01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:12.948
Well, see you do, then.

962
01:17:23.143 --> 01:17:27.421
I suppose playing professional football,
you don't need a full-time job?


963
01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:29.883
Not unless you're
interested in the money.


964
01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:31.551
Are you, Frank?

965
01:17:31.651 --> 01:17:33.804
I like to put it to good uses.

966
01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:36.014
Like what, for example?

967
01:17:36.114 --> 01:17:38.765
Well, like helping people out,
things like that.


968
01:17:39.493 --> 01:17:41.977
Is that why you bought
such a big car?


969
01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:46.775
I must say,
you've been very successful.


970
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:51.528
Well, it's like this, Mrs. Weaver: you see
something and you go out and you get it.


971
01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:54.074
It's as simple as that.

972
01:17:54.174 --> 01:17:56.658
You make it sound very simple.

973
01:18:08.188 --> 01:18:10.756
Do you like gardens?

974
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:12.718
No.

975
01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:15.135
Oh, Frank.

976
01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:37.075
Have another drink.

977
01:18:37.175 --> 01:18:39.368
Help yourself.

978
01:18:43.014 --> 01:18:45.459
You're not playing football
this afternoon, are you?


979
01:18:45.559 --> 01:18:47.334
No.

980
01:18:47.936 --> 01:18:51.421
I like you. You're like a big cat.

981
01:18:54.568 --> 01:18:58.430
You're always moving. I've never
seen anyone so restless.


982
01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:00.639
Come and sit down.

983
01:19:04.202 --> 01:19:06.271
I'm not so sure I should be here.

984
01:19:06.371 --> 01:19:09.941
Oh, Frank, don't take
that silly attitude.


985
01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:12.401
Come and sit down.

986
01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:19.451
Nothing's happened
to upset you, has it?


987
01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:21.453
No, nothing.

988
01:19:21.553 --> 01:19:24.371
There's no need to feel awkward.

989
01:19:37.319 --> 01:19:38.595
I don't know...

990
01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:41.013
Don't talk.

991
01:19:43.575 --> 01:19:45.101
I think I ought to go.

992
01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:46.853
Oh, why?

993
01:19:46.953 --> 01:19:49.855
I thought you were
behaving so nicely.


994
01:19:51.958 --> 01:19:53.735
I don't think it's fair.

995
01:19:53.835 --> 01:19:55.819
Oh, 'fair'!

996
01:20:00.884 --> 01:20:04.037
You're not feeling... you know...
out of your depth?


997
01:20:04.137 --> 01:20:05.997
I might be.

998
01:20:06.097 --> 01:20:09.624
Well, there's no need,
you can see it...


999
01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.130
It's not Mrs Hammond, is it?

1000
01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:18.802
Mrs Hammond?

1001
01:20:18.902 --> 01:20:20.927
The woman you live with.

1002
01:20:21.446 --> 01:20:23.388
I lodge there.

1003
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.642
Whatever way you
like to put it. Is it her?


1004
01:20:25.742 --> 01:20:29.144
I've been thinking about Mr Weaver.

1005
01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:32.939
Oh, I see.

1006
01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:35.610
I think I'll go.

1007
01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.445
You're going?

1008
01:20:37.545 --> 01:20:39.030
Look, I think that...

1009
01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:41.116
There's no need to explain, Frank...

1010
01:20:41.216 --> 01:20:43.076
You don't seem to understand...

1011
01:20:43.176 --> 01:20:45.577
Either come in, or go!

1012
01:20:53.103 --> 01:20:56.380
Say it... say it, say it,
say it, say it...


1013
01:20:57.273 --> 01:20:59.216
Say it!

1014
01:21:02.404 --> 01:21:04.514
Why don't you say it?

1015
01:21:04.614 --> 01:21:06.807
Say what?

1016
01:21:10.578 --> 01:21:13.313
Say you've got some feeling for me.

1017
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.567
Frank, I can't.

1018
01:21:18.294 --> 01:21:20.362
Not yet.

1019
01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:23.657
But you know me,
and how I've been to you.


1020
01:21:24.092 --> 01:21:25.994
I can't let my feelings go.

1021
01:21:26.094 --> 01:21:27.828
Not again.

1022
01:21:28.054 --> 01:21:30.539
Not to have them cut
off like Eric and...


1023
01:21:30.682 --> 01:21:34.084
everything gone in one person,
and... and dead.


1024
01:21:34.894 --> 01:21:36.755
You've got to give me time, Frank.

1025
01:21:36.855 --> 01:21:39.841
There may not be enough of
us left to enjoy it by that time.


1026
01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:41.718
Oh I don't know...

1027
01:21:41.818 --> 01:21:44.471
You might just want to
hear me say it. You...


1028
01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:47.557
You... might feel that's all
you wanted, and go away.


1029
01:21:47.657 --> 01:21:49.643
But you keep fighting me.

1030
01:21:49.743 --> 01:21:51.728
I can't be that bad.

1031
01:21:51.828 --> 01:21:53.563
When are you going
to give us some peace?


1032
01:21:53.663 --> 01:21:55.231
I come upstairs with you, don't I?

1033
01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:58.485
But you make me feel I'm buying it,
I'm just buying, and I'm not!


1034
01:21:58.585 --> 01:22:01.788
Well, that's me. That's how I am.
I've nothing more to give you, Frank.


1035
01:22:01.888 --> 01:22:04.433
- You don't mean that.
- I wish you wouldn't work me up like this,


1036
01:22:04.534 --> 01:22:07.133
telling me how I should feel.
If only you'd leave me alone a bit....


1037
01:22:07.177 --> 01:22:11.079
You're so... big, Frank, you're so stupid.
You don't give me a chance!


1038
01:22:23.318 --> 01:22:31.725
Oh, my God...

1039
01:22:51.054 --> 01:22:53.622
Maurice.

1040
01:23:25.463 --> 01:23:27.697
Mauri...

1041
01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:31.369
Well, Machin. What do you want?

1042
01:23:31.469 --> 01:23:34.829
Hallo, Frank.
Come in, we won't eat you.


1043
01:23:39.561 --> 01:23:43.171
Well, Gerald, aren't you going to
offer a drink to this wild young man?


1044
01:23:45.525 --> 01:23:48.009
A whiskey will do.

1045
01:23:53.783 --> 01:23:56.059
Mrs Weaver.

1046
01:23:56.536 --> 01:23:58.980
They're making a lot
of noise downstairs.


1047
01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.607
Last time I open my house to this crowd.
Every scruff in town seems to be here.


1048
01:24:03.668 --> 01:24:06.444
You've been in the wars
this week, young man.


1049
01:24:08.548 --> 01:24:10.992
I'll be all right. 
I'll be all right.

1050
01:24:11.092 --> 01:24:14.244
He'll have to learn he has to
pay something for his ambition.


1051
01:24:14.345 --> 01:24:17.040
I think it spoils his looks, though.

1052
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.666
Does it hurt, Machin?

1053
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:22.295
No.

1054
01:24:22.395 --> 01:24:24.214
I don't feel anything.

1055
01:24:24.314 --> 01:24:26.049
Take no notice of 'em, lad.

1056
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:29.009
Mr Slomer's your newest fan.

1057
01:24:29.194 --> 01:24:32.637
You seem to have the kind of
charm that appeals to him.


1058
01:24:33.573 --> 01:24:38.059
I've noticed I'm not the only person who's
found something of interest in Frank.


1059
01:24:38.661 --> 01:24:40.730
What do you mean by that?

1060
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:44.067
Well, Gerald, there was even a time
when you were very impressed by him.


1061
01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:46.111
I carried that boy.

1062
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.320
It was on my back, nobody else's.

1063
01:24:48.796 --> 01:24:51.866
Are you trying to tell me that
you've carried me, or something?


1064
01:24:51.966 --> 01:24:54.784
Yes... from the very beginning.

1065
01:24:55.261 --> 01:24:57.747
I've played myself into
that crumby team.


1066
01:24:57.847 --> 01:25:00.582
But you just don't appreciate how
much help you've had, Frank.


1067
01:25:01.309 --> 01:25:05.545
Look, am I a good
footballer, or am I not?


1068
01:25:05.772 --> 01:25:10.135
The only reason you're in that team now
is because Mr Slomer wants you there.


1069
01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:12.886
Oh, come now, Ann.

1070
01:25:13.613 --> 01:25:16.224
Anyway, I think Frank's
had enough for one day.


1071
01:25:16.324 --> 01:25:19.517
Oh, I see by my onion it's 11:30.

1072
01:25:19.953 --> 01:25:22.063
Time to be going.

1073
01:25:22.163 --> 01:25:24.272
I like to see Christmas in at home.

1074
01:25:26.876 --> 01:25:28.945
Don't bother to come down.

1075
01:25:29.045 --> 01:25:31.946
The young man 'll see that I don't get
into any trouble from your revellers.


1076
01:25:36.511 --> 01:25:38.703
Merry Christmas.

1077
01:25:47.647 --> 01:25:49.174
Tell me, Frank...

1078
01:25:49.274 --> 01:25:54.886
have you been indulging in what I call 'Mrs
Weaver's weakness for social in formalities'?


1079
01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:58.181
Is that your business?

1080
01:25:59.158 --> 01:26:01.434
That's for you to decide.

1081
01:26:04.205 --> 01:26:06.314
No.

1082
01:26:11.254 --> 01:26:13.323
You've been having a good
season so far, Frank.


1083
01:26:13.423 --> 01:26:15.033
- Until today.
- Huh?


1084
01:26:15.133 --> 01:26:16.951
Until today.

1085
01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:18.703
Oh! I see what you mean.

1086
01:26:18.803 --> 01:26:21.998
Still, false teeth can be better looking
than the real thing sometimes.


1087
01:26:22.098 --> 01:26:24.624
What do you think mine are?

1088
01:26:26.602 --> 01:26:28.713
They look very neat.

1089
01:26:28.813 --> 01:26:30.798
Are they false or real?

1090
01:26:30.898 --> 01:26:33.508
False, but they could be real.

1091
01:26:33.818 --> 01:26:35.844
They're false.

1092
01:26:36.779 --> 01:26:39.806
You're in a tricky position
with Weaver, you know.


1093
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:43.560
I know he hasn't
liked me for a bit.

1094
01:26:44.871 --> 01:26:47.564
He thought he had some
sort of ownership over you.


1095
01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:51.067
He just doesn't like
to see it taken away.


1096
01:26:52.045 --> 01:26:53.488
Still...

1097
01:26:53.588 --> 01:26:56.197
you'll be all right as
long as I'm there.


1098
01:26:58.092 --> 01:27:00.326
Do you understand what I mean?

1099
01:27:05.850 --> 01:27:07.751
Aye.

1100
01:27:08.394 --> 01:27:10.295
Right.

1101
01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:14.549
Well... I wish you Merry Christmas.

1102
01:27:16.778 --> 01:27:18.970
Merry Christmas.

1103
01:27:52.063 --> 01:27:54.549
You're Frank Machin, aren't you?

1104
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:57.133
You look different on the field...

1105
01:27:57.276 --> 01:27:59.511
like a tiger.

1106
01:28:12.959 --> 01:28:15.985
You look pale. 
Aren't you well?

1107
01:28:20.383 --> 01:28:22.992
Am I a good footballer?

1108
01:28:24.679 --> 01:28:28.373
Let's go upstairs and
find an empty room, eh?


1109
01:28:31.144 --> 01:28:34.380
'Oh, he's a jolly good fellow.'

1110
01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.298
'For he's a jolly good fellow.'

1111
01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.593
'For he's a jolly good fellow...

1112
01:28:41.112 --> 01:28:44.223
and so say all of us.'

1113
01:28:44.323 --> 01:28:48.893
'And so say all of us.'

1114
01:28:49.328 --> 01:28:54.107
'For he's a jolly good fellow.'

1115
01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:58.237
'For he's a jolly good fellow

1116
01:28:58.337 --> 01:29:00.990
and so say all of us.'

1117
01:29:01.090 --> 01:29:03.409
'And so say all of us,

1118
01:29:03.509 --> 01:29:05.620
and so say all of us.'

1119
01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:10.748
'For he's a jolly good fellow.'

1120
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:13.334
'For he's a jolly good fellow...'

1121
01:29:14.437 --> 01:29:17.714
'...and so say all of us.'

1122
01:29:18.065 --> 01:29:19.509
Hip, hip!

1123
01:29:19.609 --> 01:29:21.260
Hurray!

1124
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.887
Hip, hip! Hurray!

1125
01:29:53.684 --> 01:29:56.002
Weaver...

1126
01:29:56.103 --> 01:29:59.213
you're a fifth-rate gutless quack!

1127
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:09.599
'...He'd kick hard, and I'd kick hard,
we'd all kick hard together...'


1128
01:31:49.091 --> 01:31:50.993
It's late.

1129
01:31:51.093 --> 01:31:53.327
Have you only just got back?

1130
01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:57.081
Frank, are you all right?

1131
01:31:58.517 --> 01:32:00.293
Aye. Aye.

1132
01:32:10.696 --> 01:32:12.805
I see you've had a visitor.

1133
01:32:13.157 --> 01:32:15.434
Two. Nobody you know.

1134
01:32:15.534 --> 01:32:17.270
Who might that be?

1135
01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:19.437
Don't get so hoity.

1136
01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:22.231
Just because you don't
know everybody in my life.


1137
01:32:22.958 --> 01:32:25.236
It was Eric's sister and her husband.

1138
01:32:25.336 --> 01:32:27.320
I didn't know he had one.

1139
01:32:27.546 --> 01:32:29.113
Here.

1140
01:32:30.174 --> 01:32:32.617
What do you think of that?

1141
01:32:32.927 --> 01:32:35.119
What is it?

1142
01:32:35.221 --> 01:32:37.206
Is that... is that you?

1143
01:32:37.306 --> 01:32:39.457
It was before I met Eric.

1144
01:32:41.352 --> 01:32:43.087
When was that, then?

1145
01:32:43.187 --> 01:32:45.339
Oh, just at the end of the war.

1146
01:32:45.439 --> 01:32:48.759
We worked in an ordnance
factory, making bombs.


1147
01:32:48.859 --> 01:32:50.678
You should have seen us.

1148
01:32:50.778 --> 01:32:52.637
All women.

1149
01:32:52.988 --> 01:32:55.473
We had some times.

1150
01:32:58.327 --> 01:33:00.438
You weren't married then?

1151
01:33:00.538 --> 01:33:01.939
No.

1152
01:33:02.039 --> 01:33:04.148
Had some chaps, though.

1153
01:33:04.458 --> 01:33:06.527
We had some good fun together.

1154
01:33:06.627 --> 01:33:11.280
Aye... I bet you gave
them a right run around.


1155
01:33:12.049 --> 01:33:14.367
Tell no stories, tell no lies.

1156
01:33:16.262 --> 01:33:18.996
Good God, Frank what have you done?

1157
01:33:23.018 --> 01:33:26.629
I
-I don't look too good, do I?

1158
01:33:26.939 --> 01:33:30.174
I've aged ten years... d'you reckon?

1159
01:33:31.402 --> 01:33:33.262
What have you been doing?

1160
01:33:33.362 --> 01:33:35.264
Have you been fighting?

1161
01:33:35.364 --> 01:33:38.934
No, I got them broken.
The dentist pulled out the bits.


1162
01:33:39.034 --> 01:33:43.856
Six bits, ten guineas. I'm in
the wrong bloody business.


1163
01:33:43.956 --> 01:33:46.107
It's spoilt your looks.

1164
01:33:47.168 --> 01:33:49.443
So I've been told.

1165
01:33:49.670 --> 01:33:51.447
By a girl?

1166
01:33:51.547 --> 01:33:53.739
Who else worries about me?

1167
01:33:56.093 --> 01:33:58.536
You went to Weaver's, then?

1168
01:33:59.305 --> 01:34:01.205
Aye.

1169
01:34:03.225 --> 01:34:06.127
You look ill, Frank.
You oughtn't to have been out.


1170
01:34:08.105 --> 01:34:10.381
Here, what am I going to do...

1171
01:34:10.858 --> 01:34:13.009
with the, the presents for the kids?

1172
01:34:13.235 --> 01:34:15.429
Go on, go on, go on.

1173
01:34:15.529 --> 01:34:18.015
Well... I'll take them up with me
and put them in their stockings.


1174
01:34:18.115 --> 01:34:21.185
And I've... I've got
yours here, an' all.


1175
01:34:21.285 --> 01:34:23.312
You shouldn't have bothered.

1176
01:34:23.412 --> 01:34:25.356
D'you want it now?

1177
01:34:25.456 --> 01:34:27.064
What is it?

1178
01:34:27.208 --> 01:34:29.275
Well, take it.

1179
01:34:29.835 --> 01:34:32.571
No, no... leave it till the morning.

1180
01:34:32.671 --> 01:34:34.572
Don't spoil it.

1181
01:34:36.467 --> 01:34:38.242
Will you put the light out?

1182
01:35:18.342 --> 01:35:21.202
I'd never have guessed
you made bombs.


1183
01:35:22.555 --> 01:35:24.622
Why...

1184
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:27.625
why don't you come to bed with me?

1185
01:35:28.102 --> 01:35:30.670
It'll be cold and I
need looking after.


1186
01:35:32.731 --> 01:35:35.633
Thou knows Mother always
goes to bed with Santa.


1187
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:39.887
All right.

1188
01:35:40.906 --> 01:35:43.432
But just for Christmas, mind?

1189
01:36:12.271 --> 01:36:14.215
All right, I'll make it... five quid.

1190
01:36:14.315 --> 01:36:16.215
Oh, watch your step, now.

1191
01:36:16.358 --> 01:36:18.175
Five quid?

1192
01:36:18.819 --> 01:36:21.012
Come on, it's only money.

1193
01:36:21.155 --> 01:36:23.516
He's worried. You've got
him worried, Maurice.


1194
01:36:23.616 --> 01:36:25.726
'Course, he's a family
man now, you know.


1195
01:36:25.826 --> 01:36:27.812
Aye, but whose bloody family?

1196
01:36:29.788 --> 01:36:32.983
Stuff it, love, or I'll belt you
right across that back seat!


1197
01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:35.735
Now, now... just because we've
got Frank in a corner...


1198
01:36:36.587 --> 01:36:38.197
All right, Maurice.

1199
01:36:38.297 --> 01:36:40.491
We'll see what you're made of.

1200
01:36:40.591 --> 01:36:42.366
There's ten quid there.

1201
01:36:42.593 --> 01:36:44.703
- Oh, bloody hell...
- Stop the bus, I'm getting off here!


1202
01:36:44.803 --> 01:36:46.247
I though you said you
were a friend of mine?


1203
01:36:46.347 --> 01:36:48.998
I am a friend of yours... I've given
you all the money, haven't I?


1204
01:36:54.063 --> 01:36:56.714
All right, I'll see you for ten quid.

1205
01:37:00.319 --> 01:37:02.054
What have you got?

1206
01:37:02.154 --> 01:37:03.888
Nothing much.

1207
01:37:04.239 --> 01:37:06.015
Two pair...

1208
01:37:07.701 --> 01:37:09.477
of kings!

1209
01:37:10.245 --> 01:37:11.981
Bloody hell!

1210
01:37:12.081 --> 01:37:13.691
I'd have bet the whole
stinking bus on 'em!


1211
01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:14.984
I'm not greedy, Maurice.

1212
01:37:15.084 --> 01:37:16.193
Thirty quid's enough.

1213
01:37:16.293 --> 01:37:17.528
She'll murder me.

1214
01:37:17.628 --> 01:37:18.904
Who, Judith?

1215
01:37:19.004 --> 01:37:21.364
- She bloody will an' all.
- Tell her it went to charity.


1216
01:37:22.049 --> 01:37:23.617
You lucky bleeder!

1217
01:37:23.717 --> 01:37:25.202
Is that what you call it?

1218
01:37:25.302 --> 01:37:26.495
It bloody is.

1219
01:37:26.595 --> 01:37:29.038
- Come on, Ken, do you want a hand?
- I might as well.


1220
01:37:32.059 --> 01:37:34.253
I hope you know what
you're doing with the cash.


1221
01:37:34.353 --> 01:37:36.005
I can take care of it, Len.

1222
01:37:36.105 --> 01:37:38.547
Aye, but can it take care of thee?

1223
01:37:39.525 --> 01:37:41.592
Get stuffed, love.

1224
01:37:46.782 --> 01:37:48.599
Margaret!

1225
01:37:49.243 --> 01:37:50.686
I'm coming.

1226
01:37:50.786 --> 01:37:53.521
Come on down, I've got
something to show you.


1227
01:37:54.957 --> 01:37:56.859
We won't be back
too late, Mrs Farrer.


1228
01:37:56.959 --> 01:37:58.235
Oh, all right.

1229
01:37:58.335 --> 01:38:02.239
Look here, why don't you pop
out and get yourself something?


1230
01:38:02.339 --> 01:38:04.658
It's all right, Mr Machin.

1231
01:38:04.758 --> 01:38:07.243
All right, I'll leave it
here for you, then.


1232
01:38:07.594 --> 01:38:09.495
Here she is.

1233
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:15.002
Do you like it?

1234
01:38:15.102 --> 01:38:16.919
It's beautiful, love.

1235
01:38:17.271 --> 01:38:19.088
Oh, thanks.

1236
01:38:21.150 --> 01:38:23.052
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

1237
01:38:23.152 --> 01:38:24.303
What?

1238
01:38:24.403 --> 01:38:26.303
What's the mat...

1239
01:38:32.536 --> 01:38:35.855
Let's put this on, just for a change.

1240
01:38:41.253 --> 01:38:43.280
Oh, no, Frank.

1241
01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:46.949
It's yours. It's here,
it's nobody else's.


1242
01:38:47.634 --> 01:38:49.411
Don't be so silly, Frank, it...

1243
01:38:49.511 --> 01:38:51.662
I want you to have it.

1244
01:38:53.182 --> 01:38:55.501
Look, it won't bite.

1245
01:38:55.601 --> 01:38:57.503
Frank, I can't!

1246
01:38:57.603 --> 01:38:59.546
Well, I can't wear it.

1247
01:38:59.646 --> 01:39:01.924
Now, come on. Come on.

1248
01:39:02.024 --> 01:39:04.008
Oh...

1249
01:39:04.318 --> 01:39:06.095
Just for tonight, then.

1250
01:39:06.195 --> 01:39:08.263
Aye. Just for tonight.

1251
01:39:08.363 --> 01:39:10.431
At least that's a start.

1252
01:39:11.116 --> 01:39:12.683
Erm...

1253
01:39:13.577 --> 01:39:16.020
we won't be back late, Mrs Farrer.

1254
01:39:16.914 --> 01:39:18.898
All right, love.

1255
01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:20.901
Bye-bye for now, then.

1256
01:39:21.001 --> 01:39:23.027
Ta-ra.

1257
01:39:23.754 --> 01:39:25.321
Bye-bye.

1258
01:39:54.034 --> 01:39:56.352
I'm afraid this
table's reserved, sir.


1259
01:39:56.954 --> 01:39:59.189
Hah, you're right, it is reserved.

1260
01:39:59.289 --> 01:40:01.232
For us.

1261
01:40:02.751 --> 01:40:04.820
I'm sorry, sir,
there is a nice table...


1262
01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.987
Look, why don't you get lost, love?

1263
01:40:10.968 --> 01:40:13.454
We could have gone to another table.
He was only doing his job.


1264
01:40:13.554 --> 01:40:18.165
His what? You call that a job?
Traipsing about like a fifty-year old tart?


1265
01:40:19.768 --> 01:40:21.418
Oh, thank you.

1266
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.800
Good evening, madam.

1267
01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:29.803
Oh, good evening, Mrs Weaver.
Mr Weaver. Nice to see you again.


1268
01:40:29.903 --> 01:40:31.972
- Hello, Tom. Keeping well?
- Very well, thank you, sir, and you?


1269
01:40:32.072 --> 01:40:35.476
Er, will you be going straight in,
sir, or will you order in the bar?


1270
01:40:35.576 --> 01:40:38.561
Yes... yes, I think we'll
have a drink first.


1271
01:40:38.996 --> 01:40:40.272
Good evening, madam.

1272
01:40:40.372 --> 01:40:42.147
Hello, Bruce.

1273
01:40:44.668 --> 01:40:46.195
And to follow, madam?

1274
01:40:46.295 --> 01:40:48.864
Er, bird? Duckling's
nice this evening.


1275
01:40:48.964 --> 01:40:51.198
Or meat... a nice steak?

1276
01:40:52.176 --> 01:40:53.911
Er, have you any roast meat?

1277
01:40:54.011 --> 01:40:55.412
Roast beef, madam.

1278
01:40:55.512 --> 01:40:57.748
Yes, and... some vegetables?

1279
01:40:57.848 --> 01:40:59.208
Cauliflower and roast potatoes.

1280
01:40:59.308 --> 01:41:00.709
Thank you very much, madam.

1281
01:41:00.809 --> 01:41:02.336
And for you, sir?

1282
01:41:02.436 --> 01:41:04.213
Well, let's have a look.

1283
01:41:04.313 --> 01:41:06.173
I'll have, er...

1284
01:41:06.273 --> 01:41:10.469
a nice piece of steak... blood rare
some cabbage and some potatoes.


1285
01:41:10.569 --> 01:41:12.137
Er, no soup, sir?

1286
01:41:12.237 --> 01:41:14.723
Aye, I'll have some soup but
make sure there's plenty of it.


1287
01:41:14.823 --> 01:41:17.017
Thank you very much, sir.
Er, anything to drink?


1288
01:41:17.117 --> 01:41:19.186
- Yes, I think we'll have...
- I'll send the wine waiter over, sir.


1289
01:41:19.286 --> 01:41:21.895
Well, what the bloody
hell did you ask me for?


1290
01:41:22.289 --> 01:41:25.441
I bet he comes back with a
bit of fried egg and bacon!


1291
01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:30.779
Watch you don't burn his
whiskers, love! Ha, ha, ha!


1292
01:41:33.342 --> 01:41:35.784
You shouldn't have come here if
you're going to behave like this.


1293
01:41:35.886 --> 01:41:38.872
We're paying for it aren't we?
That's all they're interested in.


1294
01:41:38.972 --> 01:41:42.207
No, it's not. But if you're
going to act like a pig...


1295
01:41:42.517 --> 01:41:46.588
Well, if I'm a pig, what's this load
of fat bastards around here, then?


1296
01:41:46.688 --> 01:41:48.298
Frank, I've told you.

1297
01:41:48.398 --> 01:41:51.151
Now, enjoy yourself...
that's what this place is for.


1298
01:41:51.252 --> 01:41:53.595
I know how to handle these people.

1299
01:41:53.695 --> 01:41:56.223
How's it going, love?
Have they burnt your custard?


1300
01:41:56.323 --> 01:41:57.766
Really!

1301
01:41:57.866 --> 01:42:00.351
These old ladies,
you know they're a bit past it.


1302
01:42:04.248 --> 01:42:05.774
...well, he didn't know
quite what to say.


1303
01:42:05.874 --> 01:42:08.068
- Would you care to order now, sir?
- Oh, thank you.


1304
01:42:08.168 --> 01:42:09.860
Mrs Weaver.

1305
01:42:10.003 --> 01:42:12.114
Your table is already
reserved for you, sir.


1306
01:42:12.214 --> 01:42:14.239
Thank you very much, Thomas.

1307
01:42:14.633 --> 01:42:17.034
Isn't that Frank Machin down there?

1308
01:42:29.773 --> 01:42:32.549
I don't think she's getting
quite what she expected.


1309
01:42:33.068 --> 01:42:36.095
No... but then,
does anybody with Machin?


1310
01:42:36.947 --> 01:42:39.641
Give us the bill, love.
We're leaving.


1311
01:42:39.741 --> 01:42:41.475
Yes, sir.

1312
01:42:41.952 --> 01:42:44.520
- Can I have the fur coat, please?
- Yes, madam.


1313
01:42:44.621 --> 01:42:47.439
Poor thing, I feel
almost sorry for her.


1314
01:42:50.627 --> 01:42:52.362
Is there anything wrong, sir?

1315
01:42:52.462 --> 01:42:55.365
I don't mind paying for what we haven't
had, but has he added it up right?


1316
01:42:55.465 --> 01:42:58.117
I don't think your mate's
very good at his sums.


1317
01:42:58.218 --> 01:42:59.828
I don't think there's
any mistake, sir.


1318
01:42:59.928 --> 01:43:01.205
- Are you sure, now?
- Quite, sir.


1319
01:43:01.305 --> 01:43:04.289
Right. Good, I just
wanted to make certain.


1320
01:43:08.687 --> 01:43:12.966
Er... this is for your trouble.
Be careful how you spend it.


1321
01:43:13.066 --> 01:43:14.842
Thank you, sir.

1322
01:43:20.157 --> 01:43:22.307
Hello, Mr Weaver.

1323
01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.113
Good night, Mr Machin.

1324
01:43:53.190 --> 01:43:56.175
That was Mrs Weaver,
wasn't it, at the restaurant?


1325
01:43:57.319 --> 01:43:58.719
Aye.

1326
01:43:59.404 --> 01:44:01.388
Aren't you friends anymore?

1327
01:44:02.366 --> 01:44:03.600
Who with?

1328
01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.392
Them.

1329
01:44:07.245 --> 01:44:09.480
No, I...

1330
01:44:10.165 --> 01:44:12.274
I've got no need for them.

1331
01:44:21.093 --> 01:44:22.993
Are you coming up?

1332
01:44:23.178 --> 01:44:25.370
Yes... in a minute.

1333
01:45:09.224 --> 01:45:11.542
Well, Frank,
they've got a nice day for it.


1334
01:45:12.519 --> 01:45:13.754
Aye.

1335
01:45:13.854 --> 01:45:15.714
Are you feeling fit for Saturday?

1336
01:45:15.814 --> 01:45:17.798
- Champion, Mr. Slomer.
- That's the way.


1337
01:45:18.567 --> 01:45:21.093
We can't manage
without Frank, you know.


1338
01:45:24.823 --> 01:45:27.641
Congratulations. I hope
you'll both be very happy.


1339
01:45:39.004 --> 01:45:42.072
Aren't you going to kiss her? Go on.

1340
01:45:46.344 --> 01:45:48.579
I won't be a second, Margaret.

1341
01:46:02.652 --> 01:46:05.806
Congratulations, Maurice.
Best of luck. Look after her.


1342
01:46:05.906 --> 01:46:07.806
Thank you very much.

1343
01:46:08.116 --> 01:46:10.058
Well done, Judith.

1344
01:46:10.702 --> 01:46:12.979
See he keeps up to it,
and no backsliding.


1345
01:46:13.079 --> 01:46:14.771
Frank.

1346
01:46:16.625 --> 01:46:18.525
Thanks, Frank.

1347
01:46:20.170 --> 01:46:22.905
Oh, hello, Mr Slomer, how are you?

1348
01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:39.254
Margaret!

1349
01:46:39.439 --> 01:46:41.133
What's the matter?

1350
01:46:41.233 --> 01:46:43.218
Why'd you run off like that?

1351
01:46:43.318 --> 01:46:45.762
In front of all those people, and...

1352
01:46:45.862 --> 01:46:49.014
that young girl. 
It makes me ashamed.

1353
01:46:52.077 --> 01:46:53.894
Ashamed!

1354
01:46:55.997 --> 01:46:59.399
I'm a kept woman, Frank,
how else do you expect me to feel?


1355
01:47:00.835 --> 01:47:02.527
Oh, my God.

1356
01:47:03.755 --> 01:47:05.449
It's no good, Frank.

1357
01:47:05.549 --> 01:47:10.494
That car, me all dressed up in a fur
coat, living in the same house as you.


1358
01:47:10.679 --> 01:47:12.956
If you deal with dirt,
you look dirty.


1359
01:47:13.056 --> 01:47:15.123
People have got eyes, you know.

1360
01:47:16.518 --> 01:47:18.377
Oh...

1361
01:47:46.673 --> 01:47:48.949
You feel like dirt?

1362
01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.244
What do you think?

1363
01:47:53.888 --> 01:47:56.500
It sounds like you want to shove
me off to some other woman.


1364
01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.585
I don't need to do that, do I?

1365
01:47:58.685 --> 01:48:00.961
From what I hear,
you're never short of girls.


1366
01:48:02.272 --> 01:48:05.173
Well, if you think that,
why do you stick with me still?


1367
01:48:05.609 --> 01:48:07.718
I reckon you'll leave me soon.

1368
01:48:08.862 --> 01:48:13.807
Well, that's the first I've
ever heard of it; me leaving.


1369
01:48:14.242 --> 01:48:16.685
I know how you are.

1370
01:48:19.331 --> 01:48:21.940
I thought you were
beginning to feel happy.


1371
01:48:22.626 --> 01:48:24.609
Happy?

1372
01:48:26.421 --> 01:48:28.739
I could say something there,
but I won't.


1373
01:48:29.466 --> 01:48:31.366
Well, go on, say it.

1374
01:48:32.385 --> 01:48:35.829
I'd like to hear you say it;
I'd like to hear you say all of it.


1375
01:48:37.766 --> 01:48:40.459
You don't understand at all, do you?

1376
01:49:13.259 --> 01:49:16.078
You can always sell it if
you're so sure I'm leaving.


1377
01:49:30.652 --> 01:49:33.303
You can open a shop soon with
all the stuff I've bought you.


1378
01:49:33.738 --> 01:49:35.724
You've given us nothing
you haven't had to.


1379
01:49:35.824 --> 01:49:39.102
You don't seem to understand the
reason I've done these things for you.


1380
01:49:39.202 --> 01:49:42.105
Of course I do. It makes you
feel good, it makes you feel big.


1381
01:49:42.205 --> 01:49:43.732
You know how you like to feel big.

1382
01:49:43.832 --> 01:49:46.443
You don't appreciate one bloody
thing I've done for you.


1383
01:49:46.543 --> 01:49:47.986
I've given you a life!

1384
01:49:48.086 --> 01:49:51.573
A life better than any other woman
in this street, but you will not admit it!


1385
01:49:51.673 --> 01:49:55.108
Admit it? You must be mad.
I can't lift my head up in the street


1386
01:49:55.209 --> 01:49:58.536
without somebody pointing at
me and saying I'm your slut!


1387
01:49:58.847 --> 01:50:00.206
Who says that?

1388
01:50:00.306 --> 01:50:03.065
'Who says that?' Just listen to him!
They all laugh at you,


1389
01:50:03.166 --> 01:50:05.851
they all point you out, don't you
know that? Trying to be different!


1390
01:50:05.952 --> 01:50:08.248
And they point me out too,
and Ian and Lynda.


1391
01:50:08.348 --> 01:50:09.791
We're not proper people
now because of you.


1392
01:50:09.891 --> 01:50:12.344
Because you show off every Saturday
in front of thousands of them,


1393
01:50:12.444 --> 01:50:14.137
because you're... you're just
a great ape on a football field.


1394
01:50:14.237 --> 01:50:15.930
Because you want me to be like them!

1395
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:18.058
You want me to crawl
about just like the rest.


1396
01:50:18.158 --> 01:50:22.144
Well, just have a look at the rest.
Take a right good look at 'em.


1397
01:50:23.872 --> 01:50:26.148
Take a right good look at the
bloody people round here.


1398
01:50:26.916 --> 01:50:28.777
There isn't a bleeding
man amongst 'em.


1399
01:50:28.877 --> 01:50:31.529
You're flat on your backs,
and the world crawls above you!


1400
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:34.491
Because they haven't the guts.
Do you understand that?


1401
01:50:34.591 --> 01:50:37.619
They haven't the guts to stand
up and to walk about like me!


1402
01:50:37.719 --> 01:50:40.246
Shout as much as you like,
but just get out of here.


1403
01:50:40.346 --> 01:50:42.040
I don't want you in my house anymore.

1404
01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:44.584
You know you need me.
Why don't you admit it?


1405
01:50:44.684 --> 01:50:46.044
Leave me alone!

1406
01:50:46.144 --> 01:50:49.212
I won't leave you alone,
not until you admit it!


1407
01:50:50.231 --> 01:50:52.883
Margaret, what's the matter?
Margaret?


1408
01:50:53.234 --> 01:50:54.968
Leave me alone.

1409
01:50:59.282 --> 01:51:01.224
Aren't you well?

1410
01:51:02.786 --> 01:51:04.978
Can't you get it into your head?

1411
01:51:05.371 --> 01:51:07.397
We don't need you.

1412
01:51:11.419 --> 01:51:13.278
I don't understand her.

1413
01:51:13.922 --> 01:51:16.531
I don't understand what
she wants from me.


1414
01:51:19.761 --> 01:51:21.953
'A great ape on a football field'.

1415
01:51:24.516 --> 01:51:26.625
That's what she called me.

1416
01:51:26.935 --> 01:51:29.544
A great ape on a football field!

1417
01:51:31.147 --> 01:51:33.425
That's about what we are, isn't it?

1418
01:51:33.525 --> 01:51:35.675
She makes me feel like that.

1419
01:51:37.237 --> 01:51:39.721
She makes me feel clumsy...

1420
01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:45.227
awkward, and big, and... stupid.

1421
01:51:47.205 --> 01:51:49.814
She makes me feel like...

1422
01:51:51.334 --> 01:51:53.485
she makes me feel like...

1423
01:51:53.711 --> 01:51:55.946
I crush...

1424
01:51:56.256 --> 01:51:58.990
I... I crush everything.

1425
01:52:02.512 --> 01:52:06.331
Maybe you're too rough on her.
Some women can't stand it, you know.


1426
01:52:08.142 --> 01:52:09.753
Hallo, Frank.

1427
01:52:09.853 --> 01:52:11.588
Hallo, Maurice.

1428
01:52:11.688 --> 01:52:13.882
I say, you took a bit
of a knock last week!


1429
01:52:13.982 --> 01:52:16.049
I reckon it takes
something to lay you out!


1430
01:52:16.150 --> 01:52:18.553
Aye, see you do better next Saturday!

1431
01:52:25.702 --> 01:52:29.813
That's what they think of me, isn't it?
A great ape on a football field.


1432
01:52:31.124 --> 01:52:32.613
They want someone to act big,

1433
01:52:32.714 --> 01:52:35.201
because they haven't got
the guts to do it themselves.


1434
01:52:36.671 --> 01:52:39.364
They want a hero,
and I am; I am a hero.


1435
01:52:40.008 --> 01:52:41.618
But she won't admit it.

1436
01:52:41.718 --> 01:52:43.743
Do you understand that?

1437
01:52:45.221 --> 01:52:49.040
She needs me, Maurice,
but she will not admit it.


1438
01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:55.755
That's all right. But you can't
be like that to a... to a woman.


1439
01:52:57.483 --> 01:52:59.050
Maurice...

1440
01:52:59.986 --> 01:53:01.928
Maurice, I'm...

1441
01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:06.308
I'm not going to be a
footballer forever.


1442
01:53:07.911 --> 01:53:09.896
I need something...

1443
01:53:09.996 --> 01:53:11.896
for good.

1444
01:53:13.541 --> 01:53:15.775
Something permanent.

1445
01:53:16.461 --> 01:53:18.403
And you reckon it's her?

1446
01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:24.284
Grab my hand.

1447
01:53:33.811 --> 01:53:36.755
I can love someone, can't I?

1448
01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:41.718
I can, can't I?

1449
01:53:45.031 --> 01:53:47.140
I can.

1450
01:53:47.951 --> 01:53:50.393
Perhaps she's the wrong one.

1451
01:53:53.039 --> 01:53:55.106
I need her.

1452
01:53:58.419 --> 01:54:02.238
She's the one thing that
makes me feel wanted.


1453
01:54:06.219 --> 01:54:08.536
I can't lose her.

1454
01:54:17.063 --> 01:54:19.464
You'd better see a doctor.

1455
01:54:20.066 --> 01:54:22.342
I'm just tired.

1456
01:54:30.118 --> 01:54:32.310
Are you going now or in the morning?

1457
01:54:33.329 --> 01:54:35.355
I'm not going at all.

1458
01:54:36.207 --> 01:54:37.859
What is it you
want to make you go?

1459
01:54:37.959 --> 01:54:39.984
I want nothing that you've got.

1460
01:54:40.336 --> 01:54:42.153
I'm staying.

1461
01:54:51.139 --> 01:54:55.250
Thank God there's one part of
my life you've never touched.


1462
01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.460
You mean Eric?

1463
01:54:58.688 --> 01:55:03.051
He's the one thing you can't touch.
And he's the one really good thing.


1464
01:55:03.151 --> 01:55:06.721
Well, let's all get down on our knees and
pray for the good soul of Eric Hammond...


1465
01:55:06.821 --> 01:55:08.723
the father of this house!

1466
01:55:08.823 --> 01:55:10.475
How he must hurt you!

1467
01:55:10.575 --> 01:55:13.770
Well, come on, come on, then... let's put
his bloody boots right back in the hearth!


1468
01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:16.397
You don't know. You don't know.
You don't know.


1469
01:55:16.497 --> 01:55:18.691
If I've seen a crazy thing
in my life, that's it.


1470
01:55:18.791 --> 01:55:22.403
I know enough about you to keep you in
a rubber room for the rest of your life!


1471
01:55:22.503 --> 01:55:25.573
You know nothing about Eric, or me.
You know nothing about Eric!


1472
01:55:25.673 --> 01:55:28.700
I know he put the file
through his guts.


1473
01:55:29.427 --> 01:55:32.495
And you made him so happy,
he went and killed himself!


1474
01:55:34.015 --> 01:55:36.000
Do you want to kill me?

1475
01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:39.170
Eric is dead, you understand?
Eric is dead.


1476
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:40.638
You make me feel I'm nothing.

1477
01:55:40.738 --> 01:55:42.721
- I want you.
- You want to crush me,


1478
01:55:42.822 --> 01:55:46.511
but I won't let you. Because I'm the one
thing you can't have, like everything else!


1479
01:55:46.611 --> 01:55:49.138
- I want you.
- I want you to go.


1480
01:55:49.238 --> 01:55:50.598
I need you.

1481
01:55:50.698 --> 01:55:54.310
I want you to go! I want you to go!
I want you to go...


1482
01:56:24.107 --> 01:56:25.466
Get out!

1483
01:56:25.566 --> 01:56:27.093
- Margaret.
- Get out!


1484
01:56:27.193 --> 01:56:30.555
Oh, please! Please, leave me alone.

1485
01:56:30.655 --> 01:56:32.015
I can't.

1486
01:56:32.115 --> 01:56:33.808
Leave me alone.

1487
01:56:33.908 --> 01:56:37.018
I can't. I can't. I love you.

1488
01:56:41.999 --> 01:56:44.359
I want you to go!

1489
01:56:46.170 --> 01:56:48.154
All right, I'm going.

1490
01:56:49.674 --> 01:56:52.325
And that's the last you'll ever see.

1491
01:57:08.151 --> 01:57:10.385
You're not in any trouble, are you?

1492
01:57:13.906 --> 01:57:16.059
Oh, I'll take your word for it.

1493
01:57:16.159 --> 01:57:18.101
Don't mind who I take,
I'm not choosy.


1494
01:57:21.038 --> 01:57:23.565
But any trouble and no, thank you.

1495
01:57:24.125 --> 01:57:27.944
That's why I gave you that queer
look when you came in just now.


1496
01:57:28.713 --> 01:57:32.699
I always give that look when I
think people might cause trouble.


1497
01:57:32.967 --> 01:57:35.702
I find it puts them off.

1498
01:57:36.053 --> 01:57:37.872
Does Johnson still live here?

1499
01:57:37.972 --> 01:57:40.123
He went a while ago.

1500
01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:51.260
This is yours.

1501
01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.678
You'll be all right here, Whacker.

1502
01:57:54.947 --> 01:57:57.449
You got a lock on that?
You'll be all right.


1503
01:57:57.550 --> 01:58:00.728
These two alarm clocks are nippy,
but they're nice when you know 'em.


1504
01:58:00.828 --> 01:58:02.812
Down here for a holiday?

1505
01:58:17.053 --> 01:58:19.829
By the by, is that
your car out there?


1506
01:58:20.681 --> 01:58:22.917
I meant to tell you, Whacker,
the nippers are mustard round here.


1507
01:58:23.017 --> 01:58:25.293
It'll be all spare parts if
you leave it too long.


1508
01:58:30.566 --> 01:58:33.009
If you want it cleaning
I'll do it for a dollar.


1509
02:00:29.894 --> 02:00:33.047
You'll be all right, now...
you'll be all right.


1510
02:00:33.147 --> 02:00:36.340
Come on, then...
let's get you to bed...


1511
02:00:44.283 --> 02:00:46.269
Is that you?

1512
02:00:46.369 --> 02:00:48.312
Is that you, Frank?

1513
02:00:52.541 --> 02:00:54.859
You dirty bastard!

1514
02:01:19.944 --> 02:01:21.762
Mr Machin?

1515
02:01:21.862 --> 02:01:23.721
Mr Machin.

1516
02:01:25.574 --> 02:01:28.533
If it's Mrs Hammond, she's been
taken ill. She's in the hospital.


1517
02:01:28.634 --> 02:01:30.561
I've got Lynda and Ian with me.

1518
02:01:31.997 --> 02:01:33.441
What?

1519
02:01:33.541 --> 02:01:36.526
Mrs Hammond... she's been taken ill.

1520
02:01:41.465 --> 02:01:43.366
What is it?

1521
02:01:43.676 --> 02:01:45.494
It's an attack.

1522
02:01:45.594 --> 02:01:47.413
Some sort of an attack.

1523
02:01:47.513 --> 02:01:49.956
I've got Lynda and Ian in with me.

1524
02:01:53.018 --> 02:01:54.836
Where is she?

1525
02:01:55.229 --> 02:01:57.421
It's the County.

1526
02:01:58.232 --> 02:02:00.716
It were just a couple of days, I...

1527
02:02:01.402 --> 02:02:03.302
She's badly.

1528
02:02:04.905 --> 02:02:07.558
It's a haemorrhage on
the brain, I'm afraid.


1529
02:02:07.658 --> 02:02:08.934
Is that serious?

1530
02:02:09.034 --> 02:02:12.061
Serious? Oh, yes, it's serious.

1531
02:02:12.872 --> 02:02:14.482
I mean...

1532
02:02:14.582 --> 02:02:16.525
she won't die, will she?

1533
02:02:16.625 --> 02:02:18.734
I'm afraid I can't say.

1534
02:02:19.086 --> 02:02:21.779
She's weak; she's weak all through.

1535
02:02:22.465 --> 02:02:25.074
To be frank, she hasn't the strength.

1536
02:02:25.551 --> 02:02:28.369
And, more important, I doubt
if she even has the will.


1537
02:02:33.559 --> 02:02:35.334
Where is she?

1538
02:02:46.822 --> 02:02:49.599
I think you'd better leave
her now, Mr Machin.


1539
02:03:38.415 --> 02:03:40.608
Margaret.

1540
02:03:42.169 --> 02:03:44.070
Margaret.

1541
02:03:49.468 --> 02:03:51.577
Margaret, it's nothing.

1542
02:03:52.930 --> 02:03:55.331
It's nothing at all.

1543
02:03:57.768 --> 02:03:59.919
It's nothing, Margaret.

1544
02:04:01.355 --> 02:04:03.297
You're all right.

1545
02:04:08.696 --> 02:04:10.888
You're... you're all right.

1546
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:15.643
You're going to be
all right, Margaret.


1547
02:04:19.206 --> 02:04:21.607
You're going to be all right now.

1548
02:04:22.710 --> 02:04:24.652
You're sa fe.

1549
02:04:27.631 --> 02:04:29.448
You're sa fe, Margaret.

1550
02:04:34.263 --> 02:04:35.997
Margaret...

1551
02:04:37.141 --> 02:04:40.501
You... can't go like this.

1552
02:04:41.645 --> 02:04:43.921
You can't leave me.

1553
02:04:46.817 --> 02:04:48.676
You mustn't be mean.

1554
02:04:48.944 --> 02:04:50.720
Margaret.

1555
02:04:54.366 --> 02:04:56.559
Margaret, you can't leave me.

1556
02:04:57.119 --> 02:04:59.020
You can't.

1557
02:05:00.873 --> 02:05:03.274
You mustn't be mean, Margaret.

1558
02:05:57.179 --> 02:05:59.371
Doctor!

1559
02:06:16.699 --> 02:06:18.808
She's gone.

1560
02:06:23.539 --> 02:06:25.397
Sorry.

1561
02:06:35.384 --> 02:06:37.284
No.

1562
02:06:39.930 --> 02:06:49.930
No, she's not.

1563
02:07:12.504 --> 02:07:14.488
No!

1564
02:10:13.644 --> 02:10:23.644
Margaret.

1565
02:11:12.661 --> 02:11:15.396
Oh, Margaret...

1566
02:11:33.849 --> 02:11:36.917
Margaret!

1567
02:12:35.744 --> 02:12:39.730
Come on, Machin,
get a bloody move on!
