3
00:01:56.968 --> 00:01:57.969
Mad Dog.

4
00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:02.182
Homemade feed?

5
00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:10.356
Fish meal, oyster shells, HB 101,
mushrooms-- two types.


6
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.609
Good chicken. Free-range.

7
00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:17.989
Akira Edogawa.

8
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.369
Nadi…

9
00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.331
your brother.

10
00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:33.588
When?

11
00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.007
When what?

12
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.636
You kill.

13
00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:45.058
Akira, five years ago. 
Nadi, last year.

14
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.726
And the other three?

15
00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:48.811
Oh, you know.

16
00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:51.564
You know…

17
00:02:52.774 --> 00:02:56.653
I… out of game now.

18
00:02:56.736 --> 00:03:01.866
Still, though, you must atone.

19
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:04.202
Shorty Jap.

20
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.544
"The woodland lake of Nemi--
Diana's Mirror…


21
00:03:57.797 --> 00:03:59.299
The grove of Aricia…

22
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:16.733
There prowls a priest, 
King of the Wood.

23
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.696
He seeks to kill a man, and…

24
00:04:25.074 --> 00:04:27.577
having killed him,

25
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.539
is soon killed himself."

26
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:38.546
Officer? There's been a murder.

27
00:04:39.422 --> 00:04:43.176
I'm going to a movie.
With Goro Idezuki on Sunday!


28
00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:46.929
You go, girl!

29
00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.184
-I'm jealous.
-I'm nervous!


30
00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:53.394
-Will I be okay?
-You'll be fine.


31
00:04:53.478 --> 00:04:54.729
Do you think so?

32
00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.615
What the…? We can't do this!

33
00:05:05.698 --> 00:05:07.367
Wanna die, too?

34
00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:13.915
POLICE

35
00:05:20.213 --> 00:05:24.592
Urgent! Second Street, Shinjuku!

36
00:05:53.788 --> 00:05:54.831
Chief.

37
00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.668
Mad Dog was killed.

38
00:05:59.502 --> 00:06:03.256
-Witness protection guy?
-A former cop killed him.


39
00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:18.855
-Where is he?
-We drugged him.


40
00:06:19.522 --> 00:06:21.524
-Any trouble?
-Some, during transport.


41
00:06:42.086 --> 00:06:45.548
Goro Idezuki,
a cop in Shinjuku ten years ago.


42
00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:49.760
There was a robbery at a supermarket.

43
00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:53.347
Three girls and a lady working there
were killed.


44
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:58.686
They arrested one guy five years later.
He was never charged.


45
00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:01.439
He was found dead a month later.

46
00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:05.568
Goro Idezuki was AWOL
from Rapid Response Unit 4.


47
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:10.114
Likely been hunting them down.
Killed 'em all.


48
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.036
-I wonder why.
-In love with one of the girls?


49
00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:19.207
Revenge? For a girl
you never even held hands with?


50
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.043
That's dysfunctional, son.

51
00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:48.069
We can give you a second life.
Undercover agent.


52
00:07:48.152 --> 00:07:51.822
-Who is "we"?
-Metropolitan Special Crimes--


53
00:07:51.906 --> 00:07:54.450
-Who are you?
-I'm Chief Anai.


54
00:07:55.117 --> 00:07:57.286
Undercover agent.

55
00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:01.040
Go into Toshokai.

56
00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:04.710
The fifth boss died four years ago.

57
00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:08.506
A war broke out
over who would take over.

58
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:13.427
The Ujiie family,
the "Expelled" vs the Kozu family.


59
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.223
-Remember?
-I was in Mumbai.


60
00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:20.935
It's the biggest family in Kanto,

61
00:08:21.018 --> 00:08:23.771
Non-expansionist yakuza.

62
00:08:23.854 --> 00:08:26.774
Tokyo-based. Cozy with authority.

63
00:08:26.857 --> 00:08:31.237
A former cop mediated the feud.
Kozu became the sixth boss.


64
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.743
<i>He created a legitimate business</i>
<i>as a front, like the mafia.</i>


65
00:08:38.327 --> 00:08:39.829
Go on ahead.

66
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:45.251
<i>No one carried weapons in public.</i>

67
00:08:45.334 --> 00:08:48.045
<i>So, the Expelled snuffed him.</i>

68
00:08:52.675 --> 00:08:56.137
The seventh boss of the family chosen

69
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.391
to lead the revenge wasn't Toki,
or the "Bear," Kumazawa,


70
00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:02.393
or Chuji, the consigliere.

71
00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:03.978
Chuji has no nose?

72
00:09:04.061 --> 00:09:06.772
Bitten off. He wears a sharkskin mask.

73
00:09:06.856 --> 00:09:11.819
Toake, the secretary, was chosen.
A highly unusual selection.


74
00:09:12.403 --> 00:09:17.617
He follows Kozu's ways.
Also supports overseas expansion.


75
00:09:24.498 --> 00:09:28.002
A hybrid unit of the Kozu
and Mikami families.


76
00:09:32.715 --> 00:09:34.216
AKA Hell Dogs.

77
00:09:38.596 --> 00:09:41.265
That's Slick, the Mikami boss.

78
00:09:41.349 --> 00:09:43.976
Toake uses them to fix problems.

79
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.395
His reach abroad has grown.

80
00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:50.566
The top earners are members
in Brazil, Philippines, Uganda--


81
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.902
-Uganda?
-Ivory trade.


82
00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:56.656
Toshokai is involved in elephant poaching.

83
00:09:56.739 --> 00:09:58.074
Hell Dogs is in Bangkok.

84
00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:09.460
That's Muro. Go pick a fight.

85
00:10:09.543 --> 00:10:11.879
Join the Hell Dogs. 
It's your test.

86
00:10:11.962 --> 00:10:13.923
Why him? Why not target the top guy?

87
00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:16.425
You and Slick are oil and water.

88
00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:19.095
This kid and I will get along?

89
00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:23.224
98% work compatibility.
With Slick, under 10%.


90
00:10:23.307 --> 00:10:25.851
The rest are below 50%.

91
00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:27.603
Potential lovebird?

92
00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:31.607
Muro's parents were leaders of Veda.

93
00:10:32.858 --> 00:10:34.068
The cult?

94
00:10:34.652 --> 00:10:37.154
Yes. Executed for mass murder.

95
00:10:39.281 --> 00:10:41.575
Muro is a yakuza psychopath.

96
00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:44.453
Wicked and wild. 
Wants to be a hero.

97
00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:47.248
Same as you. Fighting in the dark.

98
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:50.000
Say we hit it off. What--

99
00:10:50.084 --> 00:10:53.087
Destroy the Expelled. 
Climb the ranks.

100
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.381
-What then?
-And then?


101
00:10:56.465 --> 00:10:58.676
Into the darkness.

102
00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.594
Your contract and passport.

103
00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:05.307
You know the callers in Kabuki-cho?

104
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.061
"Hot girls over here! 
Convenient girls!"

105
00:11:10.062 --> 00:11:12.815
No cop has fallen so low as you.

106
00:11:14.024 --> 00:11:17.278
You're a convenient man, 
Shogo Kanetaka.

107
00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:26.620
SHOGO KANETAKA

108
00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:49.477
Want some, Tak?

109
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.562
-No.
-No?


110
00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:55.858
-No rice balls?
-No.


111
00:11:59.445 --> 00:12:00.863
I'm gassed.

112
00:12:00.946 --> 00:12:02.406
Finally!

113
00:12:24.553 --> 00:12:26.555
I'm gonna kill it today.

114
00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:29.517
I wanna go the hell home.

115
00:12:53.624 --> 00:12:54.667
Which one?

116
00:12:55.918 --> 00:12:57.169
The usual.

117
00:13:06.262 --> 00:13:08.973
-Is that like a ritual?
-What?


118
00:13:09.056 --> 00:13:12.059
Everyday. Take out the toolbox.

119
00:13:12.142 --> 00:13:16.438
Ask me which one. I say the usual.
You line up body bags.


120
00:13:17.523 --> 00:13:19.942
Who knows if they'll come?

121
00:13:20.025 --> 00:13:21.026
I guess.

122
00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:24.238
It's a ritual.

123
00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:26.156
Maybe.

124
00:13:29.034 --> 00:13:30.035
Ready?

125
00:13:50.556 --> 00:13:51.557
Damn!

126
00:13:56.687 --> 00:13:58.564
-And this?
-Maintain this position.


127
00:13:58.647 --> 00:14:00.107
Keep it here, and…

128
00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:12.494
Why?

129
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:15.789
-Elbows tight.
-Elbows tight.


130
00:14:15.873 --> 00:14:19.668
-Make sure to control his hand.
-Control it.


131
00:14:19.752 --> 00:14:21.420
-Squat down.
-Squat. Down.


132
00:14:28.928 --> 00:14:29.929
I did it.

133
00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:32.640
I did it.

134
00:14:33.265 --> 00:14:34.266
You didn't.

135
00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:37.102
It's so hard!

136
00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:40.689
I'm dizzy.

137
00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:44.944
I wanna get this! Here. 
He gets me and…

138
00:14:46.695 --> 00:14:48.072
You're hopeless.

139
00:14:50.574 --> 00:14:54.203
-I'm hungry.
-You had 12 rice balls.


140
00:14:54.286 --> 00:14:55.788
When I was a kid,

141
00:14:55.871 --> 00:14:59.959
I spent six months on IVs
on an empty stomach.


142
00:15:00.042 --> 00:15:01.043
What?

143
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:06.507
My parents were members
of the Veda Revelation.


144
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.760
-Veda, as in--
-Yup. The scary cult.


145
00:15:10.302 --> 00:15:11.762
Never knew that.

146
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:13.847
'Course not.

147
00:15:13.931 --> 00:15:16.767
Only the boss and the Kozu Trio know.

148
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:20.229
Is that from Mr. Jaw?

149
00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:21.730
-They're coming.
-When?


150
00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:24.942
-In 15 minutes.
-Oh, shit!


151
00:15:49.508 --> 00:15:51.677
This will be useful.

152
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.637
How's security?

153
00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:57.766
Airtight. My men are on guard 24-7.

154
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.476
See the amenities?

155
00:16:00.352 --> 00:16:01.854
And the hot springs?

156
00:16:01.937 --> 00:16:03.856
-Not yet.
-I see.


157
00:16:03.939 --> 00:16:07.151
How about golf tomorrow?
Then the hot springs?


158
00:16:07.234 --> 00:16:10.904
But our boss doesn't like to golf.

159
00:16:10.988 --> 00:16:13.657
-Big bro's the only one who's good.
-He's on another level.


160
00:16:13.741 --> 00:16:16.952
-You mean Tiger?
-People call him "Tiger Woods."


161
00:16:17.036 --> 00:16:20.205
-What's here?
-This is the great hall.


162
00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:21.790
Amazing!

163
00:16:21.874 --> 00:16:25.794
Contraband, torture… Perfect for anything.

164
00:16:25.878 --> 00:16:27.796
We can even have a circus.

165
00:16:29.923 --> 00:16:33.010
-It's like from <i>Spartacus</i>.
-How much?


166
00:16:34.386 --> 00:16:37.014
There's more to see over here.

167
00:16:37.097 --> 00:16:38.557
How much?

168
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.267
Just a moment--

169
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.103
Mr. Jaw, you understand…

170
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:02.372
Stop! Please!

171
00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:04.458
Stop. Don't.

172
00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:05.542
I'm sorry, I…

173
00:17:09.797 --> 00:17:11.507
Please, please, don't--

174
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:12.591
Hush.

175
00:17:27.356 --> 00:17:30.984
Crush it… and crush it!

176
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:40.285
There it is.

177
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:43.997
Over here.

178
00:17:44.748 --> 00:17:46.542
You smokin'?

179
00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.794
That a cigarette in your mouth?

180
00:17:48.877 --> 00:17:51.505
-I'm going to school 'em.
-Don't kill 'em.


181
00:17:59.513 --> 00:18:00.597
-Evenin'.
-Evenin'.


182
00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:05.811
They killed our last boss
in a smoking room. Toshokai is now…


183
00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:11.775
a smoke-free workplace.

184
00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:14.111
Hey. Get the body bags.

185
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:15.612
Yes, sir.

186
00:18:16.113 --> 00:18:18.198
-The hole?
-Over there.


187
00:18:19.032 --> 00:18:20.909
-Where?
-There.


188
00:18:22.911 --> 00:18:24.329
I don't see it.

189
00:18:26.331 --> 00:18:27.499
That's it.

190
00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:29.126
It's too small.

191
00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:32.254
Is it? Guess a
van wouldn't fit in it.

192
00:18:33.463 --> 00:18:35.048
You dug your own grave.

193
00:18:39.928 --> 00:18:41.471
Those are your graves.

194
00:18:42.097 --> 00:18:43.807
-I'm sorry. Please.
-See?


195
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:46.226
I don't wanna die.

196
00:18:46.894 --> 00:18:49.605
Look at that. Ain't it somethin'?

197
00:18:50.147 --> 00:18:51.398
Look here.

198
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:55.027
Weather's bad here, isn't it?
Rain, typhoons?


199
00:18:57.404 --> 00:19:00.324
-Right?
-Yes, when it rains, it rains.


200
00:19:01.533 --> 00:19:04.036
You knew that and still did this?

201
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.998
Maybe we should kill 'em. 
Can't trust 'em.

202
00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:14.796
No more than five a day. 
That's my rule.

203
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.885
I killed one. Crushed one.
Still have three today. What do you think?


204
00:19:19.968 --> 00:19:23.305
-We'll dig!
-Three slots left, you know?


205
00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:25.307
We're sorry!

206
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:29.728
Shut up. The jury's still out.
We're deliberating!


207
00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:31.021
Okay, get in.

208
00:19:31.688 --> 00:19:33.065
Get in the hole!

209
00:19:37.653 --> 00:19:39.863
A commemorative photo.

210
00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:40.948
For what?

211
00:19:41.031 --> 00:19:43.659
I'm going to post
this if you fuck up.

212
00:19:43.742 --> 00:19:46.328
-Get rid of the van.
-Yes, sir!


213
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:50.082
You're having fun. Smile. Say cheese.

214
00:20:00.008 --> 00:20:02.219
-I'm going to grab a bite.
-Okay.


215
00:20:11.937 --> 00:20:13.522
Babe?

216
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.858
It's from Tak Boy.

217
00:20:17.442 --> 00:20:20.904
Good timing, Emiri, hop on.

218
00:20:21.405 --> 00:20:22.990
Now?

219
00:20:24.116 --> 00:20:25.784
I was sleeping.

220
00:20:25.867 --> 00:20:27.995
If not now, then when?

221
00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:31.665
This call's about to change my life.

222
00:20:31.748 --> 00:20:36.586
Good news or bad, that phoenix
on your back will comfort me.


223
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.171
Okay.

224
00:20:42.217 --> 00:20:45.053
-<i>Hey.</i>
-Storm's passed.


225
00:20:45.137 --> 00:20:47.431
-<i>Any damage?</i>
-Three houses.


226
00:20:47.514 --> 00:20:48.682
Destroyed?

227
00:20:48.765 --> 00:20:50.392
Nothing left.

228
00:20:50.976 --> 00:20:53.645
Good. Go take a couple of days off.

229
00:20:53.729 --> 00:20:55.063
<i>I'm back tomorrow.</i>

230
00:20:56.148 --> 00:20:57.149
Fine.

231
00:20:59.985 --> 00:21:01.653
Good news?

232
00:21:01.737 --> 00:21:05.657
Yep. Now George is the only one left
of the Expelled.


233
00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:15.083
Sing to me.

234
00:21:27.637 --> 00:21:31.975
KILLED KINA AND TWO OTHERS
DETAILS TO FOLLOW


235
00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:39.024
-Ozu or Kurosawa?
-Ozu.


236
00:21:39.107 --> 00:21:41.151
-Picasso or Van Gogh?
-Picasso.


237
00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:44.988
Is that so? Mars or Jupiter?

238
00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:47.157
Mars.

239
00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:54.289
-<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> or <i>The Wild Bunch</i>?
-<i>Lawrence</i>.


240
00:21:54.373 --> 00:21:58.460
<i>Lawrence?</i> Really?
I mean, it's not bad, but…


241
00:22:00.212 --> 00:22:01.963
Entered it wrong.

242
00:22:02.047 --> 00:22:04.508
No way. Let me try again.

243
00:22:05.384 --> 00:22:07.636
I'm not that stupid.

244
00:22:07.719 --> 00:22:09.304
What the hell?

245
00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:14.810
I did not enter the wrong number.

246
00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:23.110
Nas-teeth!

247
00:22:23.193 --> 00:22:24.569
Go get the door.

248
00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:26.238
Clean up!

249
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:29.366
-Open the door!
-Hurry up!


250
00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:32.369
Hey! Open up!

251
00:22:32.452 --> 00:22:34.663
-Go open the damn door.
-Open it.


252
00:22:34.746 --> 00:22:36.123
You can hear us!

253
00:22:36.748 --> 00:22:37.874
Welcome back.

254
00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:40.585
Be glad it was one kick.

255
00:22:41.378 --> 00:22:42.671
Motherfuckers.

256
00:22:42.754 --> 00:22:44.339
-Nas-teeth.
-Don't.


257
00:22:44.422 --> 00:22:46.383
-Stay outta this.
-In a bad mood today?


258
00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:51.221
We return. The passcode's changed.
We're locked out.


259
00:22:51.304 --> 00:22:55.142
-We risk our lives and this is our reward?
-Calm down.


260
00:22:55.225 --> 00:22:57.310
You probably pushed wrong.

261
00:22:57.394 --> 00:22:59.688
You calling us stupid?

262
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:03.191
No, I'm not. What's going on, Slick?

263
00:23:03.817 --> 00:23:06.194
-It's like MLB.
-What?


264
00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:08.113
Major League Baseball.

265
00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:11.992
They dump a bucket
of Gatorade on the guy

266
00:23:12.075 --> 00:23:14.286
who hit the walk-off grand slam.

267
00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:15.787
Meaning?

268
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:18.165
It's your hero's welcome.

269
00:23:18.248 --> 00:23:20.250
-Then where's the--
-Don't.


270
00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:23.295
-Who do you think you are?
-You little shit.


271
00:23:23.378 --> 00:23:26.673
We snuffed Kina, but George is alive.

272
00:23:26.756 --> 00:23:29.050
Maybe backed by a family in the west.

273
00:23:29.134 --> 00:23:32.554
-We know that.
-Losing sight from your bookkeeping?


274
00:23:32.637 --> 00:23:33.638
Cut it out!

275
00:23:33.722 --> 00:23:37.184
Door's locked because of a damn prank.

276
00:23:37.267 --> 00:23:41.146
We could have been killed by the door,
and the family mocked--


277
00:23:41.229 --> 00:23:42.689
Enough, Muro.

278
00:23:42.772 --> 00:23:45.817
Since when are hit men so important?

279
00:23:46.443 --> 00:23:51.573
Just like when we met in Bangkok, Slick,
you can't see danger.


280
00:23:51.656 --> 00:23:52.699
Tak!

281
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:55.619
-Cut this out!
-Enough already!


282
00:23:55.702 --> 00:23:57.370
Shut the fuck up!

283
00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:08.882
I was dozing off, feeling so relaxed.

284
00:24:09.966 --> 00:24:13.345
Then this noise?
You know I love my barber time.


285
00:24:14.429 --> 00:24:17.265
That chair costs as much as a Lexus.

286
00:24:17.807 --> 00:24:19.893
-Sorry, sir.
-Sorry, sir.


287
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.687
You're saying "sorry" to a yakuza?

288
00:24:24.064 --> 00:24:26.274
What's wrong with you two?

289
00:24:27.275 --> 00:24:30.654
Your big brothers and uncles come out

290
00:24:30.737 --> 00:24:34.491
to welcome you home from the job.

291
00:24:34.991 --> 00:24:37.911
But you bark at
them like a stray dog.

292
00:24:40.664 --> 00:24:42.290
Got a body like a tire.

293
00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:45.252
Perhaps it's time…

294
00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:48.380
Welcome back. Good job.

295
00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:51.800
Yell at me, too, Pops.

296
00:24:51.883 --> 00:24:53.677
Idiot. Clueless as ever.

297
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.971
I can't go unpunished--

298
00:24:56.054 --> 00:24:58.640
It's no fun punching you.

299
00:24:58.723 --> 00:25:00.517
Go donate some blood.

300
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.978
Have Tak fist fuck you.

301
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.481
Now let's go celebrate!

302
00:25:06.564 --> 00:25:08.275
Yes, sir!

303
00:25:08.358 --> 00:25:10.777
-The usual spot.
-Hell yeah!


304
00:25:17.075 --> 00:25:18.535
Good evening.

305
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.838
Welcome.

306
00:25:30.672 --> 00:25:32.507
-This way to your table.
-All right.


307
00:25:39.097 --> 00:25:41.850
Not you. Go somewhere else.

308
00:25:45.729 --> 00:25:47.439
Okay. Hug each other.

309
00:25:48.398 --> 00:25:50.525
Tightly. A good one.

310
00:25:52.652 --> 00:25:53.903
Sit over there.

311
00:25:56.114 --> 00:25:57.490
Not there, Muro.

312
00:25:58.074 --> 00:25:59.326
Over there.

313
00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:00.577
At the end?

314
00:26:01.786 --> 00:26:02.871
Cheers.

315
00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:08.418
-Open your mouth!
-Yes, ma'am.


316
00:26:08.501 --> 00:26:09.544
Wider!

317
00:26:10.128 --> 00:26:13.590
-"<i>Va pensiero, sull'ali dorate</i>."
-Louder!


318
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.386
Sit there.

319
00:26:20.263 --> 00:26:21.598
What's up, Bear?

320
00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:23.767
-<i>Eatin' steak?</i>
-About to.


321
00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:26.686
It's a good place. 
Treat 'em well.

322
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.023
<i>I know. We won't embarrass you.</i>

323
00:26:30.106 --> 00:26:31.649
And afterward?

324
00:26:31.733 --> 00:26:34.694
<i>Maybe karaoke? 
Wanna join?</i>

325
00:26:36.196 --> 00:26:41.326
I'm the secretary to the boss.
Your men would freeze up.


326
00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:42.494
<i>I guess.</i>

327
00:26:43.036 --> 00:26:46.331
Sayo's opening a members-only club.

328
00:26:46.414 --> 00:26:47.415
<i>S and M, right?</i>

329
00:26:47.499 --> 00:26:50.168
Come over tonight-- a dress rehearsal.

330
00:26:52.295 --> 00:26:54.672
-Toki?
-<i>Hey, Sayo.</i>


331
00:26:54.756 --> 00:26:56.758
I can get more girls.

332
00:27:00.512 --> 00:27:03.723
Really? Then maybe I should perform.

333
00:27:07.936 --> 00:27:10.522
This is a sweeter soy sauce,

334
00:27:11.106 --> 00:27:12.816
pairs well with wasabi.

335
00:27:13.316 --> 00:27:14.317
It's good.

336
00:27:16.778 --> 00:27:19.489
Welcome. How do you like your meat?

337
00:27:19.572 --> 00:27:21.408
He likes it very rare.

338
00:27:21.491 --> 00:27:25.245
I had a four-ounce poop.
So, another four-ounce steak.


339
00:27:25.328 --> 00:27:26.454
Very well.

340
00:27:29.249 --> 00:27:31.126
Six months without food?

341
00:27:31.209 --> 00:27:33.753
A human experiment by Veda.

342
00:27:33.837 --> 00:27:35.380
My brain says I'm full.

343
00:27:35.463 --> 00:27:37.882
"I'm hungry" is your mantra.

344
00:27:37.966 --> 00:27:39.634
It makes me human.

345
00:27:39.717 --> 00:27:41.386
You? Human moments?

346
00:27:41.469 --> 00:27:43.763
About four, five times a day.

347
00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:48.852
-Pops.
-What?


348
00:27:48.935 --> 00:27:50.311
I'm done for tonight.

349
00:27:50.395 --> 00:27:54.399
What about the S and M show?
There'll be girls.


350
00:27:54.482 --> 00:27:56.860
Massage over sex. I'm so stiff.

351
00:27:56.943 --> 00:28:00.905
Stick that stiff in a girl,
move it around.


352
00:28:00.989 --> 00:28:03.408
-I'll get a cab.
-I'll get it myself.


353
00:28:03.908 --> 00:28:05.368
-Okay.
-Good night.


354
00:28:05.452 --> 00:28:06.494
Thank you, Pops.

355
00:28:16.463 --> 00:28:18.089
O
-Zez? Is that you?

356
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.967
A four-ounce poop? 
Still the same.

357
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.510
You could've said hi.

358
00:28:22.594 --> 00:28:25.346
Surrounded by all those yakuza? No.

359
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.765
They make you do clean up?

360
00:28:28.516 --> 00:28:30.685
I thought you'd be back.

361
00:28:31.352 --> 00:28:33.188
-You did?
-I did.


362
00:29:02.175 --> 00:29:04.344
Hi, Tak. Long time no see.

363
00:29:04.427 --> 00:29:07.138
-Ms. N available?
-No, but I'll get you in.


364
00:29:07.222 --> 00:29:09.015
Your Japanese improved.

365
00:29:09.098 --> 00:29:11.559
It was never not good.

366
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.280
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


367
00:29:25.031 --> 00:29:26.533
I can't do next week.

368
00:29:26.616 --> 00:29:30.161
-Next week…
-Can we do the week after?


369
00:29:30.245 --> 00:29:32.497
Week after? Let's see.

370
00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:36.334
Then, how about this time?

371
00:29:36.417 --> 00:29:40.171
I am crossing a bridge now.

372
00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:43.675
I don't know what bridge it is.

373
00:29:44.425 --> 00:29:47.720
I think I'll give it a name.

374
00:29:49.055 --> 00:29:53.268
-You came out of Veda normal.
-So are the others.


375
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:54.853
Folks on death row, Z?

376
00:29:54.936 --> 00:29:57.689
-Don't call me Z.
-Why?


377
00:29:57.772 --> 00:30:00.441
-I have a name.
-O-Zez.


378
00:30:00.525 --> 00:30:02.819
-You forgot my name?
-Who cares?


379
00:30:02.902 --> 00:30:03.903
Hello.

380
00:30:03.987 --> 00:30:05.405
-Boyfriend?
-Yep!


381
00:30:05.488 --> 00:30:06.489
-He's not.
-I'm Muro.


382
00:30:06.573 --> 00:30:08.575
-He's not.
-I'm Nobana.


383
00:30:08.658 --> 00:30:10.034
-Huh?
-Nobana.


384
00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:11.119
He's not.

385
00:30:11.202 --> 00:30:13.580
-What would you like?
-Two coffees.


386
00:30:13.663 --> 00:30:14.998
-That's my seat.
-Here?


387
00:30:15.081 --> 00:30:16.082
Yeah, switch.

388
00:30:16.165 --> 00:30:17.917
-Your seat?
-It's my seat.


389
00:30:20.545 --> 00:30:23.923
Delts, glutes, legs,
all stiff on the right.


390
00:30:24.007 --> 00:30:26.968
Most yakuza damage their liver.

391
00:30:27.051 --> 00:30:29.262
-Is it bad?
-Really bad.


392
00:30:29.762 --> 00:30:32.807
Where'd you get your sixth sense?

393
00:30:33.391 --> 00:30:36.185
Half the masseuses have it.

394
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:39.731
Bad energy crawls up our arms.

395
00:30:40.523 --> 00:30:44.736
Disease and demons. 
Yours is a demon.

396
00:30:45.445 --> 00:30:48.865
I need to rest five minutes for every ten.
Otherwise,


397
00:30:49.908 --> 00:30:51.951
it'll get me too.

398
00:31:04.422 --> 00:31:05.924
O
-Zez?

399
00:31:06.007 --> 00:31:07.091
It's Anna.

400
00:31:07.592 --> 00:31:11.054
Kids with a past, reunited. 
Let's hook up.

401
00:31:11.971 --> 00:31:13.598
Not with a yakuza.

402
00:31:13.681 --> 00:31:16.601
You blew me when
I was a little wiener.

403
00:31:16.684 --> 00:31:17.977
-I did not!
-You did.


404
00:31:18.061 --> 00:31:19.062
Stop it.

405
00:31:19.145 --> 00:31:21.481
-You went to town!
-I did not!


406
00:31:21.564 --> 00:31:23.775
-All over it!
-Over what?


407
00:31:23.858 --> 00:31:25.735
Wanna know? Sit down.

408
00:31:25.818 --> 00:31:26.903
No, don't.

409
00:31:26.986 --> 00:31:28.071
Coffee?

410
00:31:30.156 --> 00:31:31.699
-Ouch!
-It's nothing.


411
00:31:31.783 --> 00:31:36.037
She was all over me.
You know what that means--


412
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.957
-Who cares? We were young.
-Hey, shut up.


413
00:31:44.796 --> 00:31:46.339
New password.

414
00:31:48.007 --> 00:31:52.136
"0402bowling."

415
00:31:55.139 --> 00:31:56.808
Why do you swallow it?

416
00:31:56.891 --> 00:31:59.102
Just rip it up and toss it.

417
00:31:59.185 --> 00:32:01.479
How did you end up an agent?

418
00:32:02.063 --> 00:32:04.399
Like I said, I can't tell you.

419
00:32:04.482 --> 00:32:06.526
-You know my story.
-Yes.


420
00:32:06.609 --> 00:32:09.237
You gotta give me something.

421
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.488
Hands up.

422
00:32:14.993 --> 00:32:17.912
You make home visits to Chuji?

423
00:32:17.996 --> 00:32:19.497
Yep. Once a week.

424
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:23.584
He has 'em too?

425
00:32:25.128 --> 00:32:27.213
Of course he does.

426
00:32:27.964 --> 00:32:29.298
But…

427
00:32:30.508 --> 00:32:32.135
not as bad as yours.

428
00:32:34.262 --> 00:32:38.016
Did Chief order you to go?

429
00:32:38.099 --> 00:32:41.310
Oh, no. I've known him much longer.

430
00:32:41.394 --> 00:32:43.855
-Before he lost his nose?
-Yes.


431
00:32:47.233 --> 00:32:51.863
I'm living by the code of the survivor.
Just like you.


432
00:32:56.784 --> 00:32:59.996
Toshokai killed my son.

433
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.081
Here. Upstairs.

434
00:33:12.884 --> 00:33:14.218
Wow.

435
00:33:15.094 --> 00:33:16.679
This is it.

436
00:33:16.763 --> 00:33:20.641
It's kinda like the Veda days.

437
00:33:20.725 --> 00:33:24.437
Kitchen for a large family.
You even have a pyramid.


438
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.814
Wounds heal faster in there.

439
00:33:27.315 --> 00:33:30.068
-Like our parents said?
-We're not them.


440
00:33:30.151 --> 00:33:31.819
Scary.

441
00:33:33.321 --> 00:33:36.282
I have three other hideouts like this.

442
00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:37.366
Why?

443
00:33:37.867 --> 00:33:42.455
If I'm hurt, I want a pyramid
wherever I need to hide.


444
00:33:42.538 --> 00:33:44.332
I don't get it.

445
00:33:46.209 --> 00:33:48.669
You make a lot of money.

446
00:33:48.753 --> 00:33:52.340
I have enough.
No one knows about this place.


447
00:33:52.423 --> 00:33:55.510
No one's been here.
It's the cleanest place I got.


448
00:33:55.593 --> 00:33:56.844
And it's my favorite.

449
00:33:59.889 --> 00:34:02.642
-Why do you have a shrine in here?
-Cool, right?


450
00:34:04.936 --> 00:34:06.521
-Pops?
-Where you at?


451
00:34:07.105 --> 00:34:08.106
At my massage.

452
00:34:08.856 --> 00:34:10.691
<i>Can you be here in 30 minutes?</i>

453
00:34:10.775 --> 00:34:13.528
Yes. The party's over?

454
00:34:14.779 --> 00:34:17.824
<i>Got some curious intel. 
Come over.</i>

455
00:34:19.784 --> 00:34:21.244
You look worried.

456
00:34:21.327 --> 00:34:24.205
He never asks me to come this late.

457
00:34:24.288 --> 00:34:26.707
As if he's considerate.

458
00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:28.835
It's happened once before.

459
00:34:28.918 --> 00:34:30.795
And it wasn't good.

460
00:34:30.878 --> 00:34:34.966
He asked me about killing
an undercover-- a narc.


461
00:34:35.967 --> 00:34:38.052
A narcotics agent?

462
00:34:38.136 --> 00:34:42.265
He was in charge
of trafficking drugs for Slick.


463
00:34:43.015 --> 00:34:48.062
A devil's job-- made mules swallow
condoms full of drugs.


464
00:34:48.146 --> 00:34:51.858
He looked evil.
I had no idea he was a narc.


465
00:34:51.941 --> 00:34:53.234
Chief told me.

466
00:34:53.317 --> 00:34:58.406
Toshokai works with a big IT company
on facial recognition.


467
00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:01.534
The authorities have been stripped naked.

468
00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:05.371
They're vulnerable,
including their families.


469
00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:12.587
Did you kill the narc?

470
00:35:15.756 --> 00:35:17.550
I asked to do it.

471
00:35:20.469 --> 00:35:22.180
I had to.

472
00:35:28.853 --> 00:35:32.773
Slick's men carried it out.
I think I was tested.


473
00:35:36.611 --> 00:35:38.029
You'll be fine.

474
00:35:38.988 --> 00:35:42.700
You won't be exposed. 
I'm 99.99% certain.

475
00:35:43.284 --> 00:35:45.077
That's not 100%.

476
00:35:45.161 --> 00:35:49.707
There's always a hole
with humans involved.


477
00:35:50.291 --> 00:35:53.836
-Fuckin' George surfaced in LA.
-With who?


478
00:35:54.545 --> 00:35:57.882
Yusuf Abu Khalil.
Lebanese American broker.


479
00:35:58.466 --> 00:36:01.636
-Deals anything from sex to hit men.
-These pics?


480
00:36:01.719 --> 00:36:06.182
Taken by a person in my network.
Been missing ever since.


481
00:36:06.265 --> 00:36:08.059
He was dead at home.

482
00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:10.269
Job of a pro.

483
00:36:10.353 --> 00:36:12.605
-Tantalizing.
-Right?


484
00:36:15.358 --> 00:36:17.151
-What's my job?
-Bodyguard.


485
00:36:17.235 --> 00:36:18.986
-For you?
-Further up.


486
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.112
-You mean--
-Yep.


487
00:36:20.196 --> 00:36:21.447
He has his team.

488
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:25.201
-You and Muro are our family's best.
-True.


489
00:36:25.284 --> 00:36:26.285
Too much for you?

490
00:36:27.995 --> 00:36:30.164
We're not business-minded.

491
00:36:30.998 --> 00:36:32.750
It's fighting we're good at.

492
00:36:38.172 --> 00:36:39.966
I can't believe you!

493
00:36:40.049 --> 00:36:41.509
Felt good, right?

494
00:36:42.009 --> 00:36:43.928
Did you have to pull out?

495
00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:46.681
But it felt good, didn't it?

496
00:36:46.764 --> 00:36:48.015
Did you cum inside?

497
00:36:48.599 --> 00:36:49.850
Nope.

498
00:36:50.351 --> 00:36:52.728
I shoot blanks. No sperm.

499
00:36:53.229 --> 00:36:54.981
-Always?
-Yeah.


500
00:36:56.023 --> 00:36:57.441
Since forever.

501
00:37:02.571 --> 00:37:04.657
You'll make a good bum.

502
00:37:05.449 --> 00:37:06.784
A good bum?

503
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.156
ASSIGNMENT FROM POPS

504
00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:48.868
BODYGUARD FOR MR. X
USUAL PARTNER


505
00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:28.783
Did you pick the lock?

506
00:38:29.367 --> 00:38:32.161
It was easy. My dad's a locksmith.

507
00:38:32.244 --> 00:38:34.038
We shouldn't do this.

508
00:38:34.121 --> 00:38:36.290
Do this? Like this?

509
00:38:38.626 --> 00:38:41.087
I told you. I'm free after 3 a.m.

510
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.090
Pops may be asleep, but the others…

511
00:38:44.924 --> 00:38:47.593
Don't worry. I'm careful.

512
00:38:47.676 --> 00:38:49.178
It's dangerous.

513
00:38:49.261 --> 00:38:51.472
Don't be cold. I might tell.

514
00:38:57.311 --> 00:39:00.147
Sex on a tightrope. I love it.

515
00:39:17.915 --> 00:39:19.750
-Mornin', ma'am.
-Mornin', ma'am.


516
00:39:21.085 --> 00:39:23.421
-I'll carry it.
-What's your name?


517
00:39:23.504 --> 00:39:25.756
-Fall.
-Since when?


518
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.174
Since I was born.

519
00:39:27.842 --> 00:39:30.261
And they're Spring and Summer?

520
00:39:30.344 --> 00:39:31.595
That's right.

521
00:40:14.013 --> 00:40:15.514
You can go, Mole.

522
00:40:20.978 --> 00:40:23.022
How are you feeling?

523
00:40:23.105 --> 00:40:24.815
My back is sore.

524
00:40:25.816 --> 00:40:29.445
-Let's have a look.
-Yes.


525
00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:33.824
I can never get used to him.

526
00:40:33.908 --> 00:40:34.909
To who?

527
00:40:36.202 --> 00:40:37.536
Mole.

528
00:40:39.121 --> 00:40:41.916
He's my shadow. 
He watches my health.

529
00:40:42.666 --> 00:40:44.251
Watches your health?

530
00:40:44.335 --> 00:40:46.837
He analyzes my bowl every morning.

531
00:40:47.338 --> 00:40:49.757
-The bowl?
-My poop.


532
00:41:06.815 --> 00:41:08.108
Go, go!

533
00:41:08.859 --> 00:41:10.694
-Go spar, Bear.
-Too old.


534
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.868
Good, good!

535
00:41:22.623 --> 00:41:23.958
Take that!

536
00:41:29.755 --> 00:41:30.965
Behind you.

537
00:41:36.845 --> 00:41:39.056
-All right!
-Take a break!


538
00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:44.436
Chuji, this is Tak from our family.
You've met him before.


539
00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.521
Hello, sir.

540
00:41:46.105 --> 00:41:47.314
And this kid?

541
00:41:48.023 --> 00:41:50.192
Muro. You forget already?

542
00:41:50.276 --> 00:41:53.612
Muro… Muro.
Your parents were on death row.


543
00:41:54.488 --> 00:41:56.532
Smooth skin, college boy.

544
00:41:56.615 --> 00:42:00.411
Go easy on him.
I want them to do security.


545
00:42:00.494 --> 00:42:03.872
That's no good. 
I want my Beasts to do it.

546
00:42:04.456 --> 00:42:06.250
Your Beasts?

547
00:42:06.834 --> 00:42:08.627
Mine are Hell Dogs.

548
00:42:08.711 --> 00:42:11.630
Let 'em fight. 
The winner gets the job.

549
00:42:17.094 --> 00:42:20.389
-My guys can leave. And clean up.
-Yes, sir!


550
00:42:21.682 --> 00:42:23.058
Clean up!

551
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.604
Selection complete.

552
00:42:26.687 --> 00:42:28.314
-Now lift.
-Yes, sir.


553
00:42:46.081 --> 00:42:49.168
Teru, Baz, put a vest on those two.

554
00:42:50.544 --> 00:42:52.630
Put it on, get in the ring.

555
00:43:04.725 --> 00:43:07.478
Stand in a line facing me.

556
00:43:10.272 --> 00:43:11.815
You're Team Japan.

557
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:17.488
You're listening to the national anthem.
Hum along if you like.


558
00:43:22.326 --> 00:43:23.410
Pray!

559
00:43:33.045 --> 00:43:34.713
Start on the whistle.

560
00:43:37.216 --> 00:43:38.801
Now fight!

561
00:43:38.884 --> 00:43:42.638
You were shot shielding me.
The shooting continues.


562
00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:44.431
Get off the floor!

563
00:43:45.641 --> 00:43:46.934
Fight.

564
00:43:48.268 --> 00:43:50.187
-Fight!
-Muro.


565
00:43:59.238 --> 00:44:00.239
Get up.

566
00:44:01.407 --> 00:44:02.533
Fight.

567
00:44:03.325 --> 00:44:04.451
Fight!

568
00:44:04.535 --> 00:44:05.619
Hey, Muro.

569
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.038
I said fight!

570
00:44:10.582 --> 00:44:11.834
Muro!

571
00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:27.975
Not me, not me.

572
00:44:35.899 --> 00:44:39.153
Get 'em! Good, good!

573
00:44:42.364 --> 00:44:43.782
I give up!

574
00:44:43.866 --> 00:44:45.284
How did you get up?

575
00:44:48.495 --> 00:44:49.496
Ouch!

576
00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.416
Key card to the penthouse and your ID.

577
00:44:53.292 --> 00:44:56.086
Easy days are over. Get ready.

578
00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.755
Please handle us with care.

579
00:44:59.882 --> 00:45:02.301
It's all out of love, Muro.

580
00:45:02.384 --> 00:45:03.385
Ouch!

581
00:45:05.929 --> 00:45:08.307
Meeting upstairs after you're done.

582
00:45:09.558 --> 00:45:13.103
There's more to this job
than being a shield.


583
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.658
My jewels. Balls one and two.

584
00:45:29.161 --> 00:45:30.537
Ladies?

585
00:45:32.372 --> 00:45:35.042
Boss's office is around the back.

586
00:45:35.125 --> 00:45:37.753
You stand by here.

587
00:45:40.547 --> 00:45:42.216
Sign these papers.

588
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.179
You're centurions.
There are tons of rules.


589
00:45:47.262 --> 00:45:49.139
-Centu--
-Roman captains.


590
00:45:49.723 --> 00:45:50.849
Roman…?

591
00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:57.523
Always carry bulletproof vests
and briefcases. You are his shield.


592
00:45:57.606 --> 00:46:00.692
Car doors are… reinforced.

593
00:46:00.776 --> 00:46:04.863
No accessories that look yakuza.
No gaudy ties.


594
00:46:04.947 --> 00:46:09.451
Unplanned funerals happen.
Wear dark suits, carry prayer beads.


595
00:46:09.535 --> 00:46:13.580
Report anything suspicious by radio,
however small.


596
00:46:13.664 --> 00:46:17.960
Use private SMS with Mr. Bear.
Keep him updated.


597
00:46:18.043 --> 00:46:19.836
Be careful driving.

598
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.048
Cops will try to bust you for anything.

599
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:25.592
Wear your seat belt. 
Headset at all times.

600
00:46:25.676 --> 00:46:27.886
No heavy drinking that cause hangovers.

601
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:30.931
President despises body odor.
We have spare shirts here.


602
00:46:31.014 --> 00:46:33.809
Basically, two days on, two days off.

603
00:46:33.892 --> 00:46:36.436
-So, there's another team?
-Right.


604
00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.189
We didn't beat the A
-Team?

605
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.526
Nope. They're still on detail.

606
00:46:42.609 --> 00:46:43.944
-Can we meet them?
-No.


607
00:46:44.027 --> 00:46:47.322
-So, no shared info between teams?
-None. Per the boss.


608
00:46:47.406 --> 00:46:50.867
We're the subs
so the A-Team gets their rest.


609
00:46:51.618 --> 00:46:53.579
A
-Team members can tell the type

610
00:46:53.662 --> 00:46:58.417
of gun you're carrying,
just by how you move. Scary.


611
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.627
Not the type.

612
00:47:00.711 --> 00:47:03.171
Oh, but they can.

613
00:47:12.764 --> 00:47:14.182
Let's go.

614
00:48:04.483 --> 00:48:06.693
We have Neo
-Episteme today.

615
00:48:06.777 --> 00:48:11.782
At 5 p.m., with Mr. Dawson
of the International Evangelical Alliance.


616
00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:16.244
What's illicit business for yakuza?

617
00:48:16.828 --> 00:48:18.705
GIRL STRANGLED
MAN SENTENCED TO LIFE


618
00:48:21.541 --> 00:48:24.252
Seven-year old girl kidnapped,

619
00:48:24.836 --> 00:48:27.422
raped, killed and dismembered.

620
00:48:29.174 --> 00:48:33.679
No premeditation,
so the court spared the man's life.


621
00:48:33.762 --> 00:48:36.556
"Death penalty not inevitable."

622
00:48:37.307 --> 00:48:42.104
Tenth case a jury's recommendation
has been rejected.


623
00:48:43.939 --> 00:48:46.733
-Tak.
-Sir?


624
00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.821
Any thoughts?

625
00:48:51.405 --> 00:48:55.784
Does yakuza's illicit business…
include fighting for justice?


626
00:48:55.867 --> 00:48:57.661
Who do you judge?

627
00:48:57.744 --> 00:48:59.413
The killer, for sure.

628
00:48:59.913 --> 00:49:04.543
I'd judge the judge
who said it was "not inevitable."


629
00:49:05.127 --> 00:49:06.670
Totally agree.

630
00:49:06.753 --> 00:49:08.380
Shut up, Muro.

631
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:12.676
Good team. It was a good game.

632
00:49:12.759 --> 00:49:14.010
It was.

633
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:17.764
I'm excited for a change.

634
00:49:25.272 --> 00:49:27.399
You might save me from boredom.

635
00:49:30.193 --> 00:49:31.194
I hope you do.

636
00:50:14.905 --> 00:50:16.364
-Prayer beads.
-Prayer beads.


637
00:50:16.865 --> 00:50:17.866
Prayer beads.

638
00:50:29.085 --> 00:50:33.548
You're hogging
the water supply up north, Ms. Chao.


639
00:51:11.086 --> 00:51:14.631
<i>Toake is disciplined like a businessman.</i>

640
00:51:18.885 --> 00:51:23.181
<i>Except he meets people</i>
<i>who have bodyguards.</i>


641
00:51:24.432 --> 00:51:26.101
<i>There's always pat downs.</i>

642
00:51:28.019 --> 00:51:29.729
<i>He enjoys museums.</i>

643
00:51:35.193 --> 00:51:38.822
<i>He has four cars.</i>
<i>Not a single Tokyo plate.</i>


644
00:51:42.576 --> 00:51:44.995
<i>Ten of his men live at his house.</i>

645
00:51:45.912 --> 00:51:48.582
<i>Our day ends at his front door.</i>

646
00:51:54.421 --> 00:51:56.548
<i>Always tips us 40,000 to 50,000 yen.</i>

647
00:52:07.684 --> 00:52:10.145
<i>The ritual yesterday was strange.</i>

648
00:52:56.650 --> 00:52:58.860
This place was going to be a restaurant.

649
00:52:59.986 --> 00:53:01.154
Chinese?

650
00:53:06.034 --> 00:53:11.957
Our old boss was building
a resort for yakuza where he'd retire.


651
00:53:15.502 --> 00:53:16.586
A prayer spa.

652
00:53:25.679 --> 00:53:29.099
"The woodland lake of Aricia.
Diana's Mirror."


653
00:53:29.849 --> 00:53:32.102
Bear, let's pray.

654
00:53:32.185 --> 00:53:33.520
<i>Sì, Capo.</i>

655
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.100
Mythology Hall.

656
00:54:12.851 --> 00:54:14.310
<i>Corpus Mythorum.</i>

657
00:54:14.394 --> 00:54:17.647
I'll kill George,
then finish this project.


658
00:54:26.531 --> 00:54:28.366
-Is he gay?
-Don't know.


659
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:31.369
-Old boss's lover.
-Just worshipped him.


660
00:54:32.078 --> 00:54:33.288
No woman?

661
00:54:33.371 --> 00:54:35.623
His chauffeur told me…

662
00:54:35.707 --> 00:54:37.959
No women allowed in here.

663
00:54:38.043 --> 00:54:40.462
-He got no women?
-No one regular.


664
00:54:40.545 --> 00:54:42.756
-Dudes?
-He's not gay.


665
00:54:42.839 --> 00:54:46.051
You sure? Have you noticed
the way he looks at Tak?


666
00:54:46.134 --> 00:54:47.844
See? He wants you.

667
00:54:47.927 --> 00:54:49.012
Please--

668
00:54:49.095 --> 00:54:52.891
Sounds like you can get intel
from the driver.


669
00:54:52.974 --> 00:54:56.144
Don't. He wants you to bite.

670
00:54:56.811 --> 00:54:58.813
Toake's having him talk?

671
00:54:58.897 --> 00:55:02.275
He's careful-- it's a test.
Don't ask questions.


672
00:55:02.358 --> 00:55:04.736
Muro was asking the questions.

673
00:55:05.361 --> 00:55:08.073
He can ask. You just listen.

674
00:55:08.156 --> 00:55:10.116
What's the emergency?

675
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.203
Celebrating a promotion? See ya.

676
00:55:13.286 --> 00:55:15.080
Stay. We'll go to the roof.

677
00:55:15.997 --> 00:55:18.792
Why are you so mopey?

678
00:55:19.334 --> 00:55:20.960
I'll come later.

679
00:55:21.044 --> 00:55:22.921
You gotta meet everyone.

680
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:27.050
-I don't know…
-Don't worry, they're cool.


681
00:55:27.133 --> 00:55:28.510
We're almost there.

682
00:55:29.552 --> 00:55:30.553
Here we are.

683
00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.892
-There's so many people.
-You're fine.


684
00:55:37.977 --> 00:55:40.105
Hey, it's Anna!

685
00:55:40.188 --> 00:55:41.397
Hey!

686
00:55:42.232 --> 00:55:44.442
-Your boyfriend?
-Who's this?


687
00:55:44.526 --> 00:55:46.820
This is Hideki Murooka.

688
00:55:49.197 --> 00:55:50.907
I'm Kyoko.

689
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:52.200
Nice to meet you.

690
00:55:52.283 --> 00:55:53.952
Muro, remember me?

691
00:55:54.035 --> 00:55:57.372
-Hey! Nobana, right?
-That's right.


692
00:55:57.455 --> 00:56:00.750
Toake has the police by the balls.

693
00:56:00.834 --> 00:56:02.085
How so?

694
00:56:02.168 --> 00:56:04.629
Incriminating files on higher-ups.

695
00:56:04.712 --> 00:56:06.381
Toake's computer.

696
00:56:07.465 --> 00:56:10.343
-Steal it.
-It's fingerprint ID.


697
00:56:11.344 --> 00:56:12.387
"Gummy finger."

698
00:56:13.179 --> 00:56:15.932
It's got his index finger printed on it.

699
00:56:16.015 --> 00:56:20.103
Tested 100 times on an identical box.

700
00:56:20.186 --> 00:56:22.897
-And the scandal?
-Can't say it. It's classified.


701
00:56:22.981 --> 00:56:25.108
How did you get the print?

702
00:56:25.191 --> 00:56:26.901
There's a file on Toshokai.

703
00:56:26.985 --> 00:56:29.737
He has no criminal record
and he always wears gloves.


704
00:56:29.821 --> 00:56:31.072
We had chances.

705
00:56:31.865 --> 00:56:35.535
I'm done as an undercover if I do this.
I'll lose my income.


706
00:56:35.618 --> 00:56:37.620
You have 24 hours after he dies.

707
00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:42.792
50% chance I'm there if he's attacked.

708
00:56:42.876 --> 00:56:45.003
More likely I'll die first.

709
00:56:45.086 --> 00:56:48.131
Protect yourself, let him die.

710
00:56:48.214 --> 00:56:49.883
Easy for you to say.

711
00:56:49.966 --> 00:56:51.259
-Ready?
-Do it.


712
00:56:51.342 --> 00:56:52.677
Revolution!

713
00:56:54.762 --> 00:56:56.764
-No way.
-Bummer!


714
00:56:56.848 --> 00:56:58.057
Success.

715
00:56:58.141 --> 00:56:59.142
Last one!

716
00:56:59.767 --> 00:57:01.227
I'm out.

717
00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.190
Last one.

718
00:57:09.944 --> 00:57:12.071
What group is this?

719
00:57:12.155 --> 00:57:14.157
-What do you think?
-Guess.


720
00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.326
-You're a choir.
-A choir!


721
00:57:16.826 --> 00:57:17.827
No?

722
00:57:18.536 --> 00:57:20.163
Knew it.

723
00:57:25.251 --> 00:57:28.046
You're behind George's actions.

724
00:57:28.588 --> 00:57:30.173
No comment.

725
00:57:30.256 --> 00:57:32.091
I'm a bodyguard.

726
00:57:32.175 --> 00:57:35.845
I'm going to kill anyone
who comes after Toake.


727
00:57:35.929 --> 00:57:37.347
To an extent.

728
00:57:41.643 --> 00:57:43.937
Double my risk benefit.

729
00:57:44.521 --> 00:57:45.647
Copy that.

730
00:57:48.775 --> 00:57:51.986
Twelve members of the same jury.

731
00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:53.279
Close!

732
00:57:54.405 --> 00:57:55.907
Right idea.

733
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:57.951
-Right idea?
-But wrong.


734
00:57:58.034 --> 00:57:59.035
But I'm wrong.

735
00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.164
It's Tak who killed the narc.

736
00:58:03.248 --> 00:58:04.249
I know.

737
00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:10.505
If I'm exposed
and they tell him to kill me, would he?


738
00:58:11.297 --> 00:58:12.715
I need a massage.

739
00:58:14.634 --> 00:58:15.969
A massage.

740
00:58:17.345 --> 00:58:19.806
He's a fiend about money.

741
00:58:19.889 --> 00:58:23.476
We pay him and
he withdraws it right away.

742
00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.228
What for?

743
00:58:25.311 --> 00:58:27.230
Why not look into it?

744
00:58:27.313 --> 00:58:30.400
No manpower. It's not critical.

745
00:58:30.483 --> 00:58:32.986
He does his job. He's liked.

746
00:58:34.112 --> 00:58:35.738
Saving for retirement?

747
00:58:36.698 --> 00:58:38.324
There won't be one.

748
00:58:41.077 --> 00:58:44.330
Tak is living in medieval times.

749
00:58:45.248 --> 00:58:47.834
In that he's free of the law.

750
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.421
He wants a transfigured life.

751
00:58:51.504 --> 00:58:55.842
He's ready to die for beauty,
like in the old days.


752
00:58:56.342 --> 00:58:58.011
Same as Toshokai.

753
00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.346
No, it's not.

754
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:04.642
Toshokai is a bond of men.
His is for all genders.


755
00:59:05.685 --> 00:59:09.772
My arms can feel it
when I work on his body.


756
00:59:10.315 --> 00:59:13.443
Who's been called a murderer's kid?

757
00:59:16.279 --> 00:59:17.322
For real?

758
00:59:17.405 --> 00:59:19.449
Who's related to a victim?

759
00:59:22.327 --> 00:59:24.287
Wait, what?

760
00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:29.000
A convict can be helped,
but their family gets no help.


761
00:59:29.083 --> 00:59:31.002
Always apologizing…

762
00:59:31.085 --> 00:59:33.963
We want to help others in our life.

763
00:59:34.047 --> 00:59:38.426
It's not hypocrisy,
and I've wanted a like-minded group.


764
00:59:39.093 --> 00:59:43.473
We've been through so much
that we understand pain deeply.


765
00:59:43.556 --> 00:59:45.975
-So true.
-Well said.


766
00:59:47.352 --> 00:59:49.896
Jaco was on a documentary on TV.

767
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.692
I didn't want to be like my parents.
I laid myself open on TV.


768
00:59:54.776 --> 00:59:58.863
Talked about creating space
for people like us.


769
00:59:58.946 --> 01:00:01.324
Then, Anna and Duck called.

770
01:00:01.407 --> 01:00:03.451
-Me too.
-You were later.


771
01:00:03.534 --> 01:00:04.535
-Yep.
-I was?


772
01:00:04.619 --> 01:00:08.164
Then, we connected
with the Victims Families Group.


773
01:00:08.247 --> 01:00:12.210
You'll fall low if you're not needed
by someone.


774
01:00:14.545 --> 01:00:16.047
What?

775
01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:17.882
Stop, guys.

776
01:00:17.965 --> 01:00:19.801
No, I didn't mean to--

777
01:00:21.511 --> 01:00:22.637
So hot!

778
01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.721
Yours?

779
01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:26.641
Want a good time?

780
01:00:28.643 --> 01:00:30.520
My God, you're so cute.

781
01:00:30.603 --> 01:00:31.604
Drink with me.

782
01:00:31.688 --> 01:00:33.773
Nari, look, look! 
Isn't that Tak?

783
01:00:33.856 --> 01:00:35.858
Next time. Bye.

784
01:00:43.074 --> 01:00:45.702
POLICE

785
01:00:46.285 --> 01:00:47.954
Something's strange.

786
01:00:48.037 --> 01:00:49.288
Like what?

787
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:53.543
Six months ago,
I got an envelope full of cash.


788
01:00:55.002 --> 01:00:57.505
Inside it was 200K and a note saying,

789
01:00:58.089 --> 01:01:00.174
"The killers have paid."

790
01:01:00.258 --> 01:01:01.634
From who?

791
01:01:01.718 --> 01:01:03.136
Only said "G.I."

792
01:01:03.219 --> 01:01:04.220
Foreigner?

793
01:01:05.138 --> 01:01:07.181
-Bogus address.
-And then?


794
01:01:07.265 --> 01:01:10.059
Every two months,
I get another 200,000 yen.


795
01:01:10.143 --> 01:01:11.227
-What?
-200,000 yen?


796
01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.688
-Any notes?
-Not since the first.


797
01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:16.482
Your mom died 12, 13 years ago?

798
01:01:16.566 --> 01:01:18.359
Eleven. I know the date.

799
01:01:18.443 --> 01:01:21.863
July 30th, 9:40 p.m.
Three men robbed a supermarket--


800
01:01:21.946 --> 01:01:24.407
-No details!
-I know, no details.


801
01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:28.661
They killed my mom
and three high school girls.


802
01:01:29.746 --> 01:01:31.289
My dad killed himself.

803
01:01:33.124 --> 01:01:36.294
I went to the victims' families
about the money.


804
01:01:36.377 --> 01:01:38.087
-To Mr. Mamiya?
-Yes.


805
01:01:38.171 --> 01:01:39.714
One of the girls was his.

806
01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:43.718
They all got the same cash and note.

807
01:01:44.552 --> 01:01:46.929
Did they know who G.I. was?

808
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:52.393
Mr. Mamiya remembered a cop
from the 2nd Street station.


809
01:01:52.477 --> 01:01:54.103
Goro Idezuki.

810
01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:56.439
Initials are "G.I."

811
01:01:56.522 --> 01:01:58.149
A cop avenged them?

812
01:01:58.232 --> 01:02:01.110
And he's also a benefactor? No way.

813
01:02:01.194 --> 01:02:03.237
X-factor benefactor?

814
01:02:03.321 --> 01:02:06.199
Stop with the dad joke.

815
01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:10.244
-Okay, okay, hear me out.
-Listen, guys.


816
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:12.622
Suppose I was that cop.

817
01:02:12.705 --> 01:02:14.540
It was on my turf.

818
01:02:14.624 --> 01:02:17.585
Maybe I saw the men earlier.

819
01:02:17.668 --> 01:02:21.172
Like, "What if I'd stopped them?"

820
01:02:21.255 --> 01:02:23.007
-Gotta atone.
-Exactly.


821
01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:25.802
So, he spends a decade hunting them?

822
01:02:25.885 --> 01:02:27.553
-Eleven years.
-No way.


823
01:02:27.637 --> 01:02:29.055
It's possible.

824
01:02:29.138 --> 01:02:33.142
But, listen!
How dope if it were true, right?


825
01:02:33.226 --> 01:02:36.521
"If." I'm saying if it were true.

826
01:02:36.604 --> 01:02:38.731
-He's murdering.
-That's badass.


827
01:02:38.815 --> 01:02:41.067
Who cares? They killed, too.

828
01:02:44.695 --> 01:02:46.239
What a fun night.

829
01:02:46.823 --> 01:02:47.949
Idezuki!

830
01:02:49.075 --> 01:02:51.369
Hey, Goro! Goro!

831
01:02:51.452 --> 01:02:53.204
Here he is.

832
01:02:53.287 --> 01:02:55.748
Call me? Oh. No! 
Don't do that!

833
01:02:55.832 --> 01:02:58.376
-Goro?
-Where?


834
01:02:58.459 --> 01:03:00.169
Careful. Careful.

835
01:03:00.837 --> 01:03:03.297
Wait, wait. What's going on?

836
01:03:03.381 --> 01:03:06.342
-Here he is!
-Don't use my real name!


837
01:03:07.134 --> 01:03:08.678
Goro's right here!

838
01:03:09.262 --> 01:03:13.349
Careful. Stand back, please.

839
01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:16.727
Hey, I'm Johnny!

840
01:03:26.612 --> 01:03:28.531
I bet you're right.

841
01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:30.658
The cop on 2nd Street.

842
01:03:31.367 --> 01:03:35.121
Spent years hunting the bad guys
and made them pay.


843
01:03:35.204 --> 01:03:37.456
An ideal life.

844
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.710
The hell it is! 
Stop living like this!

845
01:03:48.801 --> 01:03:51.637
Get out and live with me.

846
01:03:51.721 --> 01:03:54.765
I like the way it is now.

847
01:03:55.892 --> 01:03:58.019
A place in Sydney wants me.

848
01:04:00.062 --> 01:04:01.731
I'm flying out tomorrow.

849
01:04:10.865 --> 01:04:13.784
Piece-of-shit alarm!

850
01:04:18.915 --> 01:04:20.625
You could have woken me up.

851
01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:22.585
You're great sleeping.

852
01:04:22.668 --> 01:04:23.836
Great sleeping?

853
01:04:25.546 --> 01:04:29.216
What's that supposed to mean?
Cute? Pretty?


854
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.301
Sorry.

855
01:04:30.384 --> 01:04:32.261
I brought some intel.

856
01:04:34.096 --> 01:04:35.181
Gotta go.

857
01:04:36.474 --> 01:04:39.977
I found out what Yusuf got for George.

858
01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:43.481
A top mercenary. 
Oliver Hendrickson.

859
01:04:43.564 --> 01:04:46.317
He's in Japan, with the Hanaokas.

860
01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:49.445
-Nagoya or Kobe?
-Pops will call you first thing.


861
01:04:50.196 --> 01:04:52.156
Out of time. Bye.

862
01:04:54.241 --> 01:04:56.202
Tak Boy.

863
01:04:56.953 --> 01:04:59.413
-You're here.
-Debriefing.


864
01:05:01.123 --> 01:05:03.209
-The fuck?
-Sorry.


865
01:05:03.709 --> 01:05:06.545
Ears aren't for licking or chewing.

866
01:05:06.629 --> 01:05:08.839
You're right. So right.

867
01:05:08.923 --> 01:05:14.387
Hendrickson in Nagoya
means George is teamed up with them.


868
01:05:15.471 --> 01:05:17.223
-Do you follow?
-Yes, sir.


869
01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.978
The Hanaokas may be the largest family,
but they're a mess.


870
01:05:23.396 --> 01:05:27.149
The boss is in Nagoya,
but HQ is still in Kobe.


871
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:30.861
The boss tried to move HQ to Nagoya,

872
01:05:30.945 --> 01:05:34.073
but gave up after Kobe raised hell.

873
01:05:34.156 --> 01:05:38.953
Opposition was led by Tawaraya,
head of the Kobe family.


874
01:05:39.495 --> 01:05:44.834
So, the boss set up a system
to squeeze the Kobe faction.


875
01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:47.753
Forces them to buy
water, soap, TP and more


876
01:05:47.837 --> 01:05:50.464
sold by the Nagoya faction.

877
01:05:50.548 --> 01:05:53.009
Both are full of resentment.

878
01:05:54.093 --> 01:05:58.431
Our boss invited Tawaraya up
to deepen the wedge.


879
01:05:58.514 --> 01:06:02.059
Isn't Tawaraya
a prison buddy of Uncle Bear?


880
01:06:02.143 --> 01:06:05.938
Been tight for 20 years,
but I don't like him.


881
01:06:06.022 --> 01:06:08.482
He flip-flops, he's a chameleon.

882
01:06:09.233 --> 01:06:12.653
The boss and Bear
need to be more careful.

883
01:06:12.737 --> 01:06:14.447
What's my job?

884
01:06:15.698 --> 01:06:19.326
-If he acts oddly, kill him.
-We can't carry a gun.


885
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.412
-There's no pat down today.
-Still…


886
01:06:21.495 --> 01:06:22.580
WILD WEST FAMILY FEUD

887
01:06:22.663 --> 01:06:26.542
I said, "It doesn't feel right."
And they cut me out.


888
01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:31.255
Think of it as
standing in for me. Please.

889
01:06:32.965 --> 01:06:34.175
-Ready?
-Yes, sir.


890
01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:36.135
We're ready.

891
01:06:36.969 --> 01:06:39.096
<i>Ho capito, due minuti.</i>

892
01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.600
-What's that?
-Bear thinks he's Italian.


893
01:06:42.683 --> 01:06:45.227
You ran into Tak outside a club?

894
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:49.523
Yeah, Nas-teeth saw him.
He was like "Look, look!"


895
01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:28.187
Welcome.

896
01:07:31.357 --> 01:07:32.733
Sorry for the trouble.

897
01:07:32.817 --> 01:07:36.445
No trouble at all. 
Anything for you, sir.

898
01:07:36.529 --> 01:07:38.280
Kobe requested you.

899
01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:41.242
-They seemed pleased on the last visit.
-Welcome.


900
01:07:41.742 --> 01:07:42.743
They're waiting.

901
01:07:57.133 --> 01:07:58.467
It's been a while.

902
01:07:59.426 --> 01:08:01.804
-Him?
-My secretary, Buzz.


903
01:08:02.304 --> 01:08:04.181
A pleasure, sir.

904
01:08:05.474 --> 01:08:06.517
Brother!

905
01:08:11.063 --> 01:08:12.523
My security.

906
01:08:12.606 --> 01:08:16.569
Tak, a capo in
the Kozu family, and Muro.

907
01:08:16.652 --> 01:08:19.738
-So you're the guys… I see.
-I'm Muro.


908
01:08:19.822 --> 01:08:22.700
-I'm Tak.
-Heard a lot about you. Strong faces.


909
01:08:22.783 --> 01:08:23.909
Thank you.

910
01:08:29.456 --> 01:08:32.835
Is your family siding with George again?

911
01:08:32.918 --> 01:08:35.504
You mean Oliver in Nagoya?

912
01:08:35.588 --> 01:08:37.840
Sorry for the nuisance.

913
01:08:37.923 --> 01:08:40.426
It's just a family matter.

914
01:08:40.926 --> 01:08:42.553
Am I interfering?

915
01:08:42.636 --> 01:08:45.848
Oh, no. We just don't have time
to pick fights.


916
01:08:45.931 --> 01:08:48.100
That foreigner's a pain for us.

917
01:08:48.184 --> 01:08:49.810
There are rumors…

918
01:08:49.894 --> 01:08:51.770
Oliver's training Nagoya men…

919
01:08:51.854 --> 01:08:52.980
…to send us a message.

920
01:08:53.063 --> 01:08:54.315
"We'll destroy you"…

921
01:08:54.398 --> 01:08:56.108
Recruiting foreigners…

922
01:08:56.192 --> 01:08:58.652
…how to shoot, use knives.

923
01:08:58.736 --> 01:09:02.823
They're tryin' to intimidate us
any way they can.


924
01:09:11.874 --> 01:09:15.044
I didn't invite you here for rumors.

925
01:09:16.003 --> 01:09:19.298
Sorry. Nagoya's got their guard up.

926
01:09:19.381 --> 01:09:21.133
I'll pay for it all.

927
01:09:21.217 --> 01:09:25.387
Plant a bug, get transmitters--
I need reliable intel.


928
01:09:26.722 --> 01:09:29.892
I know Oliver is connected to George.

929
01:09:30.476 --> 01:09:32.811
Share our urgency, will you?

930
01:09:32.895 --> 01:09:37.733
Mr. Toake, you know it's impossible.
We'd be traitors.


931
01:09:38.317 --> 01:09:42.154
So be it. It's time you make up
your mind anyway.


932
01:09:43.781 --> 01:09:44.782
Make up our--

933
01:09:44.865 --> 01:09:47.534
What's Hanaoka without Kobe?

934
01:09:55.542 --> 01:10:00.256
Supposing the family breaks up,

935
01:10:00.881 --> 01:10:03.467
Nagoya will set its target on you,
no doubt.


936
01:10:04.969 --> 01:10:08.180
So I'll kill George, then take Nagoya.

937
01:10:09.014 --> 01:10:10.432
It's what I live for.

938
01:10:13.686 --> 01:10:18.232
The boss shared his honest thoughts.
Now it's your turn.


939
01:10:19.566 --> 01:10:23.946
Our guests are sweating. Crank the AC.

940
01:10:24.029 --> 01:10:25.030
Yes, sir.

941
01:10:28.033 --> 01:10:31.120
How did we become so slavish?

942
01:10:31.787 --> 01:10:35.082
Always reacting, never acting. Buzz?

943
01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:38.460
You said you'd pay for it all.

944
01:10:43.132 --> 01:10:46.093
Three hundred million yen,
already laundered.


945
01:10:49.555 --> 01:10:51.598
Use it for information.

946
01:10:52.224 --> 01:10:53.225
Please.

947
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:57.396
Don't bow to us, sir, please.

948
01:10:57.479 --> 01:10:58.522
Buzz!

949
01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:19.793
He's good.

950
01:11:20.294 --> 01:11:22.421
-He's very good.
-Amazing.


951
01:11:39.188 --> 01:11:42.441
-I love being tied up.
-Yeah?


952
01:11:46.653 --> 01:11:48.238
Like that?

953
01:11:52.493 --> 01:11:53.827
Try it.

954
01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:56.830
Ouch!

955
01:11:57.664 --> 01:11:59.625
What else do you like?

956
01:12:21.522 --> 01:12:23.357
Buzz, sit down.

957
01:12:24.358 --> 01:12:26.193
Stop singing.

958
01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:27.820
You new here?

959
01:12:27.903 --> 01:12:29.530
I can't take anymore.

960
01:12:31.198 --> 01:12:32.574
Make him stop.

961
01:12:32.658 --> 01:12:35.536
I only started a week ago.

962
01:12:35.619 --> 01:12:40.499
Luca's new to the business.
Scold her for me if she needs it.


963
01:12:40.582 --> 01:12:43.085
-Sorry.
-What did you do before?


964
01:12:43.168 --> 01:12:45.629
An office job at a parts supplier.

965
01:12:45.712 --> 01:12:46.797
Full-time?

966
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.467
Yes, but the car companies started--

967
01:12:50.551 --> 01:12:51.635
Got it.

968
01:12:58.183 --> 01:12:59.184
Back me up.

969
01:13:02.062 --> 01:13:05.858
"Ring the bell"? 
I oughta ring your bell!

970
01:13:05.941 --> 01:13:06.984
Outta my way.

971
01:13:07.776 --> 01:13:09.736
Changing singers.

972
01:13:13.991 --> 01:13:15.909
I'll take another. Thanks.

973
01:13:16.869 --> 01:13:19.288
-Luca, another one, please.
-Yes.


974
01:13:19.371 --> 01:13:21.457
You wanna sing again?

975
01:13:46.732 --> 01:13:48.400
-Sir?
-Take a sip.


976
01:13:49.526 --> 01:13:51.403
Was I inappropriate?

977
01:13:51.487 --> 01:13:55.282
Surprise test. Taste it.
See if you got it right.


978
01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:58.160
It's made for the boss. We can't--

979
01:13:58.243 --> 01:13:59.495
Drink it.

980
01:14:03.123 --> 01:14:04.500
Had too many, Tak?

981
01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:05.584
I'm sober.

982
01:14:08.337 --> 01:14:09.755
Sorry. I'll make--

983
01:14:09.838 --> 01:14:11.465
Take a fuckin' sip!

984
01:14:13.509 --> 01:14:15.385
Tak? What's going on?

985
01:14:15.469 --> 01:14:17.387
Leave the girls alone.

986
01:14:17.971 --> 01:14:19.181
Hey, Tak.

987
01:14:19.264 --> 01:14:20.974
Luca, go to the others.

988
01:14:21.058 --> 01:14:22.059
Don't.

989
01:14:23.352 --> 01:14:24.770
What's up, Tak?

990
01:14:25.354 --> 01:14:28.607
She has calluses on her right hand.

991
01:14:29.441 --> 01:14:31.527
Years of gripping a knife,

992
01:14:32.277 --> 01:14:34.696
but she's not a chef.

993
01:14:38.158 --> 01:14:41.662
New girl, you have permission. Take a sip.

994
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:46.333
Learn on the job.

995
01:14:59.388 --> 01:15:01.974
Careful! Cover your face!

996
01:15:05.978 --> 01:15:08.814
-Get back!
-Turn up the music. Keep her in.


997
01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:11.066
Louder, louder!

998
01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:42.389
Stop!

999
01:16:10.042 --> 01:16:13.629
A newcomer? Are you a part of this?

1000
01:16:13.712 --> 01:16:15.130
Absolutely not!

1001
01:16:17.841 --> 01:16:20.802
No one in Ginza can offend the boss!

1002
01:16:20.886 --> 01:16:24.473
-I'd lose my business!
-Slick, we need processing.


1003
01:16:24.556 --> 01:16:26.808
Ladies, please don't worry.

1004
01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:29.311
You're safe.

1005
01:16:30.395 --> 01:16:33.607
I've never seen a hit woman.

1006
01:16:34.191 --> 01:16:36.985
I'm so sorry. After all your trouble.

1007
01:16:37.069 --> 01:16:41.156
Sounds funny, but I learned a lot.

1008
01:16:41.239 --> 01:16:44.326
We need to rethink security. Totally.

1009
01:16:44.826 --> 01:16:45.827
Yes.

1010
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.539
You have some good men under you.

1011
01:16:50.082 --> 01:16:52.334
Please stand up, ma'am.

1012
01:16:52.417 --> 01:16:53.502
Forgive me!

1013
01:16:53.585 --> 01:16:57.381
It's our fault.
We were out despite being targeted.


1014
01:16:57.881 --> 01:16:59.216
You're a victim.

1015
01:17:00.133 --> 01:17:01.718
Mr. Toake.

1016
01:17:04.137 --> 01:17:06.682
We had fun, drinking and singing.

1017
01:17:06.765 --> 01:17:10.811
Yes, sir.
There was never a girl named Luca here.


1018
01:17:24.241 --> 01:17:26.118
Outside is clear.

1019
01:17:26.201 --> 01:17:27.953
Take our guests back.

1020
01:17:28.036 --> 01:17:29.955
Yes, sir. And you?

1021
01:17:31.248 --> 01:17:32.290
I'll stay out.

1022
01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:35.335
See them out, ladies.

1023
01:17:35.419 --> 01:17:39.548
-Don't look so serious, you hear?
-Yes, ma'am.


1024
01:17:39.631 --> 01:17:41.800
-Louder.
-Yes, ma'am.


1025
01:17:41.883 --> 01:17:44.136
-Can't hear you!
-Yes, ma'am!


1026
01:17:44.219 --> 01:17:46.555
Buck up, Chisa. Ready?

1027
01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:56.773
We'll do the processing.

1028
01:17:56.857 --> 01:17:59.651
Sure. But I'm going with you.

1029
01:17:59.735 --> 01:18:02.028
That won't do. 
The brothers would kill me.

1030
01:18:02.112 --> 01:18:04.197
I'm in great spirits.

1031
01:18:06.241 --> 01:18:07.409
Both at once.

1032
01:18:07.492 --> 01:18:09.202
-You got it?
-I can carry 'em.


1033
01:18:17.252 --> 01:18:18.712
This is fine. See ya.

1034
01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.046
-Good night.
-Thanks.


1035
01:18:27.053 --> 01:18:28.722
Why did you call Slick?

1036
01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:30.599
His entourage will come.

1037
01:18:30.682 --> 01:18:32.309
I said come alone.

1038
01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:41.318
Stop there.

1039
01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.740
How are ya?

1040
01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:47.824
Evening, sir.

1041
01:18:54.706 --> 01:18:57.083
Muro, Tak, be on the lookout.

1042
01:18:57.167 --> 01:18:58.251
Copy that.

1043
01:19:21.358 --> 01:19:22.609
Monitors this way.

1044
01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:40.210
You're here, too?

1045
01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:42.212
-I was--
-Here, Slick!


1046
01:19:44.089 --> 01:19:48.510
Pops, Sis, Uncle, what's going on?

1047
01:19:48.593 --> 01:19:49.761
Just get in.

1048
01:19:49.845 --> 01:19:51.805
I planted a bug with the cash.

1049
01:20:11.032 --> 01:20:13.535
-Boss's order?
-Our own decision.


1050
01:20:13.618 --> 01:20:15.745
Tawaraya's on our side.

1051
01:20:15.829 --> 01:20:18.331
The boss thinks so, but not us.

1052
01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:21.960
-Uncle Bear?
-Unsure. He agreed to the bug.


1053
01:20:22.043 --> 01:20:24.379
George sent Hendrickson.

1054
01:20:24.462 --> 01:20:28.508
They knew the boss
would call Tawaraya if he found out.


1055
01:20:29.134 --> 01:20:31.803
Tawaraya chose the meeting place.

1056
01:20:31.887 --> 01:20:33.221
As always.

1057
01:20:33.305 --> 01:20:36.141
Right. But, then, the hit woman…

1058
01:20:36.808 --> 01:20:39.895
-George scripted this?
-Naturally.


1059
01:20:39.978 --> 01:20:42.522
Could he? He's half insane.

1060
01:20:42.606 --> 01:20:44.274
He got a strategist.

1061
01:20:44.357 --> 01:20:48.528
Either way, Tawaraya was not expecting

1062
01:20:48.612 --> 01:20:50.363
He'll go to George.

1063
01:20:50.447 --> 01:20:54.701
Or else Nagoya would think he's a traitor.
It'd be war.


1064
01:20:54.784 --> 01:20:57.287
Sing.

1065
01:20:57.871 --> 01:20:59.706
Sing.

1066
01:21:00.498 --> 01:21:03.418
Watchdog? Some coffee.

1067
01:21:03.501 --> 01:21:04.961
-Yes, Boss.
-Sing.


1068
01:21:05.045 --> 01:21:07.964
Come on, sing, will ya?

1069
01:21:08.048 --> 01:21:11.259
-Let her down, Bear.
-You sure?


1070
01:21:11.343 --> 01:21:13.219
Yes, I'm bored.

1071
01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:19.643
The heart of Toshokai's darkness.

1072
01:21:19.726 --> 01:21:23.855
All contraband comes through here:
drugs, knockoffs,


1073
01:21:25.315 --> 01:21:28.360
black market animals-- everything.

1074
01:21:29.694 --> 01:21:34.282
We killed some of the Expelled here
during the feud five years ago.


1075
01:21:34.366 --> 01:21:35.909
I smell chemicals.

1076
01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:38.244
Gotta clean in the summer.

1077
01:21:38.328 --> 01:21:41.665
Blood seeps in the floor. 
Brings maggots.

1078
01:21:41.748 --> 01:21:43.041
Who cleans it?

1079
01:21:43.124 --> 01:21:45.085
Our cleanup contractors.

1080
01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:47.003
They're messy.

1081
01:21:47.087 --> 01:21:48.630
They're thorough.

1082
01:21:49.339 --> 01:21:52.634
They use chemicals that beat blue light.

1083
01:21:52.717 --> 01:21:55.553
They deodorize with ozone.

1084
01:21:56.221 --> 01:21:58.223
We'll call them tomorrow.

1085
01:21:59.724 --> 01:22:02.394
It's easy to break a girl's fingers.

1086
01:22:02.936 --> 01:22:06.564
Takes time and effort to break her spirit.

1087
01:22:06.648 --> 01:22:07.857
What about her uniform?

1088
01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:10.318
There's a beautiful girl.

1089
01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:14.614
I bought the uniform. 
It cost a fortune.

1090
01:22:14.698 --> 01:22:15.782
And then?

1091
01:22:17.659 --> 01:22:19.035
Then? Nothing.

1092
01:22:25.834 --> 01:22:28.420
-Why didn't you use it?
-What?


1093
01:22:29.963 --> 01:22:31.506
Your ankle gun.

1094
01:22:31.589 --> 01:22:34.175
It was for Tawaraya, just in case.

1095
01:22:34.676 --> 01:22:37.929
-Pop's order?
-Couldn't let Tawaraya see it.


1096
01:22:40.015 --> 01:22:41.474
Makes sense.

1097
01:22:43.768 --> 01:22:48.064
Okay, I'm going to break
that bitch's spirit now.


1098
01:22:51.651 --> 01:22:53.611
Suppose George was smart--

1099
01:22:53.695 --> 01:22:54.904
-Shut up.
-Huh?


1100
01:22:54.988 --> 01:22:57.323
Just let him speak.

1101
01:22:57.824 --> 01:23:00.035
Would it end after the first wave?

1102
01:23:02.787 --> 01:23:05.707
I'll tell you before you snap.

1103
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:08.710
Tell us everything and you live.

1104
01:23:08.793 --> 01:23:11.296
Say nothing? We hurt you more,

1105
01:23:11.379 --> 01:23:15.425
till this hot thug gouges your eye
with a screwdriver.


1106
01:23:16.009 --> 01:23:18.720
I'll strum your optic nerves, Luca.

1107
01:23:18.803 --> 01:23:23.099
It would be <i>la musica</i> of such sorrow.

1108
01:23:23.183 --> 01:23:24.851
So true!

1109
01:23:32.817 --> 01:23:34.486
-Hey, Muro?
-Yeah?


1110
01:23:34.569 --> 01:23:37.405
Sound of a four-ounce poop. Go!

1111
01:23:37.489 --> 01:23:38.490
Poop?

1112
01:23:40.909 --> 01:23:42.285
What did you think?

1113
01:23:42.786 --> 01:23:44.746
-Wasn't it good?
-Your grunt.


1114
01:23:44.829 --> 01:23:46.748
It's a big poop. You do it.

1115
01:23:46.831 --> 01:23:47.832
Here ya go.

1116
01:23:50.376 --> 01:23:53.463
-Huge, 5.5 ounces.
-Nine ounces.


1117
01:23:53.546 --> 01:23:55.381
Nine ounces!

1118
01:23:55.465 --> 01:23:56.800
Mine was bigger.

1119
01:23:57.467 --> 01:23:59.886
Mr. Bear has the biggest.

1120
01:23:59.969 --> 01:24:02.639
He's sick! Sick, huge turd!

1121
01:24:04.099 --> 01:24:05.433
The boss went home.

1122
01:24:05.517 --> 01:24:08.311
Did you check? 
What if he went with them?

1123
01:24:08.394 --> 01:24:10.563
What's your point?

1124
01:24:10.647 --> 01:24:12.482
Bear wouldn't be followed.

1125
01:24:12.565 --> 01:24:15.610
I'd have the bitch swallow a tracker.

1126
01:24:15.693 --> 01:24:18.446
-The boss isn't home. I can't reach Bear.
-Ready?


1127
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:19.531
Go, go.

1128
01:24:27.247 --> 01:24:28.289
Huh? Boss?

1129
01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:30.375
What's up?

1130
01:24:31.584 --> 01:24:32.710
Hold on.

1131
01:24:43.638 --> 01:24:45.098
A tracker?

1132
01:24:47.559 --> 01:24:49.227
They set us up.

1133
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:51.729
Watchdog, the electrical panel!

1134
01:24:51.813 --> 01:24:53.898
I don't know where--

1135
01:25:01.072 --> 01:25:04.200
-Are there guns there?
-Just bats and clubs.


1136
01:25:05.827 --> 01:25:08.371
-Pops?
-<i>You with the boss?</i>


1137
01:25:08.454 --> 01:25:09.455
Yes.

1138
01:25:10.999 --> 01:25:12.834
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

1139
01:25:12.917 --> 01:25:15.378
It's about to get busy. Gotta go.

1140
01:25:17.797 --> 01:25:19.007
Go to processing.

1141
01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:23.094
-I'll need guns, it'd take a few hours--
-No need. It'll be over by then.


1142
01:25:23.178 --> 01:25:25.430
Just a stack of bodies. 
Take the cleaners.

1143
01:25:25.513 --> 01:25:26.931
I have to clean up?

1144
01:25:29.267 --> 01:25:31.144
-Get in the car!
-All right.


1145
01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:32.687
I'll navigate.

1146
01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:42.071
A
-Team, get here. ASAP.

1147
01:25:42.155 --> 01:25:44.073
-Boss! To the office!
-Go!


1148
01:25:44.157 --> 01:25:46.743
-Guns!
-Ain't none here.


1149
01:25:46.826 --> 01:25:48.912
Wait, there may be one.

1150
01:25:48.995 --> 01:25:51.623
-Hurry, hurry!
-There might be something!


1151
01:25:51.706 --> 01:25:54.125
-Chauffeur!
-I'll look for it!


1152
01:25:54.834 --> 01:25:56.002
Uncle Bear!

1153
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.504
I'll hold them here.

1154
01:26:59.691 --> 01:27:01.317
Watchdog, Watchdog.

1155
01:27:01.901 --> 01:27:04.028
I found a gun.

1156
01:27:04.862 --> 01:27:05.863
The hell?

1157
01:27:05.947 --> 01:27:09.325
A Manville. Really loud. Ineffective.

1158
01:27:09.409 --> 01:27:13.663
Cops used it on a union strike in '35.
Old boss got it.


1159
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:16.958
-It's got cobwebs.
-It was oiled.


1160
01:27:17.041 --> 01:27:19.043
-Will it fire?
-If this turns…


1161
01:27:19.836 --> 01:27:20.837
Give it to me.

1162
01:27:25.049 --> 01:27:26.884
-I'll get rounds.
-Got it.


1163
01:27:27.385 --> 01:27:30.888
One pound… Two pounds…

1164
01:27:50.742 --> 01:27:52.702
Nine enemies. They've split.

1165
01:27:53.202 --> 01:27:55.997
They're going up. 
Tak, go take 'em out.

1166
01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.458
-But…
-We got it here.


1167
01:27:58.958 --> 01:28:00.710
Go help Bear. Go.

1168
01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:03.921
-Take it.
-Thanks.


1169
01:28:05.131 --> 01:28:06.257
Give it.

1170
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:09.344
-Put up a wall.
-Yes, sir.


1171
01:29:02.855 --> 01:29:03.856
Uncle Bear!

1172
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:08.903
Watch out!

1173
01:29:22.667 --> 01:29:25.128
-You're blocking my shot.
-Sorry.


1174
01:29:33.136 --> 01:29:34.220
They're moving.

1175
01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:37.890
-Follow us.
-Yes, sir!


1176
01:29:47.108 --> 01:29:48.276
Grunt.

1177
01:29:51.279 --> 01:29:54.282
Like you're pooping. Grunt for me.

1178
01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:57.493
Now?

1179
01:29:59.245 --> 01:30:01.414
Now's the moment. Now or never.

1180
01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:52.381
Luca…

1181
01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:52.608
One more.

1182
01:31:54.068 --> 01:31:55.569
Is the boss…

1183
01:31:58.781 --> 01:32:00.116
safe?

1184
01:32:04.287 --> 01:32:05.913
Hello?

1185
01:32:23.556 --> 01:32:24.598
The chauffeur?

1186
01:32:33.232 --> 01:32:34.233
Bear.

1187
01:32:35.693 --> 01:32:36.777
I'm sorry.

1188
01:32:37.987 --> 01:32:39.113
I'm sorry.

1189
01:32:43.534 --> 01:32:45.369
Should we hug, too?

1190
01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.246
No.

1191
01:32:48.664 --> 01:32:50.166
Okay, stop, stop.

1192
01:32:55.379 --> 01:32:58.007
Hurry! Start cleaning. Take pics.

1193
01:32:58.090 --> 01:33:00.468
We have another stop. Quickly.

1194
01:33:01.302 --> 01:33:03.054
A
-Team took the boss home.

1195
01:33:03.554 --> 01:33:05.639
I know. Pops wants you.

1196
01:33:05.723 --> 01:33:07.350
-Got a car?
-Follow me.


1197
01:33:10.269 --> 01:33:13.606
See how we look? 
Shouldn't speed too much.

1198
01:33:13.689 --> 01:33:15.691
Cops? Just shoot 'em.

1199
01:33:15.775 --> 01:33:18.152
You know, I've never shot a cop.

1200
01:33:18.235 --> 01:33:22.114
-Really?
-I don't want to, either. Respect.


1201
01:33:22.698 --> 01:33:25.493
A yakuza respecting cops?

1202
01:33:25.576 --> 01:33:28.120
I heard a heartwarming story.

1203
01:33:28.621 --> 01:33:29.622
What story?

1204
01:33:30.414 --> 01:33:33.918
A supermarket was robbed 11 years ago.

1205
01:33:34.502 --> 01:33:37.713
A staff lady
and three teenagers were killed.


1206
01:33:38.631 --> 01:33:42.093
I remember. It was awful.
Crazy Chinese mafia.


1207
01:33:42.176 --> 01:33:44.178
I met the lady's daughter.

1208
01:33:45.304 --> 01:33:49.725
For six months,
she's been getting an envelope of cash


1209
01:33:49.809 --> 01:33:54.688
with a note: "The killer has paid."
Signed only "G.I."


1210
01:33:54.772 --> 01:33:56.357
So, where's the cop?

1211
01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:59.985
There was a cop stationed nearby:
Goro Idezuki.


1212
01:34:00.069 --> 01:34:01.404
Initials are "G.I."

1213
01:34:01.487 --> 01:34:04.156
Right. Dope story if it's him.

1214
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.452
Hunts the killers for 11 years
and pays the victims.


1215
01:34:08.953 --> 01:34:10.329
So badass.

1216
01:34:21.507 --> 01:34:24.343
-Did the attacks work?
-They didn't.


1217
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:26.929
He has fierce security.

1218
01:34:27.012 --> 01:34:30.099
-We got your buddy.
-Bear's dead?


1219
01:34:30.182 --> 01:34:32.393
Is this the 300-million-yen gift?

1220
01:34:32.476 --> 01:34:34.645
I don't understand Toake.

1221
01:34:34.728 --> 01:34:37.189
Gotta figure out our next step.

1222
01:34:37.273 --> 01:34:38.941
-Right.
-Park the car.


1223
01:34:39.942 --> 01:34:43.320
You said hit man. 
I didn't expect a girl.

1224
01:34:43.404 --> 01:34:45.197
But I expected your song.

1225
01:34:45.281 --> 01:34:47.408
-Which one?
-Don't you know?


1226
01:35:11.223 --> 01:35:13.934
-Where's Pops?
-He left. Got impatient.


1227
01:35:14.018 --> 01:35:16.228
-When?
-Five minutes ago, Emiri?


1228
01:35:16.312 --> 01:35:17.855
Or so. You hurt?

1229
01:35:17.938 --> 01:35:19.607
-Not my blood.
-There'll be more.


1230
01:35:19.690 --> 01:35:21.442
-Wait for cleanup.
-Copy.


1231
01:35:21.525 --> 01:35:23.319
-Nas-teeth, lead.
-I'll lead.


1232
01:35:31.744 --> 01:35:33.120
-I'll lead--
-Nas-teeth?


1233
01:35:33.204 --> 01:35:34.205
Which way?

1234
01:35:34.955 --> 01:35:37.208
Yes, there.

1235
01:35:37.291 --> 01:35:38.709
-Where?
-Go straight.


1236
01:35:46.842 --> 01:35:47.843
Nas-teeth?

1237
01:35:47.927 --> 01:35:50.137
He's gone. He was right behind us.

1238
01:36:12.409 --> 01:36:13.452
Get him!

1239
01:36:13.536 --> 01:36:15.287
Who the fuck are you?

1240
01:36:15.371 --> 01:36:17.206
What the hell is this?

1241
01:36:18.332 --> 01:36:19.375
Big bro!

1242
01:36:25.798 --> 01:36:27.967
Fuckers! Ouch!

1243
01:36:33.556 --> 01:36:34.598
Found you!

1244
01:36:45.401 --> 01:36:47.486
Big bro! Move!

1245
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:49.280
Out of my way.

1246
01:36:59.456 --> 01:37:01.458
Just like you thought, Pops.

1247
01:37:01.542 --> 01:37:03.043
We'll bury Bear in secret.

1248
01:37:03.544 --> 01:37:06.380
-You get me?
-No, sir.


1249
01:37:06.463 --> 01:37:10.801
Bear will go AWOL
and Toshokai will disown him.


1250
01:37:11.552 --> 01:37:15.639
He sets off to
the next world in dishonor.

1251
01:37:16.265 --> 01:37:20.060
He has no savings.
Never paid attention to money.


1252
01:37:20.144 --> 01:37:24.148
Never had kids so he could
die without regrets.


1253
01:37:24.231 --> 01:37:25.691
What about his wife?

1254
01:37:25.774 --> 01:37:29.903
The 300 million we got back.
This goes to her.


1255
01:37:32.823 --> 01:37:36.827
-Just the tables for now. No chairs yet.
-Bring the chairs here.


1256
01:37:37.953 --> 01:37:39.830
Space the bowls equally.

1257
01:37:41.081 --> 01:37:42.082
-Mr. Slick?
-Yeah?


1258
01:37:42.166 --> 01:37:43.459
That story…

1259
01:37:45.961 --> 01:37:48.339
'bout Tak and the police box.

1260
01:37:49.548 --> 01:37:51.008
In Shinjuku?

1261
01:37:51.091 --> 01:37:53.927
-I thought Goro was the trans.
-What?


1262
01:37:54.011 --> 01:37:55.679
The cop was shouting--

1263
01:37:57.931 --> 01:38:01.226
-He was calling Mr. Tak, "Goro."
-Goro?


1264
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:04.897
"Hey! Goro Idezuki!" From Muro's story.

1265
01:38:05.439 --> 01:38:07.316
The "G.I." cop.

1266
01:38:10.486 --> 01:38:13.405
Did you know Mr. 
Tak was a cop?

1267
01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.827
-Did you tell others?
-No, sir.


1268
01:38:18.911 --> 01:38:20.371
-Don't tell anyone.
-I won't.


1269
01:38:20.454 --> 01:38:22.706
-Go back to work.
-Back to work.


1270
01:38:25.918 --> 01:38:28.003
-Goodbye.
-You have to wait.


1271
01:38:28.087 --> 01:38:31.799
Bear's capo, Monma,
will start a new family.


1272
01:38:31.882 --> 01:38:32.925
Koharu?

1273
01:38:33.926 --> 01:38:35.678
-Koharu?
-Yes?


1274
01:38:35.761 --> 01:38:38.597
-Go help with the arrivals.
-Yes, ma'am.


1275
01:38:38.681 --> 01:38:40.224
-Are you free?
-Yes.


1276
01:38:40.849 --> 01:38:43.227
-Move.
-Sorry, sir.


1277
01:38:45.646 --> 01:38:48.023
Hang in there. It's hard.

1278
01:38:48.107 --> 01:38:50.901
Koharu? Over there? Gotta change!

1279
01:38:50.984 --> 01:38:52.444
Over here, I brought it.

1280
01:39:04.707 --> 01:39:08.001
-Hurry.
-Yes, sir!


1281
01:39:11.755 --> 01:39:14.550
Thank you for accommodating us.

1282
01:39:15.175 --> 01:39:17.219
I used to be a yakuza too.

1283
01:40:02.514 --> 01:40:05.601
Lunch is from my husband's restaurant.

1284
01:40:05.684 --> 01:40:09.062
Prepared with care just as Bear liked.

1285
01:40:10.314 --> 01:40:11.899
I hope you enjoy it.

1286
01:40:18.447 --> 01:40:19.448
You okay?

1287
01:40:20.866 --> 01:40:23.494
It's totally gone-- my appetite.

1288
01:40:24.161 --> 01:40:25.245
Boss,

1289
01:40:26.455 --> 01:40:28.332
who'll be secretary?

1290
01:40:28.415 --> 01:40:30.918
I wanted Toki as an interim,

1291
01:40:31.752 --> 01:40:33.212
but he refused.

1292
01:40:34.755 --> 01:40:36.423
Then, Slick?

1293
01:40:36.924 --> 01:40:38.717
I still have a lot to learn--

1294
01:40:38.801 --> 01:40:41.845
-Tak will do it.
-Toki and I agreed.


1295
01:40:45.349 --> 01:40:47.184
From the boss.

1296
01:40:51.730 --> 01:40:52.731
Boss?

1297
01:40:53.565 --> 01:40:55.567
-Ready, sir?
-Anytime.


1298
01:40:58.278 --> 01:41:02.324
Tak, it's your first job
as secretary. Come.


1299
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:22.970
Are Tak and I…?

1300
01:41:23.053 --> 01:41:25.472
You're no longer a team.

1301
01:41:39.862 --> 01:41:41.405
Pops!

1302
01:41:44.157 --> 01:41:45.409
Shut up and watch.

1303
01:41:45.492 --> 01:41:49.246
Bear died because
you put yourself in danger.


1304
01:41:50.289 --> 01:41:52.416
Do you realize what you did?

1305
01:41:53.125 --> 01:41:54.209
I do.

1306
01:41:57.004 --> 01:42:00.382
The boss never goes to a torture site.

1307
01:42:01.133 --> 01:42:02.134
I'll go check.

1308
01:42:13.770 --> 01:42:17.566
I deserve it.
I need to make it right with Bear.


1309
01:42:19.026 --> 01:42:20.527
Give me another.

1310
01:42:29.328 --> 01:42:30.495
Pops!

1311
01:42:32.247 --> 01:42:33.999
Shut up. Stay back!

1312
01:42:34.082 --> 01:42:35.667
Don't interfere.

1313
01:42:39.546 --> 01:42:42.633
Don't. Cutting off a finger's so passé.

1314
01:42:42.716 --> 01:42:46.887
It's the price I pay for hitting you.

1315
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:48.055
Don't.

1316
01:42:50.891 --> 01:42:54.478
Tak, step on it for me. 
I got hard bones.

1317
01:42:54.561 --> 01:42:56.980
I'm your boss. Stop!

1318
01:42:58.982 --> 01:43:01.109
-Step on it, now.
-Stop it!


1319
01:43:02.861 --> 01:43:04.863
-How dare--
-Quiet, Slick!


1320
01:43:05.822 --> 01:43:08.241
Toki hit the boss. 
He deserves it.

1321
01:43:08.325 --> 01:43:10.285
Now it's over. Got it?

1322
01:43:10.369 --> 01:43:11.995
Listen to me.

1323
01:43:13.246 --> 01:43:16.291
Toki gave me a
chance to make it right.

1324
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.419
He took the risk. I'm grateful.

1325
01:43:22.965 --> 01:43:24.841
Carry him out.

1326
01:43:25.342 --> 01:43:28.261
Toki's stubborn. 
He'll try again.

1327
01:43:28.345 --> 01:43:32.015
I know.
I'll hide anything he'd try to use.


1328
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:35.185
The funeral's not over.

1329
01:43:36.353 --> 01:43:39.564
Let's sing Bear's favorite song together.

1330
01:43:45.278 --> 01:43:48.657
You should be cuttin' off your finger.

1331
01:43:49.157 --> 01:43:52.744
You took the boss to fuckin' processing.

1332
01:43:52.828 --> 01:43:54.037
I'm sorry.

1333
01:43:54.121 --> 01:43:58.000
They may forgive you,
but I won't, you fuck.


1334
01:43:58.083 --> 01:44:01.962
I'll rip you a new one,
stuff it with leftovers.


1335
01:44:02.045 --> 01:44:05.674
A finger like this?
You can have it anytime.


1336
01:44:07.175 --> 01:44:08.719
But how is it that

1337
01:44:08.802 --> 01:44:12.431
a Kozu capo lets a guy
get behind him so easily?


1338
01:44:14.057 --> 01:44:15.934
Kinda embarrassing.

1339
01:44:16.018 --> 01:44:18.812
Fuck you, you low-life psychopath.

1340
01:44:19.312 --> 01:44:21.398
Stop, Muro.

1341
01:44:21.982 --> 01:44:22.983
Let's go.

1342
01:44:24.818 --> 01:44:27.362
I'm going to take a piss first.

1343
01:44:46.548 --> 01:44:47.799
What the…?

1344
01:44:48.383 --> 01:44:49.634
You fuck!

1345
01:44:49.718 --> 01:44:52.554
I'm risking everything to advise you.

1346
01:44:52.637 --> 01:44:54.765
Just like Pops showed us.

1347
01:44:55.891 --> 01:44:57.225
Calm down.

1348
01:44:57.309 --> 01:44:59.936
"Son of death row inmates"?

1349
01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.188
I never said that.

1350
01:45:01.271 --> 01:45:06.068
It's our work that lets you make money
without fear.


1351
01:45:10.947 --> 01:45:12.616
Goin' too far?

1352
01:45:15.952 --> 01:45:18.121
Nope, not at all.

1353
01:45:19.623 --> 01:45:20.707
Who cares?

1354
01:45:30.425 --> 01:45:33.845
Wait, Muro, wait! 
I need your help.

1355
01:45:33.929 --> 01:45:35.722
It's no time for us to fight.

1356
01:45:37.307 --> 01:45:41.144
This must be what it's like
when a killer snaps.


1357
01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:45.690
Your hero, Goro, the cop.

1358
01:45:45.774 --> 01:45:47.067
What about it?

1359
01:45:47.150 --> 01:45:49.361
It might be Tak!

1360
01:45:49.903 --> 01:45:51.154
Impossible.

1361
01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:55.367
It's true, ask Nas-teeth.
We just need proof.


1362
01:45:55.450 --> 01:45:58.703
Get a better excuse to save your life.

1363
01:45:58.787 --> 01:46:00.580
He may be an undercover.

1364
01:46:01.289 --> 01:46:03.416
We need to protect Toshokai.

1365
01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.461
We got along before Tak. Remember?

1366
01:48:53.336 --> 01:48:54.754
Sad.

1367
01:48:57.340 --> 01:48:59.676
I low-key snapped.

1368
01:49:01.261 --> 01:49:04.139
I wish I could blame it on drugs.

1369
01:49:05.932 --> 01:49:07.642
I saw my parents.

1370
01:49:08.226 --> 01:49:11.438
Slick looks just like my dad.

1371
01:49:11.521 --> 01:49:12.522
Run.

1372
01:49:14.649 --> 01:49:15.650
Run.

1373
01:49:17.068 --> 01:49:20.322
Are you undercover? No, right?

1374
01:49:20.405 --> 01:49:22.157
No, I'm not.

1375
01:49:22.741 --> 01:49:24.951
I don't like that "no."

1376
01:49:25.035 --> 01:49:26.244
I'm…

1377
01:49:28.371 --> 01:49:31.207
a Hell Dog. The same as you.

1378
01:49:31.291 --> 01:49:34.461
I've had nightmares all my life.

1379
01:49:34.544 --> 01:49:37.839
But you and I…
It could have been good.

1380
01:49:49.017 --> 01:49:52.228
I'll send you to hell with Slick!

1381
01:50:44.614 --> 01:50:46.866
-Where is Muro?
-No idea.


1382
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:50.036
There's no way he hasn't called you.

1383
01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:52.372
-Your phone?
-Hold on.


1384
01:50:52.455 --> 01:50:53.456
What?

1385
01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:56.584
Think you'll get away with this?

1386
01:50:57.502 --> 01:50:58.545
Of course.

1387
01:51:01.673 --> 01:51:02.674
Tak!

1388
01:51:07.429 --> 01:51:10.932
Hunt for Muro as you like,
but leave me alone.


1389
01:51:11.808 --> 01:51:13.476
Gotcha.

1390
01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:14.978
-Language.
-Yes, sir.


1391
01:51:15.061 --> 01:51:16.771
-Can't hear.
-Yes, sir!


1392
01:51:18.273 --> 01:51:20.108
-Let me out.
-Yes, sir.


1393
01:51:25.238 --> 01:51:26.614
My head!

1394
01:51:35.498 --> 01:51:37.625
You're very bold.

1395
01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:39.294
Change of plans.

1396
01:51:40.670 --> 01:51:42.797
What was with Hendrickson?

1397
01:51:42.881 --> 01:51:45.300
An FBI decoy.

1398
01:51:45.383 --> 01:51:49.179
Went home. The real Hendrickson
died two years ago in Syria--


1399
01:51:49.262 --> 01:51:52.682
You can't just stroll
into my place like this.


1400
01:51:53.183 --> 01:51:54.434
One more hit.

1401
01:51:54.517 --> 01:51:57.437
After that, you're free.
Go on vacation, retire.


1402
01:51:57.937 --> 01:51:59.522
We'll pay for it all.

1403
01:52:05.445 --> 01:52:06.613
I won't retire.

1404
01:52:07.906 --> 01:52:10.867
I swore to protect
my families till I die.

1405
01:52:11.493 --> 01:52:13.411
-Families?
-Four families.


1406
01:52:16.164 --> 01:52:18.166
Atoning for Goro Idezuki.

1407
01:52:18.249 --> 01:52:22.837
Kill the boss and steal the secret file?

1408
01:52:26.883 --> 01:52:28.635
Toake's real name is So Koreyasu.

1409
01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:34.599
We trained him with the FBI.
He was undercover in Toshokai.


1410
01:52:36.184 --> 01:52:40.396
The files are his email
and call records with us.


1411
01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.648
Dumbasses.

1412
01:52:42.857 --> 01:52:47.195
He was to split up Toshokai
and cut off cash flow


1413
01:52:47.278 --> 01:52:49.864
to far-right pols in the US.

1414
01:52:49.948 --> 01:52:50.990
Illegal casinos?

1415
01:52:51.074 --> 01:52:55.370
International Evangelical Alliance.
"Neo-Episteme." Heard of them?


1416
01:52:55.453 --> 01:52:57.622
He sees them a lot.

1417
01:52:58.748 --> 01:53:04.128
The Tokyo branch has diplomatic immunity.
They built a casino.


1418
01:53:04.212 --> 01:53:09.008
Toake used his ins to raise
his business reputation abroad.


1419
01:53:14.264 --> 01:53:16.349
It's your mistake.

1420
01:53:17.767 --> 01:53:19.602
You handle it.

1421
01:53:20.103 --> 01:53:21.771
Then, I'll kill you.

1422
01:53:23.523 --> 01:53:26.192
Tak Boy's undercover, too?

1423
01:53:33.741 --> 01:53:35.535
You're lovers?

1424
01:53:35.618 --> 01:53:37.537
You scared me!

1425
01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.830
You scared me.

1426
01:53:38.913 --> 01:53:40.707
You could have told me.

1427
01:53:43.418 --> 01:53:44.752
Would you like milk in it?

1428
01:53:44.836 --> 01:53:46.879
Hey, remember me?

1429
01:53:47.463 --> 01:53:50.341
Of course. What happened?

1430
01:53:50.967 --> 01:53:52.010
Nothing.

1431
01:53:52.885 --> 01:53:55.096
Is Anna back from Sydney?

1432
01:53:55.638 --> 01:53:57.432
She'll be back soon.

1433
01:53:57.515 --> 01:54:00.268
I think this is Goro, "G.I."

1434
01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:02.937
Can you ask Mr. Mamiya? I'll wait.

1435
01:54:03.021 --> 01:54:04.814
Can you? Ain't got time.

1436
01:54:08.401 --> 01:54:09.402
Here.

1437
01:54:12.655 --> 01:54:15.908
Poachers like elephants with big tusks.

1438
01:54:17.327 --> 01:54:22.957
Large adult males are killed first--
the ones that can mate.


1439
01:54:24.584 --> 01:54:29.631
Then they kill the matriarch,
the leader of the herd.


1440
01:54:31.132 --> 01:54:34.093
They can't survive without her.

1441
01:54:34.177 --> 01:54:38.139
Elephants will go extinct
unless poaching ends.


1442
01:54:38.222 --> 01:54:39.766
You've been there.

1443
01:54:39.849 --> 01:54:42.894
I was on an anti-poaching task force
in Tanzania.


1444
01:54:44.395 --> 01:54:46.940
Fresh out of vet school.

1445
01:54:47.023 --> 01:54:49.651
Japanese vet. Kid of a yakuza.

1446
01:54:49.734 --> 01:54:53.905
Japan says it's not involved
in ivory trafficking.


1447
01:54:53.988 --> 01:54:55.573
Fucking liars.

1448
01:54:55.657 --> 01:54:58.993
You know I work for the government.

1449
01:54:59.077 --> 01:55:01.955
I'm going to end
the yakuza's ivory business.


1450
01:55:23.434 --> 01:55:25.520
Kill all three at once.

1451
01:55:26.479 --> 01:55:28.147
I'll kill Toki.

1452
01:55:28.982 --> 01:55:30.525
-Alone?
-Of course.


1453
01:55:30.608 --> 01:55:31.901
And Chuji?

1454
01:55:33.152 --> 01:55:35.196
Someone who's waited eight years.

1455
01:55:47.291 --> 01:55:49.210
The wait is over.

1456
01:56:25.371 --> 01:56:27.665
-Morning.
-Good morning.


1457
01:56:32.545 --> 01:56:33.796
-Mornin', ma'am.
-Mornin'.


1458
01:56:35.423 --> 01:56:36.799
Babe?

1459
01:56:38.801 --> 01:56:40.219
You should be in bed.

1460
01:56:40.845 --> 01:56:42.638
Your fever will go up.

1461
01:56:44.766 --> 01:56:47.060
A bit early, but wanna do up?

1462
01:56:48.269 --> 01:56:50.480
Muro killed Slick.

1463
01:56:51.898 --> 01:56:52.899
Yes.

1464
01:56:53.649 --> 01:56:54.901
Who's on it?

1465
01:56:56.736 --> 01:57:00.198
The boss said to wait and see.

1466
01:57:05.912 --> 01:57:08.706
Why don't you make Tak do it?

1467
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:10.374
He's secretary to the boss.

1468
01:57:10.458 --> 01:57:11.793
I can't make him!

1469
01:57:11.876 --> 01:57:14.962
You're lovers. 
I've known it a while.

1470
01:57:17.673 --> 01:57:21.385
Tak's important. 
That's why you're alive.

1471
01:57:31.312 --> 01:57:32.855
Fuckin' bitch!

1472
01:57:39.529 --> 01:57:41.155
You gotta be kiddin'.

1473
01:57:52.208 --> 01:57:53.960
Neo
-Episteme today?

1474
01:57:54.043 --> 01:57:58.464
Yes, at 7 p.m. Mr. Dawson
of International Evangelical Alliance.


1475
01:57:58.548 --> 01:58:00.883
Perfect. I'll introduce you.

1476
01:58:04.554 --> 01:58:07.598
-Have you found Muro?
-Not yet.


1477
01:58:07.682 --> 01:58:10.184
-He'll contact you.
-If he does, I'll--


1478
01:58:10.268 --> 01:58:11.561
Don't.

1479
01:58:11.644 --> 01:58:13.688
I want him to escape overseas.

1480
01:58:14.897 --> 01:58:17.024
Slick was a problem anyway.

1481
01:58:18.025 --> 01:58:19.026
Thank you.

1482
01:58:23.531 --> 01:58:25.491
You and I… together to the grave.

1483
01:58:54.979 --> 01:58:58.024
Why was my son killed?

1484
01:58:58.608 --> 01:59:01.319
He touched my granddaughter.

1485
01:59:01.402 --> 01:59:04.071
I thought she came on to him.

1486
01:59:04.155 --> 01:59:06.407
Maybe. Same, either way.

1487
01:59:06.490 --> 01:59:08.951
Little thug didn't know his place.

1488
01:59:10.494 --> 01:59:15.249
I never said kill him. My men inferred it.
An accident.


1489
01:59:15.333 --> 01:59:19.045
Inferred to stab him over and over again?

1490
01:59:19.128 --> 01:59:20.838
What's your point?

1491
01:59:22.590 --> 01:59:27.887
The thing is, I can hear
my son's screams even now.


1492
01:59:28.638 --> 01:59:30.556
Crawling up these arms.

1493
01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:33.434
I paid you for your loss.

1494
01:59:33.935 --> 01:59:36.145
Yes, you did.

1495
02:00:14.517 --> 02:00:16.602
Ms. N, you done already?

1496
02:00:16.686 --> 02:00:19.939
He's tired today. 
Let him sleep an hour.

1497
02:00:20.022 --> 02:00:21.232
Yes, ma'am.

1498
02:00:22.191 --> 02:00:23.234
Don't got it.

1499
02:00:25.069 --> 02:00:28.572
But he's got one already.

1500
02:00:28.656 --> 02:00:30.449
Is it worth the 30,000 yen?

1501
02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:35.830
Good point.

1502
02:00:38.624 --> 02:00:39.750
Ms. N!

1503
02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.965
My shoulders are sore.

1504
02:00:46.048 --> 02:00:50.469
Your boss's warmth is still in my hands.
Do you dare?


1505
02:00:50.553 --> 02:00:53.180
Fine. Wait, where's your bag?

1506
02:00:53.764 --> 02:00:57.059
Didn't want to wake him.
I'll get it later.


1507
02:00:57.143 --> 02:00:58.144
Okay.

1508
02:00:59.145 --> 02:01:01.605
Okay. Five minutes, that's it.

1509
02:01:01.689 --> 02:01:03.107
Yes!

1510
02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:20.708
Just be back by evening.
Enjoy a fancy lunch.


1511
02:01:23.044 --> 02:01:24.253
Thank you, sir.

1512
02:01:34.055 --> 02:01:35.431
You're respectful.

1513
02:01:35.514 --> 02:01:37.641
You're secretary to the boss.

1514
02:01:37.725 --> 02:01:40.561
-Pat down by sight?
-No problem.


1515
02:01:40.644 --> 02:01:42.813
He was an LAPD spotter.

1516
02:01:42.897 --> 02:01:45.608
You see where a gun is carried?

1517
02:01:45.691 --> 02:01:47.401
More by the gait.

1518
02:01:47.485 --> 02:01:50.112
-How about the type?
-80% of the time.


1519
02:01:51.447 --> 02:01:53.366
-What's mine?
-Not on you.


1520
02:01:54.617 --> 02:01:56.118
I'm disappointed.

1521
02:01:56.619 --> 02:01:57.620
Why?

1522
02:01:58.162 --> 02:01:59.538
You and I…

1523
02:02:01.332 --> 02:02:03.000
could have been friends.

1524
02:02:04.543 --> 02:02:05.544
I have a gun…

1525
02:02:06.670 --> 02:02:08.464
hidden, you see?

1526
02:02:56.679 --> 02:02:58.639
This is a surprise.

1527
02:03:03.769 --> 02:03:07.356
I came to apologize to Pops, and this?

1528
02:03:11.694 --> 02:03:13.154
Vengeance is mine.

1529
02:03:14.405 --> 02:03:16.073
Don't take it wrong.

1530
02:03:16.699 --> 02:03:19.785
This is just a kiss. 
The kiss of death.

1531
02:03:22.121 --> 02:03:24.790
Tak will never forgive you.

1532
02:03:26.917 --> 02:03:29.295
He was a cop-- tactical unit.

1533
02:03:34.967 --> 02:03:37.219
He's my man.

1534
02:03:57.156 --> 02:03:58.282
Why?

1535
02:03:59.158 --> 02:04:01.619
You want to know why?

1536
02:04:02.536 --> 02:04:03.704
Yes.

1537
02:04:03.787 --> 02:04:06.207
The long or short version?

1538
02:04:07.541 --> 02:04:08.542
Long one.

1539
02:04:10.294 --> 02:04:11.754
Eleven years ago,

1540
02:04:13.255 --> 02:04:16.675
<i>I was a rookie cop in Shinjuku--</i>
<i>on 2nd Street.</i>


1541
02:04:16.759 --> 02:04:22.014
Please run a check on
registration number…


1542
02:04:22.097 --> 02:04:23.807
Sarge?

1543
02:04:25.142 --> 02:04:26.477
That guy has a gun.

1544
02:04:27.186 --> 02:04:29.230
How the hell do you know?

1545
02:04:29.313 --> 02:04:30.439
A Tokarev.

1546
02:04:31.273 --> 02:04:33.150
No conjectures, rookie.

1547
02:04:33.692 --> 02:04:35.236
I'm gun-spotting.

1548
02:04:35.319 --> 02:04:38.531
Can you say he's 100% carrying a Tokarev--

1549
02:04:39.114 --> 02:04:41.242
Hey, it's all you can drink!

1550
02:04:41.325 --> 02:04:42.368
You can't.

1551
02:04:42.952 --> 02:04:46.956
Gotta use all your senses,
not just your eyes.


1552
02:04:47.623 --> 02:04:48.666
Yes, sir.

1553
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:54.004
<i>Two hours later,</i>
<i>they robbed the supermarket.</i>


1554
02:04:58.050 --> 02:05:00.761
<i>Four killed by a Tokarev.</i>

1555
02:05:35.045 --> 02:05:36.297
You called?

1556
02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:39.049
I want to share my secret.

1557
02:05:45.764 --> 02:05:47.433
I was an undercover.

1558
02:05:48.726 --> 02:05:54.231
When the cops came down on Toshokai,
I came out to the Kozu Trio.


1559
02:05:54.315 --> 02:05:57.610
Told them we can outsmart
the cops and the FBI.


1560
02:05:58.569 --> 02:05:59.987
Heart is won by heart.

1561
02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:04.617
They instantly decided
to anoint me leader.


1562
02:06:06.035 --> 02:06:11.123
It's a kind of bond
lacking in the deceitful authorities.


1563
02:06:12.207 --> 02:06:16.086
Warm-blooded brothers
over an icy government.


1564
02:06:16.170 --> 02:06:17.463
Exactly.

1565
02:06:17.546 --> 02:06:19.548
Now, you've chosen me.

1566
02:06:21.967 --> 02:06:24.803
-Why?
-To see who you really are.


1567
02:06:26.347 --> 02:06:30.517
Anai would surely send in
a man worse than me.


1568
02:06:30.601 --> 02:06:32.061
You knew. When?

1569
02:06:35.814 --> 02:06:37.983
Just now. As we were talking.

1570
02:06:40.736 --> 02:06:42.946
But I've always wondered.

1571
02:06:44.281 --> 02:06:47.117
Just like a young girl with a flower.

1572
02:06:48.744 --> 02:06:51.288
He loves me… he loves me not.

1573
02:06:52.873 --> 02:06:56.210
Loves me… loves me not.

1574
02:06:57.961 --> 02:06:59.421
The A
-Team's gone?

1575
02:07:00.881 --> 02:07:02.132
Don't be a dog.

1576
02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:04.385
Free yourself.

1577
02:07:05.594 --> 02:07:09.056
We could take over the world together.

1578
02:07:10.724 --> 02:07:12.518
Deep is the darkness.

1579
02:07:13.102 --> 02:07:17.981
I think I'm a mad dog.
I only know how to bite.


1580
02:07:19.316 --> 02:07:21.735
It seems I was born that way.

1581
02:07:22.361 --> 02:07:24.571
-Besides…
-Besides?


1582
02:07:27.574 --> 02:07:29.451
I like elephants.

1583
02:07:52.474 --> 02:07:55.728
-Why not my head?
-Why not mine?


1584
02:08:37.519 --> 02:08:38.729
Where's Ms. N?

1585
02:08:43.066 --> 02:08:44.693
FINISHED. I'M OUT. 
-N.

1586
02:08:44.777 --> 02:08:46.403
Nothing from Emiri.

1587
02:08:46.487 --> 02:08:50.073
Sent a man and found Toki dead.
I'll go there now.


1588
02:08:50.574 --> 02:08:51.617
You?

1589
02:08:52.242 --> 02:08:53.452
I'll pray.

1590
02:09:08.717 --> 02:09:12.095
<i>Stuffin' myself to death! 
See ya soon.</i>

1591
02:09:12.679 --> 02:09:14.181
<i>I'm at the House of Bamboo.</i>

1592
02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:17.976
Got a special guest here.

1593
02:09:24.983 --> 02:09:26.652
<i>Hurry up, okay?</i>

1594
02:09:28.570 --> 02:09:33.200
<i>Video for Tak.</i>
<i>Say something, leave a message.</i>


1595
02:09:34.618 --> 02:09:38.622
<i>Come soon, or you might regret it.</i>

1596
02:09:42.209 --> 02:09:43.919
A murdered God.

1597
02:10:26.503 --> 02:10:29.047
What do you want, brother?

1598
02:10:29.631 --> 02:10:31.383
That word means a lot.

1599
02:10:31.967 --> 02:10:34.636
What do you want, Muro?

1600
02:10:36.305 --> 02:10:38.140
Three questions.

1601
02:10:38.932 --> 02:10:41.476
Please answer honestly.

1602
02:10:42.227 --> 02:10:43.228
Sure.

1603
02:10:46.648 --> 02:10:50.068
Are you an undercover agent, Goro?

1604
02:10:50.944 --> 02:10:51.945
Yes.

1605
02:10:53.447 --> 02:10:55.449
Who cares?

1606
02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:59.036
-Let's go back to the family.
-It's gone.


1607
02:10:59.119 --> 02:11:00.913
Leaders are dead.

1608
02:11:00.996 --> 02:11:03.749
So, what was I to Goro?

1609
02:11:03.832 --> 02:11:06.043
-You asking?
-Not really.


1610
02:11:06.627 --> 02:11:09.087
You were the King of the Wood.

1611
02:11:10.797 --> 02:11:15.052
"A priest seeks to kill a man.
Having killed him,


1612
02:11:16.386 --> 02:11:18.847
he is soon killed himself."

1613
02:11:18.931 --> 02:11:21.516
I don't get it, but it sounds dope.

1614
02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:24.770
I got this far because…

1615
02:11:28.523 --> 02:11:30.025
you were with me.

1616
02:11:34.863 --> 02:11:36.198
Last question.

1617
02:11:36.782 --> 02:11:39.952
-Can I avenge Pops?
-It's over, Muro.


1618
02:11:48.210 --> 02:11:49.795
Last question.

1619
02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:53.465
That was your last.

1620
02:11:55.717 --> 02:11:58.011
Which will it be? 
Me or this bitch?

1621
02:12:09.106 --> 02:12:11.191
Started with Mad Dog,

1622
02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:13.318
ends with Hell Dog.

1623
02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:28.917
-We do the kiss of death.
-Right?


1624
02:12:29.001 --> 02:12:30.293
Am I right?

1625
02:12:30.377 --> 02:12:34.214
-Should we?
-Right? Do the kiss of death.


1626
02:12:36.133 --> 02:12:38.552
-Right on the mouth.
-He won't give up.


1627
02:12:44.516 --> 02:12:45.642
Hey, you.

1628
02:12:46.268 --> 02:12:48.812
What the hell ya doin'?

1629
02:12:48.895 --> 02:12:51.231
We closed an hour ago.

1630
02:12:51.314 --> 02:12:52.524
You Japanese?

1631
02:12:53.775 --> 02:12:56.194
You're making us look bad.

1632
02:12:59.823 --> 02:13:01.199
Look at this guy.

1633
02:13:03.994 --> 02:13:08.123
Hold on! Let's calm down
and eat our yummy dinner.


1634
02:13:10.751 --> 02:13:11.918
Hey, stop.

1635
02:13:12.502 --> 02:13:14.671
This guy's legit.

1636
02:13:16.423 --> 02:13:18.508
This is wicked fun!

1637
02:13:18.592 --> 02:13:20.761
-Havin' fun?
-Lotta fun.


1638
02:13:20.844 --> 02:13:21.845
Lotta fun.
