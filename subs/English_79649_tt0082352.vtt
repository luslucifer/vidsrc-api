A lot of guys playing jokes

About?
- That is correct.


50
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.811
These people in the television does not
account for any service.


51
00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:49.321
But this seemed real.
I recognized his voice ...

What are you doing you, the hell?

69
00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:51.130
You're completely crazy?

70
00:11:51.306 --> 00:11:53.774
Hey, this is just a joke.
Someone had left in my cab.


71
00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:55.671
What is happening here?

72
00:11:55.844 --> 00:11:58.438
Some lunatic called me the whole night.

Just a minute, okay?
- Yes. Yes.


76
00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:20.858
I can not leave even a minute.

77
00:13:22.731 --> 00:13:24.358
Jeff?

78
00:13:27.469 --> 00:13:29.835
Enough is enough.
Joke is over.


79
00:13:31.774 --> 00:13:33.901
Now listen to me.

80
00:13:34.076 --> 00:13:35.703

81
00:15:36.598 --> 00:15:37.997
Oh, God.

82
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.260
What is it now?
- Time.


83
00:15:43.438 --> 00:15:45.804
I noted that the

84
00:15:46.008 --> 00:15:48.841
You know, we could help to
regime is one big problem.


85
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:50.569
What is it?

86
00:15:50.913 --> 00:15:54.474
I do not know what to put with
left side of my closet.


87
00:15:55.117 --> 00:15:56.550
There are lots of places.

88
00:15:56.718 --> 00:15:58.879
You have several types of options ...

89
00:15:59.054 --> 00:16:00.817
And ... you do not have rules that
must abide by.


90
00:16:00.989 --> 00:16:04.652
I fear that I will now have to
put away my advice.


91
00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:12.558
I think that trying to
utièeš the court's decision.


92
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.131
I always keep your
the limited provision.


93
00:16:19.608 --> 00:16:22.008
Hey, I just wanted to expose
its final decision.


94
00:16:22.177 --> 00:16:24.475
Well, we'll discuss about it later ...

95
00:16:24.646 --> 00:16:26.876
Noæni ... because the court is adjourned.

96
00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:29.483
You know, and my patience has an end.

97
00:16:29.851 --> 00:16:32.513
I think we've already discussed this.

98
00:16:32.688 --> 00:16:35.521
And we did. But I think we
also badly and agreed to doing something ...


99
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:37.556
That ... we'll talk with your sister.

100
00:16:38.193 --> 00:16:39.854
Not now.

101
00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:42.957
All right.

102
00:16:43.665 --> 00:16:45.530
But we can not always just procrastinate.

103
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:50.804
Do you have no idea ...

104
00:16:50.973 --> 00:16:54.272
Is ... how long should
create a peaceful home to Tracy?


105
00:16:55.477 --> 00:16:57.968
Not only can you change just like that.

106
00:16:58.146 --> 00:17:00.614
It would not be fair to her.

107
00:17:00.782 --> 00:17:02.841
See, I do not ask the
you to somebody.

You know what oseæam to you.

109
00:17:08.857 --> 00:17:12.088
But that's not the purpose.
It would be a burden for you.


110
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.057
Poèeæeš to be angry at her ...

111
00:17:14.229 --> 00:17:16.493
And ... after a time on me.

112
00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:19.600
And it would all end.

113
00:17:22.437 --> 00:17:25.372
How do you know?
- I know.


114
00:17:25.907 --> 00:17:27.238

00:24:31.099 --> 00:24:34.796
Ironical that the body found
detektivii who had received complaints ...


158
00:24:34.969 --> 00:24:37.301
Because of the obscene phone ...
call the previous night.


159
00:24:37.472 --> 00:24:39.940
Although the autopsy
still in progress ...


160
00:24:40.108 --> 00:24:42.008
Dejd district investigator ... ...

161
00:24:42.177 --> 00:24:45.544
According to preliminary reports ...
the woman was sexually abused ...


162
00:24:45.713 --> 00:24:48.477
Then strangled to death ...
opasaèem were found at the scene.


163
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.314
Police are currently working with a minimum

164
00:24:53.488 --> 00:24:56.048
Results are expected soon.
We'll be back soon ...


165
00:24:56.224 --> 00:24:58.658
Unfortunately, Roger, just not to be
too late and even more victims.


166
00:24:58.827 --> 00:25:00.761
Starts again.

167
00:25:00.929 --> 00:25:03.193
I'm sure the police are doing
everything in his power.


168
00:25:03.364 --> 00:25:04.695
Immediately after returning to advertising.

169
00:25:05.633 --> 00:25:07.601
Are you okay?

170
00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:09.566
Yes. I did.

171
00:26:01.623 --> 00:26:03.523
Come on, Tracy.

172
00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:05.749
Come.

173
00:26:42.897 --> 00:26:45.161
Tracy, you're staying here.

174
00:27:06.354 --> 00:27:07.651
Tracy, you're staying here.

175
00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:19.882
Hello, office management.
Jimmy here.


176
00:29:20.054 --> 00:29:23.956
Bye, Jimmy. Juèe I collided
with another car ...


177
00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:28.118
I do not think anything has been damaged, but I want
Tales from the owner to be in it look it up.


178
00:29:28.296 --> 00:29:31.459
Parking No.23.
Will you tell me whose is it?


179
00:29:31.632 --> 00:29:34.192
Everything you say, Mr. Harris dice.
Let's see.


180
00:29:34.368 --> 00:29:36.632
21, 22, 23 ...

181
00:29:39.607 --> 00:29:44.874
It belongs to Herbert Stanley, apartment
br.1204, above the north tower.


182
00:29:46.647 --> 00:29:48.376
Hello? G
-Dice Harris?

183
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:53.487
Br.1204?
- Yes, br.1204. You're almost neighbors.


184
00:29:54.956 --> 00:29:57.652
You should see one another.

185
00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:57.179
Halo. Roger, Rièardson and Mekgaven.

186
00:30:57.351 --> 00:31:00.013
I'm sorry, but all have gone tonight.

187
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:03.689
Is there someone there?

188
00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:05.954
Hello?

189
00:31:23.077 --> 00:31:24.305
Hello?

190
00:31:24.478 --> 00:31:26.446
It's you, Anet?

191
00:31:28.482 --> 00:31:32.316
Why not put it in your ears
and skoèiš from shore?


192
00:31:32.987 --> 00:31:35.478
Staviæu in you, Anet.

193
00:32:28.209 --> 00:32:31.007
This is our song, Anet.

194
00:32:31.178 --> 00:32:33.772
Why do not you leave me alone,
Would you?


195
00:32:33.948 --> 00:32:36.473
It does not interest me.
I will not hear that!


196
00:33:25.566 --> 00:33:27.727
Hello?
- Susan, I'm scared to death.


197
00:33:27.902 --> 00:33:29.961
Someone called me constantly.
- Anet?


198
00:33:30.137 --> 00:33:31.934
He knows my name
and know where I work.

199
00:33:32.106 --> 00:33:33.835
Hey, hey, calm down.
Are you okay?


200
00:33:34.008 --> 00:33:35.976
Listen, can not long endure.

201
00:33:36.143 --> 00:33:38.611
I was really scared.
Plays music.


202
00:33:38.779 --> 00:33:40.246
Music? What kind of music?

203
00:33:40.414 --> 00:33:43.281
I do not know. Zvuèilo as
some kind of a music box.


204
00:33:43.451 --> 00:33:45.715
You called the police? - No.
I did not want any trouble.


205
00:33:45.886 --> 00:33:49.413
Just want you to go from here.
Izluðuje me.


206
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.490
What are you doing?
Sam you tonight?


207
00:33:51.659 --> 00:33:54.355
Yes, as good devojèica.
- She followed that make you come here?


208
00:33:54.528 --> 00:33:57.190
Of course.
- Moving right away.


209
00:36:29.116 --> 00:36:31.641
Herbert. Stanley Herbert.
He had no belt on it.


210
00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:33.912
Can you imagine that a
Type in a suit of three parts ...


211
00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:36.147
And ... there is no belt on it?

212
00:36:36.524 --> 00:36:38.116
David, Are you listening?

213
00:36:38.292 --> 00:36:39.884
How it works?
- What?


214
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.028
To turn around just like that?

215
00:36:42.196 --> 00:36:45.063
It's like when you're not looking
obuješ when your shoes.


216
00:36:45.232 --> 00:36:46.460
It makes sense.

217
00:36:46.634 --> 00:36:49.159
Yes. Well, the guy has changed
their clothes in the garage ...


218
00:36:49.336 --> 00:36:51.497
... Before it's gone
up to the apartment.


219
00:36:51.672 --> 00:36:55.699
Ha? Come on. Maybe this guy,
Hjubert ... - Herbert.


220
00:36:55.876 --> 00:36:58.344
All right. Maybe this guy, Herbert ...

221
00:36:58.512 --> 00:37:00.275
Well, maybe marry a man ...

222
00:37:00.447 --> 00:37:02.915
And ... you know, maybe have a relationship with
another woman.


223
00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:04.448
Are you remembering this?

224
00:37:04.618 --> 00:37:07.485
Come on, this happened a few hours after
that, since they committed murder.


225
00:37:07.655 --> 00:37:09.452
and the girl was strangled with a belt.

226
00:37:09.623 --> 00:37:12.922
This is called indirect evidence.

227
00:37:13.093 --> 00:37:16.790
Look, if the police arrested
anyone who does not have a belt ...


228
00:37:16.964 --> 00:37:19.694
Cells ... soon to be filled and no
time for it. Well, what are you?


229
00:37:19.867 --> 00:37:22.836
His shirt. He had a stain.

230
00:37:23.003 --> 00:37:25.699
Well, maybe it is defiled.
- David ....


231
00:37:25.873 --> 00:37:28.933
There is no judge who would
him for this ...


232
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:31.077
... Sent to jail.

233
00:37:32.112 --> 00:37:34.307
Look, do not worry about it.

234
00:37:34.481 --> 00:37:37.041
Uhvatiæe the psychopath,
whoever that is.


235
00:37:37.218 --> 00:37:39.812
Types as he is always right
errors when a mistake ...


236
00:37:40.187 --> 00:37:41.518
You're a psychologist.

237
00:37:42.356 --> 00:37:46.087
I will not watch that muèiš
itself.


238
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:50.560
David, I promised myself that I will not allow
to Tracy anything happen again.


239
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:52.323
It does not matter what I must do.

240
00:37:52.967 --> 00:37:55.765
Before that poèneš
you take the law into their own hands,


241
00:37:55.936 --> 00:37:58.700
... Think for a minute.
Tracy already doing well for a while ...


242
00:37:58.872 --> 00:38:00.169
The building has ... been provided.

243
00:38:00.341 --> 00:38:04.778
Come on, you can not be serious.
No one is safe.


244
00:38:04.945 --> 00:38:06.310
You know you are.

245
00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:41.104
What is the problem?

246
00:39:41.275 --> 00:39:44.073
It rounds out there.
They should do something.


247
00:39:45.179 --> 00:39:48.080
Forget it.

248
00:40:01.261 --> 00:40:05.129
Damn. Can not this guy stay
the whole night. I'm going to push it.


249
00:40:05.299 --> 00:40:08.166
OK, but be quick.

250
00:40:08.335 --> 00:40:11.304
Yeah, okay.
Immediately returns.


251
00:40:40.033 --> 00:40:41.864
Hey, èoveèe, I think you
well there if you push ...


252
00:43:46.219 --> 00:43:47.311
Now you can go in there already.

253
00:43:54.728 --> 00:43:57.288
The analysis shows that oeni
nerves quite normal ...


254
00:43:57.464 --> 00:43:59.193
And ... no injuries to the head.

255
00:43:59.366 --> 00:44:01.960
I do not understand.
What is the problem with it?


256
00:44:02.436 --> 00:44:05.371
We are confident that her
brain has been damaged.


257
00:44:05.539 --> 00:44:09.475
Thank God.
- Then why not see or hear?


258
00:44:09.643 --> 00:44:11.873
It is not know for sure.

259
00:44:12.379 --> 00:44:15.075
She is my child, doctor.

260
00:44:15.248 --> 00:44:17.842
You must do something!

261
00:44:18.018 --> 00:44:19.918
Tracy!

262
00:44:58.659 --> 00:45:00.183
Hello?
- Jane, Roger here.


263
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.261
Right now èitam news.
Again it happened.


264
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.695
O.
- I thought do you want to know.


265
00:45:06.867 --> 00:45:09.392
Oh, when?
- Last night.


266
00:45:09.569 --> 00:45:13.027
The secretary went home from work.
He pulled her out of the car.


267
00:45:13.206 --> 00:45:16.573
They found five miles from the mine
stone, face down in the mud.


268
00:45:16.743 --> 00:45:18.643
There were two other murders in the vicinity.

269
00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:20.837
You said that they
found him in the mud?

270
00:45:21.014 --> 00:45:24.450
Yes. Why?
Nothing videæemo later.


271
00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:54.346
Information. Can you help?
- Yes.


272
00:45:54.514 --> 00:45:57.813
Can I get a number of Mr.
Herbert Stanley, please?


273
00:45:58.151 --> 00:46:02.485
Just a minute
Stanley Herbert, H-e-r-b-e-r-t ...


274
00:46:02.656 --> 00:46:05.648
... 822-1076.

275
00:47:27.007 --> 00:47:29.703
Good morning, Jimmy.
- A, Bye, Mr. Harris dice.


276
00:47:29.876 --> 00:47:31.844
Sit, please.
- Thank you.


277
00:47:32.012 --> 00:47:35.004
Hoæete kafesitu one?
- No, thank you.


278
00:47:35.182 --> 00:47:37.742
Soda machines are broken again.
Would you help me?


279
00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:39.215
Not a problem.

280
00:47:41.087 --> 00:47:44.022
Popraviæu for you.
- Oh, thank you.


281
00:47:47.427 --> 00:47:50.658
Damn you guys again, always
just touch the machine.


282
00:47:55.235 --> 00:47:58.363
He immediately returns with the juice.
Only in this way. Do not go away.


283
00:47:58.538 --> 00:47:59.835
All right.

284
00:48:01.107 --> 00:48:03.575
Potrajaæe just a minute.

285
00:53:38.144 --> 00:53:39.873
Oops ...

286
00:54:10.143 --> 00:54:12.577
I apologize.

287
00:54:21.087 --> 00:54:24.022
When you prièali with it,
Whether you seemed nervous?


288
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:26.852
Yes, she was nervous, but not
I believe that he ever believed ...


289
00:54:27.026 --> 00:54:29.153
That ... it was kind
imminent danger.


290
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:32.127
I want to say that we have previously
received such calls.


291
00:54:32.298 --> 00:54:34.858
Did you say something else,
maybe?


292
00:54:35.034 --> 00:54:36.934
I do not believe.

293
00:54:37.604 --> 00:54:39.196
Wait a moment ...

294
00:54:39.372 --> 00:54:41.067
It was mentioned ... something.

295
00:54:41.241 --> 00:54:44.301
She said that zastrašujuæe.
- What?


296
00:54:44.477 --> 00:54:48.311
It was some kind of music
in the background, as ...


297
00:54:48.715 --> 00:54:51.479
A music box ... or something.

298
00:54:51.651 --> 00:54:55.815
Stop here. This is a crazy question,
whether a cuckoo clock that plays ...


299
00:54:55.989 --> 00:54:57.422
Or ... can only kukuæe?

300
00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:00.787
I do not know. I do not see why
could not. Why?


301
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.760
No special reason.
May be in five, okay?


302
00:55:13.172 --> 00:55:17.905
Jane, you are late for 20 minutes.
- David, you will not believe me. David.


303
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:22.980
Stories of true love ...

304
00:55:23.449 --> 00:55:25.576
And ... intrikama.

305
00:55:29.222 --> 00:55:30.985
Take your part ...

306
00:55:31.157 --> 00:55:35.355
And ... I'll take everything
èoveèanstvo wants me to.


307
00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:39.989
David?
- What is it?


308
00:55:40.166 --> 00:55:42.657
I want something to show you.

309
00:55:45.138 --> 00:55:46.435
