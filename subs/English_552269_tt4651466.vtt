1
00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:29.096
Hey, Lola.

2
00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.186
Checking in from Idaho.

3
00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.754
Other than my right foot being
one gigantic blister, I'm okay.


4
00:01:35.798 --> 00:01:39.106
I'll just have to fight
through it.


5
00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.064
Fight it out, will it out.

6
00:01:41.108 --> 00:01:43.893
I'll call you again
from Twin Falls, okay?


7
00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.026
I miss you.
Hug Joseph for me.


8
00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:03.739
What the fuck?

9
00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:05.784
Fucking-
- You motherfucker!

10
00:02:05.828 --> 00:02:07.047
Hey, you all right?

11
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.700
Yeah, I'm all right.

12
00:02:08.744 --> 00:02:10.833
See, that's why you need
to do what Mom tells you to do.


13
00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:12.748
Walk against the traffic.
- What?


14
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.619
You're 15, all right?
I'm 45.


15
00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:16.404
You think I don't know
what I'm doing out here?


16
00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:19.059
No I don't.
That's why I'm with you.


17
00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:30.244
We... we have with us
tonight Joe Bell,


18
00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:32.246
all the way
from La Grande, Oregon.


19
00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.031
Joe's here to talk to us tonight
about tolerance.


20
00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:36.554
Let's, uh,
give him a round of applause.


21
00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:43.561
Uh...

22
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:46.564
Good afternoon.
Thanks for having me here.


23
00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:49.263
Uh...

24
00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:51.134
I jotted down
a couple of things


25
00:02:51.178 --> 00:02:53.963
I want to chat
with you guys about, um...


26
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.444
You know, a lot of people
don't think it's a big deal


27
00:02:56.487 --> 00:02:59.186
to make fun of other people...

28
00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:03.494
um, who are different
from you.


29
00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:06.236
You know, bullying
and intolerance


30
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.325
can have a deadly effect.

31
00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:10.719
And I'm here because
I'm walking across America


32
00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:12.286
on behalf of my son, Jadin,

33
00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.766
to speak out against bullying.

34
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.465
All right?
Now it's important--


35
00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:20.032
Is it okay
if I take this?


36
00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:23.166
I don't want to break it.

37
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.387
You know, it's important
for people to understand,


38
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.522
or understand how hurtful it
is to harass and torment people


39
00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:35.439
who aren't the same as you.

40
00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:38.050
And that understanding begins
at home


41
00:03:38.094 --> 00:03:39.965
with the parents
and families.


42
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:41.663
All right?

43
00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:43.708
Parents out there, just let
your kids be who they are,


44
00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:45.406
and it'll all be fine.

45
00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.451
You tell them you love them
no matter what, all right?


46
00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:48.887
Because that's what they need
to know.


47
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:50.193
All right?

48
00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:52.021
Anybody have any questions
for me?


49
00:03:55.503 --> 00:03:57.113
No?

50
00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.770
Okay, well please
follow me on Facebook


51
00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:04.425
and share my message
with your friends.


52
00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:06.601
Thank you, guys.

53
00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:09.691
Thank you.

54
00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:20.832
Shit. Hey!

55
00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:23.139
Yeah? Why won't this thing work?

56
00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:25.489
Come on.

57
00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:26.838
You need any help?

58
00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:28.666
I'm done now.

59
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.277
I'm useless.
- Get in, get in, get in.


60
00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:34.281
I'm laying here with you?

61
00:04:34.324 --> 00:04:37.066
Yeah. You're stuck with me.

62
00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:38.459
Get your feet off my pillow!

63
00:04:38.502 --> 00:04:40.722
#Oh, shit! Whoa!

64
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.576
What was that last night, huh?

65
00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:11.100
'Understanding
begins at home'?


66
00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:14.843
Whose home? Not ours.

67
00:05:14.886 --> 00:05:16.236
That's the way it was.

68
00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.673
No, not for me it wasn't.

69
00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.850
'Just be who you are
and it'll all be fine.'


70
00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:24.505
How can you say that
when you know it's a lie?


71
00:05:24.548 --> 00:05:26.898
Look at that resolution
on this bad boy.


72
00:05:26.942 --> 00:05:28.683
I see it.
- Huh?


73
00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:30.772
Big TV.
- Oh, yeah.


74
00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:32.077
Hey, don't worry,

75
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:33.992
the washing machine's
coming next.


76
00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:35.994
Yeah, I'm not gonna
hold my breath on that!


77
00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:38.823
Hey, I'm getting one of these.
- Don't hook up the VHS.


78
00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:40.347
We ain't gonna use
that shit.


79
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.913
Well, there's plenty of holes
back there.


80
00:05:41.957 --> 00:05:43.524
Hey.
#What?


81
00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:44.829
Get out of the way, man.

82
00:05:44.873 --> 00:05:47.484
All right, what can I get
anybody?


83
00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:48.964
Hey, come on. Hey.
- What?


84
00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:50.792
Sit with me for a few minutes
and enjoy this.


85
00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:53.925
No, game time's in an hour.
The food can wait, come on.


86
00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.798
Hey, Dad, can I talk to you
for a minute?


87
00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:59.366
What?
#He needs to talk to you.


88
00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.803
Honey, I'm talking to you.
- Can I please talk to you just--


89
00:06:01.846 --> 00:06:03.718
Now?
- Yes, now.


90
00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:06.547
You've got to be shitting me.
All right, then, talk to me.


91
00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:13.293
Can we please talk outside
or out back?


92
00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:16.470
You gotta be shitting me.
Hey, don't touch the remote.


93
00:06:16.513 --> 00:06:17.688
All right.

94
00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:21.301
Well?

95
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.478
Well?
- Can you just give me a second.


96
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:26.088
That goddamn TV ain't gonna
watch itself.


97
00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:27.698
Well, Mom already knows.

98
00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:31.006
Knows what? What?

99
00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:33.530
Knows that I'm getting picked
on by these guys at school.


100
00:06:35.097 --> 00:06:36.272
Why is that?

101
00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:41.756
I don't know,
because I'm not like them?


102
00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:43.801
It's gotta be more than that.
That doesn't make sense.


103
00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:45.499
Why aren't you like them?
- Because I'm just--


104
00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:47.675
I'm different. I'm just...
- Because why?


105
00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:50.242
Because I'm not like them.
- That's not an answer, Jadin.


106
00:06:50.286 --> 00:06:52.070
Doesn't make any sense.
- Because I'm gay.


107
00:07:07.738 --> 00:07:09.697
You remember when I took
you boys to the Y?


108
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.394
Hmm?
- I put boxing gloves on you both


109
00:07:11.438 --> 00:07:12.961
and made you duke it out.

110
00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:14.876
You need to know how to clean
anybody's clock.


111
00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.618
Anybody that messes with you.
Didn't I teach you anything?


112
00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:26.540
I don't want to spend
my high school


113
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.585
duking it out with guys
who just don't agree with me.


114
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:30.282
I can fight someone
one on one,


115
00:07:30.326 --> 00:07:32.067
but I can't fight
an entire school.


116
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.243
Well, if I got to go down there
and kick the fuck


117
00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:35.940
out of them little
sons of bitches, I will!


118
00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:41.903
You know what? We're gonna let
nature take its course.


119
00:07:41.946 --> 00:07:43.644
All right?

120
00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:46.473
This isn't anybody else's
business anyway, is it?


121
00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:48.475
Don't talk about it
with the other kids.


122
00:07:48.518 --> 00:07:50.520
Or with other people.
You mind your own damn business.


123
00:07:50.564 --> 00:07:52.087
It'll all be fine.
It'll work itself out.


124
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.523
Joe.

125
00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:55.220
#What?
- It's not gonna work itself out.


126
00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:57.266
#What am I supposed to do?
- Not talking about it


127
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.137
is not gonna help.
#It's gonna be fine.


128
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:01.575
#None of this is his fault.
#I didn't say that it was.


129
00:08:01.618 --> 00:08:05.622
The only thing he needs to know
is that his family loves him.


130
00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:07.929
This family loves you.
- You're stating the obvious here.


131
00:08:07.972 --> 00:08:10.192
It's not that obvious.
You can say it too, you know.


132
00:08:11.802 --> 00:08:13.238
He knows I love him.

133
00:08:14.457 --> 00:08:16.546
I love you. You...

134
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.505
You know that.

135
00:08:21.638 --> 00:08:22.813
Are we done here now?

136
00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:39.874
Here you go.

137
00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:41.789
You fucking with my settings?

138
00:08:41.832 --> 00:08:45.270
I was just trying to see
if I could figure it out.


139
00:08:45.314 --> 00:08:47.142
Lola!

140
00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:50.450
I'm getting a beer.

141
00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:05.595
Hey, just don't get all
bent out of shape about it, Joe.


142
00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.857
He's just a kid.

143
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:08.337
What's that supposed to mean?

144
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.818
I mean, so he's playing
a little grab-ass,


145
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:13.342
stirring up some trouble.
It's not a big deal.


146
00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.039
What are you trying to say,
this is a phase?


147
00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:17.085
The point is, I know
what he's in for now, all right?


148
00:09:17.128 --> 00:09:19.304
I just don't want him out there
damn near broadcasting it.


149
00:09:19.348 --> 00:09:21.872
You know where we live.
#I know.


150
00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:24.919
I'm just saying, kids are
designed to drive you nuts.


151
00:09:24.962 --> 00:09:27.487
He might just grow out of it.

152
00:09:30.228 --> 00:09:32.970
Go, Cougars!

153
00:09:33.014 --> 00:09:35.407
Let's go, Cougars!

154
00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:39.542
Let's go, Cougars!

155
00:09:39.586 --> 00:09:42.502
What in the hell?
Hey, Lola, come here.


156
00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.287
#What?
- Come here!


157
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.245
I'm coming. What is it?

158
00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:48.638
You tell me.
What is this?


159
00:09:48.682 --> 00:09:51.249
What? He's practicing
his cheers.


160
00:09:51.293 --> 00:09:53.556
He's just going to do his cheers
out there in the front yard?


161
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.210
We told him he could
join the squad--


162
00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:56.777
But in the front yard?

163
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.475
Let him be, Joe.
It's his first game this week.


164
00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:01.477
Why not?
- Hell no, hell no. No, no, no.


165
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:02.696
Joe-
- Joe.

166
00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:04.132
Mm-hmm.
#Joe.


167
00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:07.265
#Front yard.
- Oh, for God's sakes.


168
00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:08.745
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!Hey, son?

169
00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:10.094
Yeah?
- Could you--


170
00:10:10.138 --> 00:10:11.661
Would you mind practicing
in the backyard?


171
00:10:11.705 --> 00:10:12.923
It's hard for me
to hear the TV.


172
00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:14.142
What?

173
00:10:16.274 --> 00:10:17.537
You're out in front here
yelling.


174
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.321
And I can't hear
the television.


175
00:10:19.364 --> 00:10:22.106
Can you not just turn it up?
- Don't tell me what to do.


176
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.239
Your mother and I been
supporting this cheerleading,


177
00:10:24.282 --> 00:10:25.762
but you need to practice
in the backyard.


178
00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:27.198
What's his problem?

179
00:10:27.242 --> 00:10:28.722
Why can't we just
practice in the front?


180
00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:30.288
Get your ass
in the backyard now.


181
00:10:30.332 --> 00:10:31.638
Can't you ever
just shut the fuck up


182
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:33.074
and do what you're told?

183
00:10:33.117 --> 00:10:34.597
I thought my home life
was unstable.


184
00:10:35.946 --> 00:10:37.905
Go ahead. Follow Marcie.

185
00:10:43.345 --> 00:10:45.434
You better tell Marcie to stop
running her mouth,


186
00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:47.654
or I'm gonna put a foot
in her ass.


187
00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:49.394
Oh, okay.

188
00:10:53.703 --> 00:10:56.401
Come here. Come sit with me.

189
00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:57.577
I'm doing my crossword.

190
00:11:50.891 --> 00:11:52.414
I'm going to try to be better.

191
00:11:57.767 --> 00:11:58.942
I love you.

192
00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:02.772
I love you too.

193
00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:05.253
I know.

194
00:12:14.262 --> 00:12:16.699
I got to give you credit, Dad.
At least you're persistent.


195
00:12:16.743 --> 00:12:18.745
Well, I'm walking all this way

196
00:12:18.788 --> 00:12:21.095
because that's where you told us
you wanted to live, remember?


197
00:12:21.138 --> 00:12:23.010
Oh, yeah. New York City.

198
00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:25.142
Yeah, your big dream.

199
00:12:25.186 --> 00:12:27.971
Mm-hmm. I mean,
obviously.


200
00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.365
Why obviously?

201
00:12:30.408 --> 00:12:32.976
Why not? Think about it,
if you were me,


202
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.633
would you rather live
in La Grande or New York City?


203
00:12:37.677 --> 00:12:40.201
Well, I bet you'll feel more
comfortable in New York.


204
00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:41.985
Yeah. I'm sure you're right.
That's the point.


205
00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:43.421
All right, well,
just for the record,


206
00:12:43.465 --> 00:12:44.858
I happen to love
La Grande.


207
00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:46.250
So, you know,
why don't you just--


208
00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:48.688
Okay, no, uh-uh.
There's no comparison.


209
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:50.733
There's no comparison.
- Well, I...


210
00:12:50.777 --> 00:12:53.649
Okay, what does La Grande have?

211
00:12:53.693 --> 00:12:56.130
Nothing. Exactly.
What does New York have?


212
00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:58.785
It has every kind
of food,


213
00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:01.657
every kind of people,
every kind of pizza.


214
00:13:01.701 --> 00:13:03.267
We got pizza in La Grande.

215
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:06.749
It's got skyscrapers
and Broadway and...
- Stefani.


216
00:13:06.793 --> 00:13:08.098
I mean, hello?
Stefani.


217
00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:09.709
Who's Stefani?

218
00:13:09.752 --> 00:13:11.841
Stefani Joanne Angelina
Germanotta.


219
00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:15.105
What? Who is that?

220
00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:17.717
Gaga, Dad.
- Oh.


221
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.196
Lady Gaga.

222
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.590
Yeah, yeah.
- And, you know, of course--


223
00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:23.157
Of course she's proud
of how she grew up.


224
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.637
I mean, she grew up
in New York.


225
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:27.770
Only a New Yorker
could write that song.


226
00:13:27.814 --> 00:13:29.076
Well, don't start.

227
00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:30.468
Oh, come on.
You know you love it.

Little monster.

Overheard you
talking over here.


279
00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:48.911
I'm on a walk for change
for my son Jadin.


280
00:15:48.955 --> 00:15:50.260
And, uh...

281
00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:51.522
I'd like you to check out

a chance, thanks.

00:15:55.483 --> 00:15:56.876
I'll pass on the meal.

285
00:16:01.054 --> 00:16:03.404
I don't know what the fuck
that's all about.


286
00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:09.758
Dad.
- Don't start your shit, Jadin.


287
00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:13.675
Dad!What?

288
00:16:13.718 --> 00:16:16.330
Giving them a card and running
away isn't gonna change shit.


289
00:16:16.373 --> 00:16:18.375
I'm sorry,
but it's not.


290
00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:19.942
I don't know if you
realize this or not,


291
00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:21.161
but this is America, okay?

292
00:16:21.204 --> 00:16:22.510
And they're Americans.

293
00:16:22.553 --> 00:16:24.251
They are entitled
to their own opinion.


294

Okay, I'm starving
my ass off, okay?

296
00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:29.517

and on my walk.


297
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.084
Which I am doing for you,
remember?


298
00:16:31.127 --> 00:16:32.999
I mean, what else the hell--

299
00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:35.305
What else in the hell do you
expect from me, for chrissakes?


300
00:16:35.349 --> 00:16:37.525
The people that come
to your talks aren't the issue.


301
00:16:37.568 --> 00:16:39.048
They are.

302
00:16:39.092 --> 00:16:40.745
Really?

303
00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:42.922
Guys like that and their kids.
That's the issue.


304
00:16:42.965 --> 00:16:44.749
I hate to break it to you,

305
00:16:44.793 --> 00:16:47.230
but we wouldn't be hauling
our asses cross-country on foot


306
00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:49.929
if you'd actually done what I
told you to in the first place.


307
00:16:49.972 --> 00:16:52.627
You told me to fight,
which you didn't do.


308
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.281
And?
- You're a hypocrite.


309
00:16:54.324 --> 00:16:56.152
I'm the hypocrite?
- Don't want to be a hypocrite,


310
00:16:56.196 --> 00:16:57.937
then go back in there
and kick their asses.


311
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.113
Oh, I'm sorry, give them
another card and say bye.


312
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.409
Yes, I agree.

313
00:17:35.452 --> 00:17:36.801
Very, very.

314
00:17:36.845 --> 00:17:38.368
Oh, who are we
talking about?


315
00:17:55.472 --> 00:17:57.518
They're so loud.

316
00:17:57.561 --> 00:18:00.216
Oh, my gosh,
he's so hot.


317
00:18:03.089 --> 00:18:04.612
Guys, guys, guys.

318
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.875
Yeah.

319
00:18:20.236 --> 00:18:21.759
You guys want to come over?

320
00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:23.065
#Jerk!

321
00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:24.675
First down, faggot!

322
00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:27.504
You guys are such assholes.

323
00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:28.897
Takes one to know one.

324
00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:46.784
Chug, chug!

325
00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.409
Get a drink.

326
00:19:03.888 --> 00:19:05.412
I do.
- Really?


327
00:19:26.955 --> 00:19:28.609
She has had so many drinks.

328
00:19:40.708 --> 00:19:42.231
Wanna smoke?

329
00:19:50.196 --> 00:19:52.154
#Go, go.
- Right now?


330
00:19:52.198 --> 00:19:54.113
Yes, go. Hurry.
- Okay.


331
00:20:21.227 --> 00:20:22.445
I didn't know
you smoked.


332
00:20:22.489 --> 00:20:25.013
Yeah, we're not
supposed to.


333
00:20:27.146 --> 00:20:28.712
Don't tell coach, okay?

334
00:20:28.756 --> 00:20:30.932
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.


335
00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:40.811
Is it?

336
00:20:45.207 --> 00:20:46.339
Yeah.

337
00:21:09.797 --> 00:21:11.451
You jerk, where are you
taking me?


338
00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:23.332
You kissed a football player?

339
00:21:23.376 --> 00:21:25.508
Mm-hmm.

340
00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:28.946
Uh, no, technically
he's a running back.


341
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.513
What's that?

342
00:21:30.557 --> 00:21:33.690
I don't know, actually.

343
00:21:33.734 --> 00:21:36.258
This is, like, the stuff
dreams are made of.


344
00:21:36.302 --> 00:21:37.520
I know.

345
00:21:37.564 --> 00:21:39.000
How was the kiss?

346
00:21:39.043 --> 00:21:40.480
Can we not talk
about this right now?


347
00:21:40.523 --> 00:21:42.221
You wanna go to my room
and talk about this?


348
00:21:42.264 --> 00:21:44.440
Yeah, I want to talk about this.
I want to talk about this.


349
00:21:44.484 --> 00:21:46.964
Warmer?
- Okay, come on.


350
00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:51.055
Second and ten
on the 45-yard line.


351
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.626
Here we go, Cougars.
Here we go.


352
00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.545
Let's go, Cougars!

353
00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:07.289
Let's go...

354
00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:09.117
Do a good job, Chance. Let's go.

355
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.467
Come on, Chance! Go, number 5!

356
00:22:11.511 --> 00:22:13.382
Whoo!

357
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.647
Whoo!

358
00:22:17.691 --> 00:22:20.041
Yeah! Whoo!

359
00:22:24.524 --> 00:22:27.614
Hey, Bell,
did you forget your skirt?


360
00:22:29.355 --> 00:22:30.791
Whoo!

361
00:22:34.925 --> 00:22:36.275
Hey, ass bandit!

362
00:22:40.496 --> 00:22:41.758
Is that a boy down there?

363
00:22:41.802 --> 00:22:44.979
What the hell
is the school thinking?


364
00:22:45.022 --> 00:22:46.197
Hike!

365
00:23:00.168 --> 00:23:01.648
Touchdown, Cougars!

366
00:23:15.226 --> 00:23:17.316
A 30-yard pass to number 40...

367
00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:19.970
Let's go, Cougars!

368
00:23:20.014 --> 00:23:22.321
Let's go, Cougars!

369
00:23:23.452 --> 00:23:26.063
Let's go, Cougars!Whoo!

370
00:24:04.058 --> 00:24:06.016
I saw what they said about you.

371
00:24:08.367 --> 00:24:10.194
Doesn't it bother you
what people say?


372
00:24:13.807 --> 00:24:15.112
Words can't hurt me.

373
00:24:16.984 --> 00:24:20.248
I'm tougher than I look,
okay?


374
00:24:40.224 --> 00:24:41.617
Look at these mountains.

375
00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:42.879
They're so steep.

376
00:24:42.923 --> 00:24:44.228
Yeah.

377
00:24:44.272 --> 00:24:46.927
If we had more time,
we'd hike them.


378
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.494
You can see why
I always wanted you


379
00:24:48.537 --> 00:24:50.321
to go hunting and fishing
with me.


380
00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:52.759
Take you up there and get you
away from everything down below.


381
00:24:52.802 --> 00:24:54.456
Yeah, real macho stuff.

382
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.371
I was just trying to be
a decent parent.


383
00:24:56.415 --> 00:24:57.851
I mean, I thought
being out in the wild


384
00:24:57.894 --> 00:24:59.069
would help you be a man.

385
00:25:00.941 --> 00:25:03.117
What does that mean to you,
'be a man'? I'm just curious.


386
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.293
I did the same thing for Joseph
for the same reason,


387
00:25:05.336 --> 00:25:06.816
and he's not gay.

388
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.340
It didn't matter to you
what I was okay with,


389
00:25:09.384 --> 00:25:11.560
especially after you started
your cheerleading thing.


390
00:25:11.604 --> 00:25:13.954
I mean, Dad, some men
like cheerleading


391
00:25:13.997 --> 00:25:15.434
and some men like hiking.

392
00:25:15.477 --> 00:25:16.913
And I think if we're...

393
00:25:16.957 --> 00:25:18.741
I don't know,
if we're being honest,


394
00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:21.483
you were never really okay
with me cheerleading, were you?


395
00:25:21.527 --> 00:25:22.745
No, if we're being honest,

396
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:24.138
if you thought
you could handle it,


397
00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:25.356
I knew different.

398
00:25:27.533 --> 00:25:31.101
I mean, you saw me cheer,
like, once?


399
00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:34.322
The one time you did, you left.
- What?


400
00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:36.367
People were calling me names
and throwing stuff at me,


401
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:38.152
and you got up and left.
- I was afraid for you.


402
00:25:38.195 --> 00:25:40.589
We were all afraid for you.

403
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.954
Well, I worked
two shifts today.


404
00:26:00.174 --> 00:26:04.483
And then I came home
to do some laundry,


405
00:26:04.526 --> 00:26:07.660
and the laundry machine
finally just fucking died.


406
00:26:09.183 --> 00:26:10.576
But with a whole load
of clothes in,


407
00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:12.403
it wouldn't drain.

408
00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:15.145
I mean, it was...
it was such a mess.


409
00:26:15.189 --> 00:26:16.625
Well, I'm sorry about all that,

410
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:18.888
but there's not much
I can do from out here.


411
00:26:22.283 --> 00:26:23.980
There's really not much
you could do


412
00:26:24.024 --> 00:26:26.505
if you were standing
right in front of me.


413
00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:30.683
I'm right about that.

414
00:26:31.858 --> 00:26:34.469
You know you should just
call us


415
00:26:34.513 --> 00:26:38.821
at the same time every week,
you know?


416
00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:42.695
Just set it so we know
that we're gonna hear from you.


417
00:26:42.738 --> 00:26:45.436
Look, Lola...

418
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.438
I'm afraid for Joseph
with you drinking again.


419
00:26:47.482 --> 00:26:50.398
I mean, I want to trust things
are okay while I'm gone,


420
00:26:50.441 --> 00:26:52.531
but you're damn near
slurring every other word.


421
00:26:52.574 --> 00:26:54.837
Joseph doesn't need to see that.
#Wait, what? Wait.


422
00:26:54.881 --> 00:26:56.535
What is-- What is--
What is so difficult


423
00:26:56.578 --> 00:26:57.797
about what I just asked?

424
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.189
Well, I know
that you drink a lot,


425
00:26:59.233 --> 00:27:00.974
and so does Marcie
and Joseph.


426
00:27:01.017 --> 00:27:02.628
Can't you just stop
with one damn drink?


427
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:04.238
What, you gotta have
five or ten of them?


428
00:27:04.281 --> 00:27:07.110
Joe, you're not here.

429
00:27:07.154 --> 00:27:10.331
You have no idea
what's going on.


430
00:27:10.374 --> 00:27:12.072
No idea.

431
00:27:17.643 --> 00:27:19.558
So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna go to bed?


432
00:27:19.601 --> 00:27:21.298
Oh, no, I dipped into
our retirement savings


433
00:27:21.342 --> 00:27:22.865
so I could splurge
on a presidential suite


434
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:24.084
at the Bear River Inn.

435
00:27:30.351 --> 00:27:32.309
Right.

436
00:27:32.353 --> 00:27:34.964
Well, love you.

437
00:27:35.008 --> 00:27:36.183
I love you.

438
00:27:47.063 --> 00:27:49.979
Hey. Hey.

439
00:27:50.023 --> 00:27:51.241
What?
- Come here.


440
00:27:51.285 --> 00:27:52.634
What?
- It's gold!


441
00:27:52.678 --> 00:27:54.418
Gold, baby!

442
00:27:54.462 --> 00:27:56.072
#What?
#Whoo!


443
00:27:56.116 --> 00:27:59.162
Green gold, baby.
Look at these bad boys.


444
00:27:59.206 --> 00:28:01.338
Look at the size of them. Huh?

445
00:28:01.382 --> 00:28:03.166
Is that asparagus?
- Oh, man.


446
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.516
I'm gonna grill them up on
the fire, you are gonna love it.


447
00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.083
Ain't nothing better
than wild asparagus.


448
00:28:07.127 --> 00:28:08.955
Oh, that smells so good.
#Oh, yeah.


449
00:28:08.998 --> 00:28:10.652
That's the real deal
right there, baby.


450
00:28:10.696 --> 00:28:13.350
#Yeah, man.
#This is green gold. Whoo!


451
00:28:22.925 --> 00:28:24.405
Nothing better.

452
00:28:24.448 --> 00:28:26.233
Right out of the ground.
Taste that.


453
00:28:30.629 --> 00:28:32.282
That's so good.

454
00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:33.806
Give me more of that.
You're hogging it.


455
00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:35.242
I haven't had a bite yet.

456
00:28:35.285 --> 00:28:36.939
What the heck?

457
00:28:36.983 --> 00:28:38.724
Here, get one.
- Just make sure it's cooked.


458
00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:40.073
I don't want you eating
nothing raw.


459
00:28:44.033 --> 00:28:47.123
You know, this is the one thing
you can cook.


460
00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:58.395
Did you ever wish
that I wrestled?


461
00:28:58.439 --> 00:29:00.789
No. You didn't want to wrestle,
you didn't have to wrestle.


462
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:04.271
Joseph's gotten really good.

463
00:29:04.314 --> 00:29:06.099
You know why's good at it?
- Why?


464
00:29:06.142 --> 00:29:07.666
Because he works hard at it.

465
00:29:07.709 --> 00:29:09.450
You put the time in...

466
00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:13.584
you get good at whatever
you work hard at.


467
00:29:13.628 --> 00:29:14.934
That's all about sacrifice.

468
00:29:19.068 --> 00:29:20.591
Trying to get
this one big one here.


469
00:29:32.473 --> 00:29:34.214
Whoo!

470
00:29:34.257 --> 00:29:35.824
Yeah, buddy!

471
00:29:40.873 --> 00:29:42.875
Let's go, Cougars,
let's go!


472
00:29:42.918 --> 00:29:46.792
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!
Come on!


473
00:29:46.835 --> 00:29:49.359
Come on. Come out here.
It feels great.


474
00:29:49.403 --> 00:29:51.535
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!
Argh.


475
00:29:52.711 --> 00:29:54.147
I will keep you up all night.

476
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.366
Let's go, Cougars!
Let's go!


477
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.805
Let's go, grandpa.
Come on.


478
00:29:59.848 --> 00:30:02.111
Let's go, Cougars! Let's go!!
Argh!


479
00:30:02.155 --> 00:30:03.809
All right, show me again.
- All right, ready?


480
00:30:03.852 --> 00:30:05.506
Yeah.
- Watch.


481
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:07.595
Let's go, Cougars, let's go!

482
00:30:07.638 --> 00:30:09.336
Argh!Argh!

483
00:30:17.692 --> 00:30:19.259
Whoo!

484
00:30:39.932 --> 00:30:42.195
How many yards did you
rush for in last night's game?


485
00:30:42.238 --> 00:30:43.457
Uh...

486
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.241
158.

487
00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:52.771
Is that a lot, or...?

488
00:30:56.252 --> 00:30:58.994
If you don't know,
why are you asking?


489
00:30:59.038 --> 00:31:01.127
I want to know
about your game.


490
00:31:02.911 --> 00:31:05.827
Um... yeah.

491
00:31:05.871 --> 00:31:08.221
Yeah, I mean,

492
00:31:08.264 --> 00:31:11.050
Um, it's below my average,
though, but...


493
00:31:12.834 --> 00:31:15.837
you know, I don't need
to be a star or anything.


494
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:17.839
I just want to get
into a small program


495
00:31:17.883 --> 00:31:19.319
and play football
somewhere.


496
00:31:23.105 --> 00:31:25.107
Like where?

497
00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:26.674
Um...

498
00:31:26.717 --> 00:31:28.850
well, I'm not really,
you know,


499
00:31:28.894 --> 00:31:30.765
D-1 material.

500
00:31:30.809 --> 00:31:32.985
But I don't know.

501
00:31:33.028 --> 00:31:35.291
Like Portland State,
maybe?


502
00:31:35.335 --> 00:31:36.727
Maybe Eastern Washington.

503
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.518
That's a long way away
from where I'll be.


504
00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:46.912
Hmm. And where's that?

505
00:31:46.955 --> 00:31:48.130
New York.

506
00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:52.743
You know there's a lot
of colleges in New York.


507
00:31:57.923 --> 00:31:59.446
And if you wanted to...

508
00:32:01.404 --> 00:32:02.579
I don't know, go east...

509
00:32:06.018 --> 00:32:07.976
we could go together.

510
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.717
Or something.

511
00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:18.334
I don't know, Jadin.
That's aiming pretty high.


512
00:32:24.775 --> 00:32:26.081
He, uh...

513
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:28.431
he got freaked out.

514
00:32:31.521 --> 00:32:33.088
He was afraid
that he'd get kicked out


515
00:32:33.132 --> 00:32:35.308
if his moron parents knew.

516
00:32:40.661 --> 00:32:42.881
Romantic relationships
aren't everything, Jadin.


517
00:32:42.924 --> 00:32:45.187
They're not the solution
to life.


518
00:32:45.231 --> 00:32:47.755
It was the solution to my life.

519
00:32:47.798 --> 00:32:50.671
My life, Dad.
Not yours. Mine.


520
00:33:28.883 --> 00:33:30.058
Nervous, huh?

521
00:33:30.102 --> 00:33:32.887
No. Why would I be nervous?

522
00:33:32.931 --> 00:33:34.671
What if somebody
hits on you?


523
00:33:34.715 --> 00:33:36.282
Nobody's gonna
hit on me.


524
00:33:36.325 --> 00:33:38.893
It's a gay bar, Dad.

525
00:33:38.937 --> 00:33:40.764
Somebody's gonna hit on you.
- How would you know?


526
00:33:40.808 --> 00:33:42.157
Ever been to a gay bar?
- No, but--


527
00:33:42.201 --> 00:33:43.767
Have you ever been to a bar?
#No.


528
00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:44.986
Okay, then.

529
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.466
Also, it's drag night,

530
00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:47.728
so you better dance.

531
00:33:47.771 --> 00:33:49.338
I don't dance.

532
00:33:49.382 --> 00:33:52.298
I cannot wait to see my dad,
the magnificent Joe Bell,


533
00:33:52.341 --> 00:33:54.343
working it with some
fierce lady queens.


534
00:33:54.387 --> 00:33:56.215
That's not gonna happen.
You're staying here.


535
00:33:56.258 --> 00:33:57.868
Okay, well, at least say hi
to Cher for me.


536
00:33:57.912 --> 00:33:59.653
Cher?
- Mm-hmm. There's always a Cher.


537
00:33:59.696 --> 00:34:01.133
It's a given.
- How would you know?


538
00:34:01.176 --> 00:34:03.265
Because. It's a given.

539
00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:05.267
And if she flirts with you,
try not to be mean.


540
00:34:05.311 --> 00:34:06.965
Why would I be mean?

541
00:34:07.008 --> 00:34:08.792
I mean, who the hell
do you think I am?


542
00:34:08.836 --> 00:34:10.142
Would you flirt back?

543
00:34:10.185 --> 00:34:11.795
No, I would not, Jadin.
#Why not?


544
00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:14.015
Because.
- Because why?


545
00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:16.017
Because Cher's not my type.

546
00:34:16.061 --> 00:34:17.976
Now, if Dolly's there...
#No.


547
00:34:18.019 --> 00:34:20.108
...I'm gonna motorboat
them big-ass titties.


548
00:34:22.023 --> 00:34:24.243
You are disgusting.

549
00:34:26.027 --> 00:34:28.551
Dad...
- What?


550
00:34:28.595 --> 00:34:31.076
Relax. You got this.

551
00:34:32.381 --> 00:34:34.296
You know that's my job.

552
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.645
To reassure you.

553
00:34:37.517 --> 00:34:39.084
Yeah, I wish I could
go with you.


554
00:34:39.127 --> 00:34:40.650
Yeah, well, so do I.

555
00:34:44.263 --> 00:34:45.829
Well, wish me luck.

556
00:34:45.873 --> 00:34:47.614
Good luck.
- Give me a hug.


557
00:34:47.657 --> 00:34:48.832
All right.

558
00:34:56.144 --> 00:34:58.364
How do I look?

559
00:34:58.407 --> 00:35:00.018
Pants tight enough
but not too tight?


560
00:35:00.061 --> 00:35:02.150
Oh, God, Dad!I'm gonna keep the flaps down.

561
00:35:02.194 --> 00:35:04.239
Stop buying the time.
Get out of here.


562
00:35:04.283 --> 00:35:05.501
Go. Good luck.
- Bye.


563
00:35:05.545 --> 00:35:06.720
Bye.

564
00:35:33.181 --> 00:35:35.966
Our folks are deeply religious.

565
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:39.187
I was 15, and I was a deacon
at our church.


566
00:35:39.231 --> 00:35:42.016
I was sitting at church
with my family,


567
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.280
and the sermon that day
was on sins against God.


568
00:35:45.324 --> 00:35:49.415
And when he said,
'gays are going to hell,'


569
00:35:49.458 --> 00:35:52.113
I couldn't take it anymore.

570
00:35:52.157 --> 00:35:55.682
I got up and I-I-I
went to leave,


571
00:35:55.725 --> 00:35:57.901
and my mom stopped me and
she said, 'Where are you going?'


572
00:35:57.945 --> 00:36:00.382
And I turned and I said
'To hell, apparently.'


573
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.345
It's seems funny now, but-
-It was funny.

574
00:36:08.216 --> 00:36:11.132
At the time it was like
an avalanche had hit.


575
00:36:11.176 --> 00:36:14.570
My entire life was hell.

576
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.706
It's hard to stand strong

577
00:36:19.749 --> 00:36:23.144
in places where there are more
churches than there are gays.


578
00:36:23.188 --> 00:36:25.581
Churches, man.
Don't even get me started.


579
00:36:25.625 --> 00:36:27.801
Jadin went to church with
a friend of his one Sunday.


580
00:36:27.844 --> 00:36:29.455
I mean, he was hoping
he'd make some friends


581
00:36:29.498 --> 00:36:31.239
and find a place where people
would be kind.


582
00:36:31.283 --> 00:36:33.502
During the service, the pastor
singled him out and said,


583
00:36:33.546 --> 00:36:35.896
'If you are gay, you must come
up here to the altar


584
00:36:35.939 --> 00:36:38.464
and repent your sins,
or leave.'


585
00:36:38.507 --> 00:36:41.162
Jaden told us it made him feel
horrible, like he didn't belong.


586
00:36:41.206 --> 00:36:43.643
You got them Catholic Church
taking child molesting priests,


587
00:36:43.686 --> 00:36:45.558
they move them from one
church to another


588
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:47.821
so they can molest other boys,
and they won't accept my son


589
00:36:47.864 --> 00:36:49.649
because he's openly gay?
I mean, the idea is


590
00:36:49.692 --> 00:36:52.956
you're supposed to worship
the guy who died to build it,


591
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.828
not the frigging assholes
in there


592
00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:56.656
that are judging everybody
doing God knows what


593
00:36:56.699 --> 00:36:58.919
behind closed doors.
#It's true.


594
00:37:00.486 --> 00:37:02.488
People think it's easier
these days.


595
00:37:02.531 --> 00:37:05.186
But everyone in this bar knows
that's not necessarily true.


596
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.275
That's why they come here.

597
00:37:07.319 --> 00:37:10.496
This place is like
a church too.


598
00:37:10.539 --> 00:37:12.106
I think it's amazing.

599
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.629
Hi, darlings.

600
00:37:13.673 --> 00:37:15.240
It's almost
showtime again.


601
00:37:15.283 --> 00:37:17.633
Oh, my God, who is this?

602
00:37:17.677 --> 00:37:19.896
Don't make me
introduce myself.


603
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.029
This is Joe Bell.

604
00:37:22.072 --> 00:37:24.988
Where have you been
all my life?


605
00:37:26.425 --> 00:37:27.730
He's just visiting.
- Oh, perfect.


606
00:37:27.774 --> 00:37:29.645
Well, if you need
a place to crash,


607
00:37:29.689 --> 00:37:31.299
there's room on my couch.

608
00:37:31.343 --> 00:37:33.780
Or my bed.

609
00:37:33.823 --> 00:37:36.174
Oh, I'm, uh...

610
00:37:36.217 --> 00:37:37.827
I'm-
- I'm-
- Well...

611
00:37:37.871 --> 00:37:41.353
I'm not-- I mean,
I am a straight guy.


612
00:37:41.396 --> 00:37:43.050
I didn't know if you were
serious or not.


613
00:37:43.093 --> 00:37:45.183
Joe's walking across the country
to raise awareness


614
00:37:45.226 --> 00:37:48.447
about bullying,
because his son was bullied.


615
00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.231
Well, why didn't you
bring him?


616
00:37:50.275 --> 00:37:53.016
Especially if he's as cute
as you are.


617
00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.628
Is he as cute as you, Daddy?

618
00:37:58.283 --> 00:38:01.024
Um... my son is dead.

619
00:38:05.115 --> 00:38:06.291
Oh, my God.

620
00:38:06.334 --> 00:38:08.423
Oh, my God,
I had no idea.


621
00:38:08.467 --> 00:38:10.556
I'm-- I'm so sorry.
#It's all good. Really.


622
00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:12.601
Let me take my foot
out of my mouth.

00:38:13.994 --> 00:38:15.604
I had no idea.
- It's all good.


625
00:38:15.648 --> 00:38:17.519
No, it's-
- It's not.

626
00:38:17.563 --> 00:38:20.870
I really didn't know, and now
I've got to perform again.


627
00:38:20.914 --> 00:38:22.829
Hey, hey. I'm okay.
- I'm so sorry.


628
00:38:26.398 --> 00:38:29.270
Honey, I'm gonna grab you
another beer.

Hey, honey.

636
00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:53.414
You in Steamboat Springs?

637
00:40:53.458 --> 00:40:55.634
Oh, my GPS must be
working again.


638
00:40:57.331 --> 00:40:59.420
It's been a hell of a walk
through Colorado.


639
00:40:59.464 --> 00:41:02.641
You gotta call us, you know,

640
00:41:02.684 --> 00:41:04.773
when you're going through
all those storms.


641
00:41:04.817 --> 00:41:07.254
It's crazy.
- What, are you worried?


642
00:41:07.297 --> 00:41:09.212
Well, don't be.
That storm went way south of me.


643
00:41:09.256 --> 00:41:10.736
I only caught
the tail end of it.


644
00:41:10.779 --> 00:41:14.043
Yeah, well,
still just call us.


645
00:41:14.087 --> 00:41:16.089
Okay. Hey, hold on a second.

646
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:19.919
#Hey, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.


647
00:41:19.962 --> 00:41:21.877
See you got

648
00:41:21.921 --> 00:41:23.357
How's the man of the house?

649
00:41:23.401 --> 00:41:25.315
Good. You know we're good.

650
00:41:25.359 --> 00:41:27.492
Wrestling practice
is really good.


651
00:41:27.535 --> 00:41:30.408
Coach filmed a few of them.
- Well, I can't wait to see them.


652
00:41:30.451 --> 00:41:32.671
Yeah, hey, Dad,

653
00:41:32.714 --> 00:41:36.370
what would you think about me
and Mom coming to visit you?


654
00:41:36.414 --> 00:41:38.546
Out on the road.
I mean, not on the road,


655
00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:42.637
but maybe in a motel
or a hotel, even?


656
00:41:42.681 --> 00:41:45.466
Well, I can't think of anything
I'd like better.


657
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.468
Your mom okay with it?

658
00:41:47.512 --> 00:41:49.688
Mom? Yeah.
She's okay with it.


659
00:41:49.731 --> 00:41:50.993
All right.

660
00:41:51.037 --> 00:41:52.691
Let me talk to your mom.

661
00:41:52.734 --> 00:41:53.909
Oh, shit.

662
00:41:59.349 --> 00:42:01.221
Okay, give me the phone back.

663
00:42:01.264 --> 00:42:02.831
You coming to see me?

664
00:42:02.875 --> 00:42:04.659
All right, yeah,
we'll talk about it.


665
00:42:04.703 --> 00:42:07.619
All right. Hurry.

666
00:42:07.662 --> 00:42:09.229
All right. Love you, bye.

667
00:42:15.714 --> 00:42:17.629
Oh, shit.

668
00:42:22.111 --> 00:42:23.722
Well, it's starting to snow.

669
00:42:23.765 --> 00:42:25.680
Maybe we could, uh,

670
00:42:25.724 --> 00:42:27.203
get out and do some
snowboarding later.


671
00:42:27.247 --> 00:42:28.422
There he is.

672
00:42:32.774 --> 00:42:34.689
Hey, hey!JOSEPH: #Hey, Dad.

673
00:42:34.733 --> 00:42:36.865
My God, son,
it's only been a few months.


674
00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:38.476
You're as tall as me
Missed you, buddy.


675
00:42:38.519 --> 00:42:40.216
I missed you too, Dad.
- Hey.


676
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.436
Hi. Saw you spit
that dip out.


677
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.307
Oh, no,
that's just for walking.


678
00:42:44.351 --> 00:42:46.440
Mm-hmm.
- You smell so good.


679
00:42:47.876 --> 00:42:50.009
How are you doing?
#So I, uh...


680
00:42:50.052 --> 00:42:52.490
I brought my wrestling tapes.
- Good. We'll watch them tonight.


681
00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:54.535
I've booked us a surprise
adventure for the afternoon.


682
00:42:54.579 --> 00:42:56.145
We have 15 minutes.
#Oh, all right.


683
00:42:56.189 --> 00:42:57.799
Is it snowboarding?
#No, no, no.


684
00:42:57.843 --> 00:43:00.193
You're gonna love it, I promise.
All right?


685
00:43:00.236 --> 00:43:01.760
All right, I got this.
- How was the drive?


686
00:43:01.803 --> 00:43:03.109
#Not bad.
- Oh, good.


687

Sir, it is a pleasure
to meet you.


704
00:44:20.142 --> 00:44:22.014
Dad's a celebrity.
#This is my wife.


705
00:44:22.057 --> 00:44:24.756
So nice to meet you.

706
00:44:24.799 --> 00:44:27.367
Hi, I'm...
- I'm his wife.


707
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.934
And Jadin's mom.
#Nice to meet you.


708
00:44:28.977 --> 00:44:31.371
And this is our son, Joseph.
- Hi, I'm Joseph.


709
00:44:31.414 --> 00:44:33.721
#Hi, Joseph.
#I think it's incredible


710
00:44:33.765 --> 00:44:36.332
what you're doing for your son.
#Yes.


711
00:44:36.376 --> 00:44:38.639
Takes real courage to stick up
for what you believe in.


712
00:44:38.683 --> 00:44:40.815
Well, it's got to be done.
This can't go on.


713
00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:42.600
#Yes.
#Would you mind


714
00:44:42.643 --> 00:44:44.558
if we got our picture with you?

715
00:44:44.602 --> 00:44:47.692
Sure. Absolutely.
#Yes. Thank you.


716
00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:49.258
Honey, take the picture.

717
00:44:49.302 --> 00:44:51.260
Oh. Okay.

718
00:44:51.304 --> 00:44:52.653
#Thank you.
#Thank you.


719
00:44:56.831 --> 00:44:59.007
#That's real good work.
#I'm getting faster.


720
00:44:59.051 --> 00:45:00.748
You see how much leverage
you got on him?


721
00:45:00.792 --> 00:45:02.010
He ain't going nowhere.

722
00:45:02.054 --> 00:45:03.969
That's good.

723
00:45:04.012 --> 00:45:05.579
That's real good.

724
00:45:08.016 --> 00:45:11.019
You seen this?
- Yeah.


725
00:45:11.063 --> 00:45:12.412
I was there when it happened.

726
00:45:12.455 --> 00:45:13.892
He's got some pretty decent
takedowns,


727
00:45:13.935 --> 00:45:15.589
but these transitions
are a lot more fluid.


728
00:45:15.633 --> 00:45:16.851
What's coach saying?

729
00:45:16.895 --> 00:45:18.505
Coach is saying
I'm doing good.


730
00:45:18.548 --> 00:45:20.289
You know, he's...
- Well, I'm seeing right here.


731
00:45:20.333 --> 00:45:22.944
We've been working out,
but he says I might want


732
00:45:22.988 --> 00:45:24.729
to look into losing
a few pounds.


733
00:45:24.772 --> 00:45:27.645
What? This boy's just growing.
No, no, no, no, no.


734
00:45:27.688 --> 00:45:30.386
You go up a couple pounds.
Go up another weight class.


735
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.345
#Brush your teeth.
- Tell the coach what I said.


736
00:45:32.388 --> 00:45:33.738
All right.
- Make sure you tell coach.


737
00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:35.261
We got an early morning
tomorrow, okay?


738
00:45:35.304 --> 00:45:36.741
Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.


739
00:45:36.784 --> 00:45:38.699
'Hey, hey, hey.'

740
00:45:38.743 --> 00:45:41.354
Get him to bed
so I can get you to bed.


741
00:45:41.397 --> 00:45:43.095
I'm trying.
You wanna help me?


742
00:45:43.138 --> 00:45:44.966
I'm just...

743
00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:46.838
I can't believe how much
he's improved.


744
00:45:46.881 --> 00:45:48.056
I know. Isn't it great?

745
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.235
I found this.

746
00:45:53.279 --> 00:45:55.107
I thought you might like
to see it.


747
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:56.456
What's that?

748
00:45:56.499 --> 00:45:58.153
Uh, well...

749
00:45:58.197 --> 00:45:59.372
Let me see.

750
00:46:13.299 --> 00:46:14.517
Where'd this come from?

751
00:46:14.561 --> 00:46:16.955
It was on his grave,
in some flowers.


752
00:46:16.998 --> 00:46:18.783
One of them little shits
that bullied my boy


753
00:46:18.826 --> 00:46:21.002
into the ground had the nerve
to stand over his grave?


754
00:46:21.046 --> 00:46:23.048
Well, Joe-
-Why?

755
00:46:23.091 --> 00:46:25.137
And now he wants
to apologize?


756
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.921
Who's this for?

757
00:46:26.965 --> 00:46:28.836
It's not for Jadin,
because he's dead and buried.


758
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.098
And not for me.

759
00:46:30.142 --> 00:46:31.752
What am I supposed to do
with this, Lola?


760
00:46:31.796 --> 00:46:33.711
I don't know I thought
you'd like to see it, Joe.


761
00:46:33.754 --> 00:46:35.974
I shouldn't have brought it.
- No, don't keep secrets from me.


762
00:46:36.017 --> 00:46:37.889
Don't even threaten that.
- I'm not keeping secrets.


763
00:46:37.932 --> 00:46:39.804
I'm out here on my own,
no money, alone, all right?


764
00:46:39.847 --> 00:46:42.458
No, the truth is all I have.
Shit!


765
00:46:42.502 --> 00:46:44.504
Well...
- That little son of a bitch.


766
00:46:44.547 --> 00:46:48.290
...you're... you're on a walk
for forgiveness, right?


767
00:46:48.334 --> 00:46:49.770
For...

768
00:46:49.814 --> 00:46:51.816
There's no apologies
with me, okay?


769
00:46:51.859 --> 00:46:54.514
There is no forgiveness here.
They buried that with my boy.


770
00:46:54.557 --> 00:46:56.472
Do you understand that, Lola?

771
00:46:58.213 --> 00:46:59.649
I should not have
brought that letter.


772
00:46:59.693 --> 00:47:01.651
Lola... what?

773
00:47:01.695 --> 00:47:04.089
It's all yours, Dad.
#Those sons of bitches.


774
00:47:04.132 --> 00:47:05.917
Fucking kidding me.
#Don't worry about it.


775
00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.745
Don't think about it then, Joe.

776
00:47:09.442 --> 00:47:13.011
Son of a bitch, Joseph,
get your ass in here now!


777
00:47:13.054 --> 00:47:15.404
Did you hear what the fuck
I said? Now!


778
00:47:15.448 --> 00:47:17.493
You see what you've done? Look!

779
00:47:17.537 --> 00:47:19.234
How many times
have I told you, huh?


780
00:47:19.278 --> 00:47:21.280
How many times to put the seat
up when you take a piss?


781
00:47:21.323 --> 00:47:23.108
#Joe!A hundred? A thousand?

782
00:47:23.151 --> 00:47:25.066
Nobody's fucking talking to you.
Shut the fuck up.


783
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.546
What do you think,
I'm your maid?


784
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:27.852
Hey! Just stop!

785
00:47:40.821 --> 00:47:42.649
Jesus Christ.

786
00:48:07.892 --> 00:48:09.458
Hey.

787
00:48:09.502 --> 00:48:12.505
What I saw in those practice
films was damn good, son.


788
00:48:12.548 --> 00:48:15.551
You keep it up, you'll be state
champ by the time I get back.


789
00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:19.294
I love you.

790
00:48:21.688 --> 00:48:22.820
Did you hear me?

791
00:48:28.042 --> 00:48:31.263
Yeah. Take care, Dad.

792
00:48:32.525 --> 00:48:33.700
And what else?

793
00:48:36.921 --> 00:48:38.357
I love you too.

794
00:48:43.275 --> 00:48:44.885
Hey.
- Hey.


795
00:48:44.929 --> 00:48:46.800
So I'll see you in Illinois,
or maybe even before.


796
00:48:48.497 --> 00:48:49.672
Yeah. We'll see.

797
00:48:51.326 --> 00:48:53.415
Well, I thought that was
the plan, Lola.


798
00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:56.723
We talked about this.
Lola, don't--


799
00:48:56.766 --> 00:48:59.160
Joe, don't you. Don't.

800
00:49:02.685 --> 00:49:04.296
What are you doing
out here?


801
00:49:04.339 --> 00:49:06.646
Because we've supported you
every step of the way,


802
00:49:06.689 --> 00:49:08.909
because we know
what's right for you.


803
00:49:08.953 --> 00:49:11.781
But you're supposed to be
on some forgiveness walk?


804
00:49:11.825 --> 00:49:14.393
And you act the way
you acted last night.


805
00:49:18.745 --> 00:49:22.488
Our son is gone, Joe.
Gone.


806
00:49:25.752 --> 00:49:28.407
You're gonna lose
another one,


807
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.626
because we're not gonna
sit around waiting


808
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.932
for another one
of your outbursts.


809
00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:33.194
Lola-
-It's not gonna happen.

810
00:49:33.238 --> 00:49:34.804
Lola, I-
-No, no, no, no, no.

811
00:49:34.848 --> 00:49:38.373
Keep walking. Keep walking.
Don't come home.


812
00:49:38.417 --> 00:49:42.812
Okay? Don't come home till you
figure out whatever it is


813
00:49:42.856 --> 00:49:44.205
that you need
to figure out.


814
00:49:44.249 --> 00:49:46.338
But I hope that's not
you being some


815
00:49:46.381 --> 00:49:49.297
Facebook celebrity and getting
your pictures taken with people.


816
00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.041
Are you walking
for Jadin, Joe?


817
00:49:55.695 --> 00:49:57.566
Because if you're walking
for Jadin,


818
00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.917
then you let Jadin let you know
when it's time to come home.


819
00:50:02.963 --> 00:50:04.573
I love you, Lola.

820
00:50:08.447 --> 00:50:11.058
You guys drive safe, okay?
I love you.


821
00:50:11.102 --> 00:50:13.278
Be safe.

822
00:50:17.456 --> 00:50:20.328
Be careful, all right?

Hello?
#Hey.


843
00:52:46.909 --> 00:52:48.781
Hey.

844
00:52:48.824 --> 00:52:52.785
So I found something,

845
00:52:52.828 --> 00:52:55.222
and I want you
to hear it, okay?


846
00:52:55.266 --> 00:52:58.007
I found it in his backpack,

847
00:52:58.051 --> 00:52:59.835
and I wanted to-
-Well, what is it?

848
00:52:59.879 --> 00:53:01.359
Can you read it to me?

849
00:53:01.402 --> 00:53:03.012
Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh...

850
00:53:04.405 --> 00:53:07.974
it's an essay
that he wrote.


851
00:53:11.847 --> 00:53:13.327
'It's a horrible thing
to be surrounded


852
00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:16.156
'by people who hate you

853
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.767
'when they don't even know you,

00:53:18.811 --> 00:53:20.769
'for a reason you can't change.

855
00:53:22.336 --> 00:53:24.860
'One they can't comprehend
or understand.


856
00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:28.212
'This is the life I live.

857
00:53:30.518 --> 00:53:32.172

I look for the pieces


858
00:53:32.216 --> 00:53:33.434
'I've dropped along the way.

859
00:53:35.915 --> 00:53:38.613

I cry myself to sleep

00:53:38.657 --> 00:53:41.007

869
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.644
'I don't know what I'm gonna do
if I don't.


870
00:54:09.688 --> 00:54:14.606
'It's only getting worse.
I just want it to be over.


871
00:54:14.649 --> 00:54:17.174
It will be soon enough.'

872
00:54:18.653 --> 00:54:20.220
Don't fucking look at us, fag.

873
00:54:23.745 --> 00:54:26.444
What are you doing in here?
Girl's bathroom's over there.


874
00:54:26.487 --> 00:54:29.098
Come hang out with us.

875
00:54:29.142 --> 00:54:31.623
What the fuck did we say
about looking at us?


876
00:54:31.666 --> 00:54:33.842
All he wants to do
is watch us change.


877
00:54:33.886 --> 00:54:37.194
He's shaking,
he wants it so bad.


878
00:54:37.237 --> 00:54:39.892
#Look at him shake.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.


879
00:54:39.935 --> 00:54:43.243
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.


880
00:54:43.287 --> 00:54:46.203
Let me ask you something.

881
00:54:46.246 --> 00:54:48.988
You like dick?

882
00:54:49.031 --> 00:54:50.468
Huh? Answer me.

883
00:54:50.511 --> 00:54:53.906
#I think he does.
- You like fucking dicks.


884
00:54:53.949 --> 00:54:55.212
I'll give you dick.

885
00:54:58.127 --> 00:54:59.346
Stop, stop.

886
00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:01.566
It's okay, it's okay.

887
00:55:03.611 --> 00:55:06.048
Fuck it.
You like fucking dick?


888
00:55:06.092 --> 00:55:08.616
Fucking dick?
You like fucking dick!


889
00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:15.754
You like that?
You like that? Huh?


890
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:23.457
Can we even give you
the names of the boys?


891
00:55:23.501 --> 00:55:25.633
No, no, no, no. No names.

892
00:55:27.809 --> 00:55:29.246
Have you considered
changing schools?


893
00:55:31.944 --> 00:55:33.946
Yeah. We applied
to another high school.


894
00:55:33.989 --> 00:55:36.035
We were out of their district,
so they rejected him.


895
00:55:38.124 --> 00:55:40.300
What about therapy?

896
00:55:40.344 --> 00:55:45.349
We did, um, a few sessions
of, uh, family therapy.


897
00:55:45.392 --> 00:55:47.481
And I don't need therapy.
They do.


898
00:55:47.525 --> 00:55:50.832
Jadin, I hear
what you're saying.


899
00:55:52.356 --> 00:55:53.705
You don't think
the situation


900
00:55:53.748 --> 00:55:55.141
might settle itself down
on its own?


901
00:55:55.184 --> 00:55:56.316
No, I don't.

902
00:55:59.014 --> 00:56:00.668
Okay.

903
00:56:00.712 --> 00:56:02.322
Mr. and Mrs. Bell,

904
00:56:02.366 --> 00:56:04.933
I'm not saying it was
acceptable behavior


905
00:56:04.977 --> 00:56:07.501
on the part of the other
students, because it wasn't,


906
00:56:07.545 --> 00:56:09.590
but we live in
a very small town,


907
00:56:09.634 --> 00:56:10.939
and the high school
student body


908
00:56:10.983 --> 00:56:14.029
is a reflection
of our community.


909
00:56:14.073 --> 00:56:16.597
If you file a formal complaint
against these boys,


910
00:56:16.641 --> 00:56:19.513
it may very well cause you more
trouble in the long run


911
00:56:19.557 --> 00:56:20.732
than it's worth.

912
00:56:23.996 --> 00:56:25.432
You don't know
what it's like...


913
00:56:27.739 --> 00:56:29.044
to feel like...

914
00:56:34.485 --> 00:56:36.748
you have to muster up
the courage to ask for help,


915
00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:39.316
and then only to find out
that the person who can


916
00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:41.056
just couldn't be bothered.

917
00:56:42.231 --> 00:56:46.192
Son, I am trying
to help you.


918
00:56:46.235 --> 00:56:49.021
I'm trying to stop you
from making a mistake.


919
00:57:40.768 --> 00:57:42.640
#Hey, it's Marcie.

920
00:57:44.468 --> 00:57:45.947
Hi, Marcie, it's me.

921
00:57:45.991 --> 00:57:47.949
Can you please call me
when you get the chance.


922
00:57:47.993 --> 00:57:50.691
I just need to talk to you.
Please call me when you can.


923
00:58:03.225 --> 00:58:05.097
Remember when we used to take...

924
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.620
Oh, just a second.

925
00:58:06.664 --> 00:58:08.796
Sorry.

926
00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.015
Jadin?

927
00:58:12.452 --> 00:58:15.194
Hi, it's me.
Can you talk for a second?


928
00:58:15.237 --> 00:58:17.196
Jadin? Hi, it's Dolores.

929
00:58:17.239 --> 00:58:19.111
Sorry. We're in the car.

930
00:58:19.154 --> 00:58:21.287
Hi, Mrs. Roberts.
I didn't know it was you.


931
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:23.985
I'm taking Colleen
to go see her cousin


932
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:25.683
over in Pendleton
for the weekend.


933
00:58:29.338 --> 00:58:32.907
Okay. Do you think you could
stop by and pick me up?


934
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:35.910
We are already out of Le Grande.

935
00:58:35.954 --> 00:58:37.390
So I'm sorry.

936
00:58:37.434 --> 00:58:38.957
But why don't you go

937
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.350
to our house and relax?

938
00:58:41.394 --> 00:58:43.265
Be alone for a little while.

939
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:45.746
I can't be alone right now,
okay?


940
00:58:45.790 --> 00:58:47.966
And I can't go home.

941
00:58:48.009 --> 00:58:49.837
So I need you to please
just come pick me up.


942
00:58:49.881 --> 00:58:51.491
Mom?

943
00:58:51.535 --> 00:58:52.710
No.

944
00:58:55.234 --> 00:58:57.845
Can it wait until Monday?

945
00:58:57.889 --> 00:59:01.240
We'll be back on Sunday night,
and we'll see you on Monday.


946
00:59:01.283 --> 00:59:03.460
And whatever it is,

947
00:59:03.503 --> 00:59:05.636
I'm sure that we can
take care of it then.


948
00:59:05.679 --> 00:59:09.204
Listen, Jadin, I will call you
first thing Sunday


949
00:59:09.248 --> 00:59:10.815
when we get back, okay?

950
00:59:10.858 --> 00:59:13.165
Just--

951
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:21.189
Come on, Jadin.

952
01:00:21.233 --> 01:00:23.670
Come on, Jadin!

953
01:00:23.714 --> 01:00:25.846
Come on, Jadin!

954
01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:30.068
No, no, no.

955
01:00:30.111 --> 01:00:32.549
Come on, come on, come on.

956
01:01:08.367 --> 01:01:10.499
Would you mind if I say grace?

957
01:01:10.543 --> 01:01:12.589
#Sure.
#It's okay?


958
01:01:12.632 --> 01:01:14.547
#No. Go ahead.
- It's okay?


959
01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:24.252
Our Father,
who art in heaven.


960
01:01:24.296 --> 01:01:27.081
We come before thee
with heavy hearts.


961
01:01:28.648 --> 01:01:31.564
We ask that thy loving
kindness be upon us.


962
01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:32.870
And thy guidance.

963
01:01:32.913 --> 01:01:34.393
We are indeed thankful
for the gift


964
01:01:34.436 --> 01:01:36.482
Jadin has been in our lives.

965
01:01:36.525 --> 01:01:39.398
We'll need help
on this new path.


966
01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:41.487
We are thankful
for this meal before us


967
01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:43.924
and ask thy blessing upon it.

968
01:01:43.968 --> 01:01:45.665
In Jesus' name, Amen.

969
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.016
Thank you.

970
01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:14.781
You gotta get out of this room,
Joe.


971
01:02:21.745 --> 01:02:23.616
You're pale as milk.

972
01:02:28.752 --> 01:02:33.844
Put some clothes on.
Go outside. Take a walk.


973
01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:38.152
Pretty sure
it'll do you good.


974
01:02:51.688 --> 01:02:53.646
Joe, I'm hurting too.

975
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.469
What are you doing?

976
01:03:36.515 --> 01:03:38.386
Just going for a drive.

977
01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:42.913
Go back inside, Joseph.

978
01:03:45.742 --> 01:03:49.484
No. Not until you tell me
what's going on.


979
01:03:53.924 --> 01:03:55.534
Get your ass
back in the house.


980
01:03:57.014 --> 01:03:58.537
I need to go for a drive,

981
01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.757
and you need to get back inside
and get into bed.


982
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.932
Now.

983
01:04:35.922 --> 01:04:37.532
Go back inside, Joseph.

984
01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:41.928
Now.

985
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:48.255
#Shit.

986
01:05:52.216 --> 01:05:53.652
Here you go.

987
01:05:53.695 --> 01:05:55.001
#Thanks, Mom.
#Thanks.


988
01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:58.526
Eat it while it's hot.

989
01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:00.093
Can you pass me the syrup?

990
01:06:00.137 --> 01:06:01.399
Yes.
#I have some bacon too.


991
01:06:01.442 --> 01:06:03.836
#It may seem...

992
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.533
...people are just
going after each other,


993
01:06:05.577 --> 01:06:08.101
but it requires a lot of skill.

994
01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:10.930
Whoa! You're up.

995
01:06:10.974 --> 01:06:12.714
Hi.

996
01:06:14.064 --> 01:06:15.500
Lola, I got something
to tell you.


997
01:06:15.543 --> 01:06:17.632
#Okay.
- Could you give me a few minutes?


998
01:06:17.676 --> 01:06:20.113
Yes, Joe.

999
01:06:20.157 --> 01:06:22.115
What is it?

1000
01:06:22.159 --> 01:06:26.728
I've decided to walk
across America to New York City.


1001
01:06:28.252 --> 01:06:29.470
What?

1002
01:06:29.514 --> 01:06:30.907
Did you hear what I said?

1003
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:32.125
Yeah.

1004
01:06:32.169 --> 01:06:33.387
When did you decide that?

1005
01:06:33.431 --> 01:06:35.085
Well, just earlier this morning.

1006
01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:38.262
When I told you to take a walk,
I meant around the block.


1007
01:06:38.305 --> 01:06:39.785
Not to New York City.
- Lola,


1008
01:06:39.828 --> 01:06:42.048
I'll talk to everybody
along the way.


1009
01:06:42.092 --> 01:06:44.529
Anybody who will listen.
About bullying.


1010
01:06:44.572 --> 01:06:46.966
About the damage it does.
About what it did to our boy.


1011
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:49.751
I'm doing this for Jadin, Lola.
It's what he wants.


1012
01:06:49.795 --> 01:06:51.797
It's what he'd want me to do,
I know it is.


1013
01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.496
I mean, he told us he wanted to
live there someday, remember?


1014
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:58.238
Yeah. Yeah.

1015
01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:00.762
Uh, I don't know.

1016
01:07:00.806 --> 01:07:03.461
How do you-- How do you--
How do you pay for it?


1017
01:07:03.504 --> 01:07:06.246
Well, I'll-- I'll get the money.
I can fundraise.


1018
01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.161
I mean, everybody's against
bullying, aren't they?


1019
01:07:08.205 --> 01:07:12.426
No. If they were,
this wouldn't have happened.


1020
01:07:15.473 --> 01:07:17.823
Let me get you something to eat
before you head on the highway.


1021
01:07:17.866 --> 01:07:19.999
So nice that you're
back up again.


1022
01:07:20.043 --> 01:07:21.696
Can I get some coffee, Marcie?
#Yeah.


1023
01:07:24.612 --> 01:07:26.919
Hey. You didn't tell your mama
about last night, did you?


1024
01:07:26.963 --> 01:07:28.399
No, sir.

1025
01:07:28.442 --> 01:07:31.097
Come here.
I love you, buddy.


1026
01:07:31.141 --> 01:07:32.664
Hey. I love you so much.

1027
01:07:32.707 --> 01:07:34.318
This is gonna be
something great, all right?


1028
01:07:34.361 --> 01:07:36.233
You'll see. I promise.
- Yeah.


1029
01:08:02.389 --> 01:08:03.608
Joe?

1030
01:08:05.914 --> 01:08:07.133
Joe?

1031
01:08:07.177 --> 01:08:08.352
Lola.

1032
01:08:11.703 --> 01:08:13.531
Joe, say something.
Why are you not talking?


1033
01:08:13.574 --> 01:08:15.272
You're scaring me.

1034
01:08:15.315 --> 01:08:18.275
I don't-- I don't think
I can keep going.


1035
01:08:18.318 --> 01:08:21.930
Joe... come on.

1036
01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:24.716
You gotta keep going.
- I just wanna come home.


1037
01:08:24.759 --> 01:08:27.762
Oh, Joe, you can't come home.
Come on.


1038
01:08:29.503 --> 01:08:31.636
You're doing it
for Jadin, remember?


1039
01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:35.074
Yeah. For Jadin.
I remember.


1040
01:08:35.118 --> 01:08:36.554
Yeah. And for us.

1041
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:40.036
Do you want to talk to Joseph?

1042
01:08:40.079 --> 01:08:41.994
Is he there? Yeah.

1043
01:08:42.038 --> 01:08:43.909
Yeah, he's getting ready
for his wrestling match.


1044
01:08:43.952 --> 01:08:45.519
We're late.

1045
01:08:45.563 --> 01:08:47.086
I know he'd love
to talk to you, though.


1046
01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:48.740
Not like this.

1047
01:08:48.783 --> 01:08:50.872
Just... just tell him...

1048
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.225
tell him I'll call--
I'll call him later.


1049
01:08:57.009 --> 01:08:58.967
Okay, okay. I'll tell him.

1050
01:09:01.144 --> 01:09:02.319
Lola?

1051
01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:06.758
I saw him.

1052
01:09:06.801 --> 01:09:08.368
He was right there
in front of me.


1053
01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:12.416
And he just kept leading me
for miles, and...


1054
01:09:14.157 --> 01:09:16.028
I followed him all the way,
and then...


1055
01:09:19.771 --> 01:09:21.251
he just disappeared.

1056
01:09:25.559 --> 01:09:26.995
Mom! We're late!

1057
01:09:28.519 --> 01:09:29.694
Joe.

1058
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:32.566
Mom, did you pack the shoes?

1059
01:09:32.610 --> 01:09:34.351
Yeah. Everything's in there.

1060
01:09:34.394 --> 01:09:37.005
Okay. All right.

1061
01:09:37.049 --> 01:09:38.181
I love you.

1062
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:40.705
I love you.

1063
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:57.678
Kindness. And respect.

1064
01:09:57.722 --> 01:10:00.028
Kindness is the most important
quality a human being can have,


1065
01:10:00.072 --> 01:10:01.813
or that a parent can have.

1066
01:10:01.856 --> 01:10:04.076
Shit, when I was walking and
talking these past six months,


1067
01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.209
you never know how long you have
the people that you love


1068
01:10:06.252 --> 01:10:07.906
and that love you,

1069
01:10:07.949 --> 01:10:10.996
so you damn well
better love now, all right?


1070
01:10:11.039 --> 01:10:12.824
No matter how confused
or misguided or messed up


1071
01:10:12.867 --> 01:10:14.173
you think they are.

1072
01:10:14.217 --> 01:10:15.740
Because it's probably
a good chance


1073
01:10:15.783 --> 01:10:17.568
that you're just as messed up
as they are.


1074
01:10:17.611 --> 01:10:20.179
You gotta look in the mirror,
and gotta have accountability.


1075
01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:21.354
All right?

1076
01:10:45.639 --> 01:10:47.902
Hey, there. You're Joe Bell?

1077
01:10:47.946 --> 01:10:49.208
That I am. Yes.

1078
01:10:49.252 --> 01:10:50.470
I've got something for you.

1079
01:10:52.168 --> 01:10:53.299
Oh!

1080
01:10:54.692 --> 01:10:55.954
Holy shit!

1081
01:10:57.956 --> 01:11:00.088
Come here!

1082
01:11:00.132 --> 01:11:01.786
So we got Coke in here,
and some ice.


1083
01:11:01.829 --> 01:11:03.701
We got water over here
in this one.


1084
01:11:03.744 --> 01:11:05.311
That's a solar panel.

1085
01:11:05.355 --> 01:11:08.184
We'll pay you for this.
You're a good man, Jim.


1086
01:11:08.227 --> 01:11:10.708
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1096
01:11:59.931 --> 01:12:01.498
Yeah, I...

1097
01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:03.282
You know, last night,
I had a corral


1098
01:12:03.326 --> 01:12:05.763
a bunch of strangers up the
street to come and hear me talk.


1099
01:12:05.806 --> 01:12:09.070
Shit. I gotta go.

1100
01:12:09.114 --> 01:12:11.682
Time for me to explain myself
to another lawman.


1101
01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.475
Howdy, sir.

1102
01:12:22.519 --> 01:12:24.216
Hi.

1103
01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.305
While you're taking your hands
out of your pockets,


1104
01:12:26.349 --> 01:12:28.612
why don't you tell me
where you're headed.


1105
01:12:28.655 --> 01:12:30.222
New York City.

1106
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:33.356
Looking for a ride
out here then?


1107
01:12:33.399 --> 01:12:34.879
No. I'm walking.

1108
01:12:34.922 --> 01:12:36.576
Walking all the way to New York?

1109
01:12:38.578 --> 01:12:40.319
Joe Bell.

1110
01:12:40.363 --> 01:12:41.842
Yeah.

1111
01:12:41.886 --> 01:12:43.496
Well, what's your mission,
Mr. Bell?


1112
01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.498
Well, like it says there
on my card,


1113
01:12:45.542 --> 01:12:47.152
I talk to people
about bullying.


1114
01:12:47.195 --> 01:12:48.806
About how it's not okay
to torment somebody


1115
01:12:48.849 --> 01:12:50.286
because they're different
from you.


1116
01:12:50.329 --> 01:12:51.722
Different how?

1117
01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:55.856
Like my son Jadin.
He was gay.


1118
01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.119
He was bullied so bad in school,
he couldn't take it anymore.


1119
01:13:02.036 --> 01:13:03.516
You been on the road
six months?


1120
01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:04.778
Yeah.

1121
01:13:04.822 --> 01:13:06.911
I started out
in La Grande, Oregon.


1122
01:13:10.218 --> 01:13:12.351
When was the last time
you had a warm meal?


1123
01:13:17.356 --> 01:13:20.577
Sam, meet my new friend,
Joe Bell.


1124
01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.883
Joe, Sam.

1125
01:13:22.927 --> 01:13:26.322
Sam's my girl of all work,
and our dispatcher.


1126
01:13:26.365 --> 01:13:27.801
Have a seat.

1127
01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:30.761
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

1128
01:13:30.804 --> 01:13:32.328
It's a pleasure, Joe.

1129
01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:35.287
I called the chaplain
like you asked, Sheriff.


1130
01:13:35.331 --> 01:13:37.028
He says once you give him
the green light,


1131
01:13:37.071 --> 01:13:39.073
he'll announce a youth meeting
with Joe as the speaker


1132
01:13:39.117 --> 01:13:41.162
here at the high school
this afternoon.


1133
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:43.643
Joe?

1134
01:13:43.687 --> 01:13:45.079
Yeah, as long as you're sure

1135
01:13:45.123 --> 01:13:46.733
you can drop me off
where you picked me up,


1136
01:13:46.777 --> 01:13:48.779
because I intend to walk every
single step of the way.


1137
01:13:48.822 --> 01:13:49.997
Then let's get you fed.

1138
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:56.613
Lunch here is usually
last night's leftovers.


1139
01:13:56.656 --> 01:13:58.484
I'm a sorry cook,
but I've learned the basics


1140
01:13:58.528 --> 01:13:59.703
of a microwave.

1141
01:14:03.576 --> 01:14:06.318
That's my son, William.

1142
01:14:08.625 --> 01:14:11.410
He wasn't your typical
teenage boy.


1143
01:14:11.454 --> 01:14:13.760
He didn't have that
'girl crazy' attitude


1144
01:14:13.804 --> 01:14:15.849
that we had when we
were his age.


1145
01:14:19.853 --> 01:14:22.378
Janine's pinto beans are even
better the next day.


1146
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:23.727
Hmm. Yeah.

1147
01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:25.424
And the day after that.

1148
01:14:25.468 --> 01:14:27.252
I haven't had beans this good
since I left home.


1149
01:14:28.688 --> 01:14:30.734
The stove is strictly
Janine's domain.


1150
01:14:30.777 --> 01:14:32.823
I barely know
how to boil water.


1151
01:14:32.866 --> 01:14:34.041
She's a keeper.

1152
01:14:37.436 --> 01:14:41.571
I was on the family computer
one day, and I...


1153
01:14:41.614 --> 01:14:43.094
I saw that Will
had been searching


1154
01:14:43.137 --> 01:14:44.661
what it meant to be gay.

1155
01:14:53.931 --> 01:14:56.107
I have to admit, at first, I...

1156
01:14:58.065 --> 01:15:01.329
I worried that I'd been
too tough on him growing up.


1157
01:15:01.373 --> 01:15:03.331
We were raised Christians,
after all.


1158
01:15:05.943 --> 01:15:08.380
I wondered if he might have
told me sooner himself


1159
01:15:08.424 --> 01:15:12.471
if I hadn't been
such a hard-core lawman.


1160
01:15:12.515 --> 01:15:15.605
I thought about
that same thing.


1161
01:15:15.648 --> 01:15:18.085
About whether I was
too hard on my boy.


1162
01:15:18.129 --> 01:15:20.958
Well, if Jadin knew
before he died


1163
01:15:21.001 --> 01:15:25.136
that you loved him
and accepted him, that's what...


1164
01:15:25.179 --> 01:15:27.617
that's what matters,
isn't it?


1165
01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.357
I want to believe
that that's the way it was,


1166
01:15:29.401 --> 01:15:32.839
but I don't know if it was.

1167
01:15:36.539 --> 01:15:38.889
When I broke the news
to my dad


1168
01:15:38.932 --> 01:15:42.066
that his oldest grandson
was gay, he surprised me.


1169
01:15:42.109 --> 01:15:44.285
He's a Marine.

1170
01:15:44.329 --> 01:15:46.244
And he was a lot more
accepting


1171
01:15:46.287 --> 01:15:48.289
of William being gay
than I was.


1172
01:15:51.423 --> 01:15:54.078
And that made me take a long,
hard look at myself.


1173
01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.866
My father
didn't understand.


1174
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:02.260
Still doesn't to this day,
even with Jadin being gone.


1175
01:16:04.262 --> 01:16:06.830
You know a lot of folks believe
that being gay is a choice?


1176
01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.876
All things being equal,

1177
01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.139
Jadin would have never
chosen to be bullied.


1178
01:16:12.183 --> 01:16:13.576
With all things being equal,

1179
01:16:13.619 --> 01:16:15.752
he would have never chosen
the way he died.


1180
01:16:17.841 --> 01:16:19.016
You know, Ben...

1181
01:16:20.887 --> 01:16:22.454
when I started out walking...

1182
01:16:24.064 --> 01:16:26.414
I didn't know
what I was doing, really.


1183
01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:29.983
I thought I just wanted
to make Jadin's life...


1184
01:16:31.855 --> 01:16:33.900
and his death
matter somehow.


1185
01:16:37.077 --> 01:16:38.252
But what I come to know...

1186
01:16:40.298 --> 01:16:41.995
is I've been walking
and trying to figure out


1187
01:16:42.039 --> 01:16:43.693
why my son did what he did.

1188
01:16:47.261 --> 01:16:49.176
And make sense out
of the part that I played


1189
01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.874
in his decision
to end his life.


1190
01:16:53.616 --> 01:16:56.575
I mean, I was too caught up
in my own feelings


1191
01:16:56.619 --> 01:16:58.011
about what other people
would think


1192
01:16:58.055 --> 01:17:00.840
to see how alone
my own son must have felt.


1193
01:17:00.884 --> 01:17:03.060
I should've known how bad
it was for him.


1194
01:17:03.103 --> 01:17:05.541
I... I should've known
all along.


1195
01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:06.846
But instead I just...

1196
01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:13.679
I just made Jadin's being gay
all about Joe Bell.


1197
01:17:15.594 --> 01:17:16.726
About me.

1198
01:17:18.075 --> 01:17:19.293
Not about my boy.

1199
01:17:27.258 --> 01:17:28.433
Joe...

1200
01:17:31.654 --> 01:17:34.352
I think you made me
realize something.


1201
01:17:38.617 --> 01:17:41.098
It never crossed my mind until
this very moment that...


1202
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:46.407
William might have considered
taking his own life.


1203
01:17:53.676 --> 01:17:56.287
I don't think I could've
carried on if he had.


1204
01:18:08.734 --> 01:18:10.475
I never let him know
it was okay.


1205
01:18:12.085 --> 01:18:13.521
And I gotta live with that.

1206
01:18:16.829 --> 01:18:19.136
Don't make that same mistake,
Ben.


1207
01:18:19.179 --> 01:18:21.268
Don't do that to your son
or yourself.


1208
01:19:24.984 --> 01:19:26.159
Um...

1209
01:19:30.773 --> 01:19:31.904
Shh!

1210
01:19:35.516 --> 01:19:37.257
Uh...

1211
01:19:37.301 --> 01:19:39.085
thanks for having me
here today.


1212
01:19:39.129 --> 01:19:41.740
Uh, my name is Joe Bell.

1213
01:19:41.784 --> 01:19:44.787
I'm really honored to be here
to speak with you today


1214
01:19:44.830 --> 01:19:47.137
about something that I feel
is very, very important


1215
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:50.009
not only to myself,
but to all of you.


1216
01:20:38.579 --> 01:20:40.364
I think you and I
are a lot more alike


1217
01:20:40.407 --> 01:20:42.279
than you'd want
to admit, Dad.


1218
01:20:47.414 --> 01:20:52.115
It took me 13 years

1219
01:20:52.158 --> 01:20:57.903
to realize that living a lie
wasn't really living at all.


1220
01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:00.863
It only took you six months.

1221
01:21:02.081 --> 01:21:03.256
No, son.

1222
01:21:05.868 --> 01:21:08.261
It took me 45 years
and six months.


1223
01:21:09.959 --> 01:21:11.525
I'm sorry, Jadin.

1224
01:21:11.569 --> 01:21:13.179
I'm so sorry.

1225
01:21:20.665 --> 01:21:23.973
I never meant for you to feel
that I didn't love you.


1226
01:21:26.758 --> 01:21:28.151
No, son. I never felt that.

1227
01:21:31.328 --> 01:21:32.895
And I always knew
you loved me.


1228
01:21:35.158 --> 01:21:36.376
Everything just...

1229
01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:39.249
hurt so much.

1230
01:21:42.818 --> 01:21:44.907
But deep down,
I always knew.


1231
01:21:47.648 --> 01:21:49.172
That means the world to me,
son.


1232
01:21:50.956 --> 01:21:52.566
The whole breathing world.

1233
01:22:13.979 --> 01:22:15.154
Dad?

1234
01:22:20.203 --> 01:22:21.378
I love you.

1235
01:22:25.338 --> 01:22:27.471
I know. I know.

1236
01:22:33.042 --> 01:22:34.260
I love you, buddy.

1237
01:22:45.358 --> 01:22:47.926
Hey, Lola, honey. It's me.

1238
01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:50.798
The reason I'm calling is
to tell you that I love you.


1239
01:22:50.842 --> 01:22:51.974
You and Joseph.

1240
01:22:54.977 --> 01:22:57.544
Thanks for putting up with me
all these years.


1241
01:22:57.588 --> 01:22:59.198
I don't know what would've
happened to me


1242
01:22:59.242 --> 01:23:00.852
if you hadn't come along
and taken me in.


1243
01:23:00.896 --> 01:23:03.594
I'm just truly lucky
to have my family.


1244
01:23:06.031 --> 01:23:08.512
There's a lot of things
I've learned out here,


1245
01:23:08.555 --> 01:23:10.296
with nobody but me for company.

1246
01:23:11.994 --> 01:23:13.560
Some of it's been hard
to come to know.


1247
01:23:15.258 --> 01:23:17.521
Real hard.

1248
01:23:17.564 --> 01:23:19.784
I know I've still got
a long road ahead of me.


1249
01:23:19.827 --> 01:23:21.917
And I'll be better about
staying in touch from now on.


1250
01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.092
You'll see.

1251
01:23:24.484 --> 01:23:26.399
You give my love to our boy.

1252
