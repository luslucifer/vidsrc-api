1
00:00:19.223 --> 00:00:22.715
See that private school
education paid off.


2
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.580
It's called a political conscience, ed.

3
00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:25.604
You wouldn't understand.

4
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.890
Called vandalism.

5
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.459
You know, it'll be people like you first

6
00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:29.877
against the wall when
the revolution comes.


7
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:31.311
People like us, you mean.

8
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:34.853
Working class
is a state of mind.


9
00:00:35.156 --> 00:00:36.896
Tell that to the working class.

10
00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:39.470
You know, this type of
anti-social behavior


11
00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:41.234
is text book acting out.

12
00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:42.537
Do you need hug?

13
00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:44.915
Get off.

14
00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.490
Why can't you take me seriously?

15
00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:50.160
I do just not very.

16
00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:54.963
You've got that face.

17
00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.612
You know I don't like it
when you get that face.


18
00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:58.376
You stop that face right now Dylan.

19
00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.544
Oh, grow a pair, you
great steaming Nancy.


20
00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:02.054
Dylan, that wasn't a dare.

21
00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.720
Dylan, stop, Dylan.

22
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.930
Stop Dylan.

23
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.187
Absolutely do not do that Dylan whiteman.

24
00:01:10.483 --> 00:01:11.543
How are we gonna smash the state

25
00:01:11.567 --> 00:01:13.273
if you always do what
they tell you, Eddie.


26
00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:15.184
Dylan, this is gonna be three strikes.

27
00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:16.603
Three strikes.

28
00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:18.442
Viva la revolution.

29
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.460
Dylan.

30
00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:34.464
Crap my life.

31
00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:36.964

rules zed Alpha.

64
00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:10.910
You stand accused of
rebellion against the laws


65
00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:12.205
of the galaxy,

66
00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.787
and I find you guilty, guilty.

67
00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:18.622
Guilty.

68
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:20.502
We recognize no law.

69
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.042
We follow where chaos leads us.

70
00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:27.710
Your kind are pestilence

71
00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:30.380
spreading death and
destruction across the stars.


72
00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:33.428
For the benefit of sane
life forms everywhere,


73
00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:37.095
you will be executed,

74
00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:41.482
and your metal reduced
to inanimate sludge.


75
00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:45.232
Disintegrate her.

76
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:10.086
Chaos provides.

77
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.350
Maximum power restore.

78
00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:47.191
Do you wanna go to jail?

79
00:06:48.237 --> 00:06:49.852
Cant be worse than boarding school.

80
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:54.197
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it can.

81
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.221
I'm just making a statement.

82
00:06:56.245 --> 00:06:58.531
You know, driving my point home.

83
00:06:58.831 --> 00:06:59.831
What point?

84
00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:00.449
You have no point,

85
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:02.580
you are, in fact, completely pointless.

86
00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:05.584
Maybe my point is there is no point.

87
00:07:07.631 --> 00:07:09.872
You're such an attention seeker.

88
00:07:10.176 --> 00:07:12.212
Here's Dylan choking on a cigar,

89
00:07:12.511 --> 00:07:13.751
waving her flame thrower around

90
00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:15.004
and then you act all surprised

91
00:07:15.181 --> 00:07:16.181
that everything's on,

92
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:19.347
you act all surprised
everything's on fire.


93
00:07:19.643 --> 00:07:21.474
It's just how I express.

94
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.761
It's not my fault
we get oppressed for it.

95
00:07:24.064 --> 00:07:26.055
1s this who you wanna
be when you grow up?


96
00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:28.276
Dick head.

97
00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:30.643
Ow.

98
00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:32.402
Anarchists, eh?

99
00:07:32.698 --> 00:07:34.529
Hey, I'm Rick.

100
00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:35.359
I'm in a band.

101
00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:36.659
Oh, fuck off.

102
00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:38.609
Ignore rebel without a clue.

103
00:07:38.913 --> 00:07:39.447
She doesn't get enough affection.

104
00:07:39.747 --> 00:07:41.283
Oh, you can fuck off too.

105
00:07:41.582 --> 00:07:43.914
Wearing one of my t shirts.

106
00:07:45.085 --> 00:07:46.085
No, I'm not.

107
00:07:46.253 --> 00:07:47.493
I'm wearing one of my t shirts.

108
00:07:47.713 --> 00:07:49.328
One of my designs.

109
00:07:49.632 --> 00:07:50.632
I designed this one.

110
00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:54.167
Anarchy rules with a zed.

111
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.256
You did not design
the symbol for anarchy.


112
00:07:56.555 --> 00:07:57.995
He might have, how would you know?

113
00:07:58.224 --> 00:07:59.760
Oh, what has happened to your brain?

114
00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:03.413
Vandalism, resisting arrest,

115
00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:05.302
assaulting a police officer,

116
00:08:05.606 --> 00:08:07.417
now that's quite an
accomplishment for one night,


117
00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:08.772
even for you two.

118
00:08:09.068 --> 00:08:11.150
It's called freedom of expression, Sam..

119
00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:12.150
Shut up.

120
00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:13.151
Google it.

121
00:08:13.447 --> 00:08:13.981
Oh.

122
00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:15.281
Hey, man, sup?

123
00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:16.407
It's called felony,

124
00:08:16.534 --> 00:08:18.741
and it usually comes with jail time,

125
00:08:19.036 --> 00:08:20.276
but lucky for you too,

126
00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:22.490
all charges have been dropped

127
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.825
and you're free to go.

128
00:08:24.124 --> 00:08:25.204
Dropped, how?

129
00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:26.501
Stop talking.

130
00:08:26.627 --> 00:08:28.227
Just say thank you to the nice policeman

131
00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:29.494
for not putting us in jail.

132
00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:31.378
Please.

133
00:08:33.676 --> 00:08:35.257
Don't thank me.

134
00:08:38.597 --> 00:08:40.383
You're in a lot of trouble young lady.

135
00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:42.681
Crap my life.

136
00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:50.669
Put you in private schools

137
00:08:50.693 --> 00:08:52.729
and this is what they turn out,

138
00:08:53.028 --> 00:08:54.643
your mother would roll in her grave.

139
00:08:55.864 --> 00:08:57.024
She'd understand.

140
00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.030
She wasn't a fascist.

141
00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:03.903
I'm just gonna not be here.

142
00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:08.120
You're not a damn kid anymore, Dylan.

143
00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:09.619
It's time you started thinking

144
00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:12.335
about the consequences of your actions.

145
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:14.231
I'm running on a law and order platform,

146
00:09:14.258 --> 00:09:15.258
for Christ's sake.

147
00:09:18.262 --> 00:09:20.423
Sorry to be an embarrassment.

148
00:09:21.807 --> 00:09:22.867
The next time you screw up,

149
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:23.891
you're on your own.

150
00:09:28.105 --> 00:09:31.017
J sing sing after you sing 2

151

There's arent normal
nocturnal lights, velma.

00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:54.416
Genuine ufos, possibly containing genuine

00:09:54.715 --> 00:09:56.330
little green men.

155
00:10:06.226 --> 00:10:08.968

00:10:31.126 --> 00:10:32.707
What's eating you?

162
00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:42.130
Shit, that was close.

163
00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:50.096
Hey.

00:10:50.396 --> 00:10:52.387
Oh, bitch face

Haha ha.

166
00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:55.185
She's letting me work from home.

167
00:10:55.484 --> 00:10:58.066
Wow, she's getting soft.

168
00:10:58.362 --> 00:10:59.422
Must have got a root or something.

Help me.

172
00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:11.541
Whoa.

173
00:11:18.924 --> 00:11:20.835
You all right?

174
00:11:21.135 --> 00:11:22.215
Feed me.

175
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:23.511
She's hungry.

176
00:11:24.596 --> 00:11:26.461
I've only really been
eating from that side.


177
00:11:26.765 --> 00:11:28.380
Help me get her up.

178
00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:29.969
It's all right, we've got you.

179
00:11:38.402 --> 00:11:39.812

They're good, don't you think?

193
00:12:25.741 --> 00:12:27.447
Yeah, if you like piss way posers.

194
00:12:29.703 --> 00:12:30.863
Oh look, her comes Dixie now.

195
00:12:31.163 --> 00:12:31.868
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.


196
00:12:32.164 --> 00:12:34.280
My two favorite anarchists.

197
00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:36.223
All right, you made
it out of Scarlet 13.

198
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:36.994
Yes.

199
00:12:37.294 --> 00:12:38.294
Yeah.

200
00:12:38.462 --> 00:12:38.996
We know how to work the system.

201
00:12:39.296 --> 00:12:40.296
Yeah.

202
00:12:40.464 --> 00:12:41.169
- Anarchy.
- Yeah.


203
00:12:41.465 --> 00:12:44.047
Your sound was just so...

204
00:12:49.807 --> 00:12:50.967
Sonic.

205
00:12:51.266 --> 00:12:52.426
Thanks, babe.

206
00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:54.512
You got a favorite song?

207
00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:55.812
Yeah.

208
00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:57.538
You know that one about the puppy farms.

209
00:12:57.815 --> 00:13:01.524
Like puppy farming is
so wrong, am I right, d?


210
00:13:01.819 --> 00:13:03.150
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.


211
00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:04.464
Gotta love those puppies.

212
00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:05.507
There's one of those puppy farms

213
00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:06.611
just down the road.

214
00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:08.275
Yeah, yeah. 
- No.

215
00:13:08.575 --> 00:13:09.761
Oh my god, I didn't know that.

216
00:13:09.785 --> 00:13:10.785
It's terrible.

217
00:13:10.869 --> 00:13:12.789
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it
makes me so mad, you know,


218
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.412
I made at shirt especially.

219
00:13:15.707 --> 00:13:16.913
Wow.

220
00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:17.743
Yeah.

221
00:13:18.043 --> 00:13:19.203
Oh, gee, that'll learn 'em.

222
00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:21.543
Yeah, hey, that's just stage one,

223
00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:24.296
stage two is the raid.

224
00:13:24.591 --> 00:13:25.171
Raid?

225
00:13:25.467 --> 00:13:28.334
Done it before, free the puppies.

226
00:13:28.637 --> 00:13:29.922
- That sounds exciting.
- Yeah.


227
00:13:30.222 --> 00:13:30.756
Can we help?

228
00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:32.056
We.

229
00:13:32.307 --> 00:13:33.307
Shut up, Dylan.

230
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.910
Yeah, we'd do anything to help the poor

231
00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:36.387
little defenseless little puppies.

232
00:13:36.687 --> 00:13:37.847
Why do you keep saying we?

233
00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:39.541
Could be a little dangerous.

234
00:13:39.565 --> 00:13:40.099
That's okay.

235
00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.013
- I actually...
- You know?


236
00:13:41.316 --> 00:13:42.852
Know kung fu.

237
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:44.311
- Well.
- So.


238
00:13:45.362 --> 00:13:47.398
Hey, maybe we could
case the joint, you know,


239
00:13:47.698 --> 00:13:48.858
if you're keen?

240
00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:50.426
Oh, I'm keen all right.

241
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.032
Oh my god, she's keen for your cock.

242
00:13:53.328 --> 00:13:54.363
It's as plain as the face

243
00:13:54.663 --> 00:13:55.743
on a Bulgarian pin up.

244
00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.418
Could you just excuse
me just for one second?


245
00:14:02.713 --> 00:14:04.999
Oh, my boots.

246
00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:08.211
Can you pick us up from my place?

247
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:17.808
J you can't find me »

248
00:16:10.757 --> 00:16:12.338
Feed me, drown me.

249
00:16:39.828 --> 00:16:40.828
Chaos.

250
00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:44.915
Infinitum.

251
00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:07.473
Fucking senorita, you dumb cunt, god.

252
00:17:07.773 --> 00:17:08.773
Ugh, idiot.

253
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.891
Now, what's on the menu for today?

254
00:17:12.194 --> 00:17:14.731
Ah, abit of pebo, hit
'em high, hit 'em low,


255
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.145
hit 'em with your old pebo.

256
00:17:16.448 --> 00:17:17.779
Oh, no, wait, I know,

257
00:17:18.075 --> 00:17:19.906
how about a maybe she's born with it,

258
00:17:20.202 --> 00:17:22.318
maybe it's maybelline, yes.

259
00:17:55.529 --> 00:17:57.770
All righty, then, who's next?

260
00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:01.652
Chaos provides.

261
00:18:24.057 --> 00:18:26.799
You've been trying on
hats for like, 300 hours.


262
00:18:27.102 --> 00:18:28.942
How can it matter how
much what's on your head?


263
00:18:29.062 --> 00:18:32.930
It's called style, Dylan,
you wouldn't understand.


264
00:18:35.402 --> 00:18:37.734
You don't care what
happens at a puppy farm.


265
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:39.644
Probably don't even know, I bet.

266
00:18:39.948 --> 00:18:40.948
Yeah, I do know.

267
00:18:42.117 --> 00:18:44.358
It's where they grow all the puppies.

268
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.830
I'm joking.

269
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.201
I know allabout it, I
picked up this leaflet.


270
00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:52.501
Oh.

271
00:18:53.587 --> 00:18:56.795
Oh my god, Dylan, what is your problem?

272
00:18:58.175 --> 00:18:59.175
Alittle break and enter,

273
00:18:59.426 --> 00:19:01.291
damaging corporate property,

274
00:19:01.595 --> 00:19:03.756
rescuing poor little oppressed puppies,

275
00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:05.855
thought this would be
right up your flag pole.


276
00:19:06.016 --> 00:19:08.553
I'm the one that gets
us into trouble, not you.


277
00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:11.350
You're ruining my sense of self.

278
00:19:11.646 --> 00:19:15.264
You know, there are
other ways to get him

279
00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:17.211
to stick it in you a
wriggle it around abit.


280
00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:19.271
Oh, stop.

281
00:19:19.571 --> 00:19:20.902
Look, if you won't do it for me,

282
00:19:21.198 --> 00:19:23.029
will you do it for the puppies?

283
00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:35.121
Come on, let's free
these fucking puppies, now.


284
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:39.291
Ooh, how do I look?

285
00:19:39.591 --> 00:19:40.626
Like abitch in heat.

286
00:20:12.582 --> 00:20:14.994
This is bigger than roswell,

287
00:20:15.293 --> 00:20:18.501
this is bigger than roswell and
whistle and Brazil combined.


288
00:20:23.927 --> 00:20:25.838
Get a grip, velma.

289
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:31.256
Play your cards right,

290
00:20:32.894 --> 00:20:35.054
you'll be on the cover of
disclosure magazine for sure.


291
00:21:00.505 --> 00:21:02.041
This is the place.

292
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.580
We're here.

293
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:11.171
What is it?

294
00:21:11.474 --> 00:21:12.589
Lysergic acid.

295
00:21:14.894 --> 00:21:15.894
Better not.

296
00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:18.439
No?

297
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.016
I'm really good, thank you.

298
00:21:24.446 --> 00:21:25.856
Let's go.

299
00:21:51.556 --> 00:21:52.796
Down, down.

300
00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:54.368
The security guard's not at the front,

301
00:21:54.392 --> 00:21:55.792
that gives us exactly four minutes.

302
00:21:55.935 --> 00:21:57.330
If either of you see or hear anything,

303
00:21:57.354 --> 00:21:58.389
give me the signal.

304
00:21:58.688 --> 00:21:59.393
What signal?

305
00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:00.689
Ca caw.

306
00:22:01.274 --> 00:22:02.274
Ca caw?

307
00:22:05.528 --> 00:22:06.563
Let's go.

308
00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:14.696
Bolt cutters.

309
00:22:14.996 --> 00:22:15.530
1 cant even do my own laundry,

310
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.030
why would I have bolt cutters?

311
00:22:17.207 --> 00:22:18.822
I said come equipped.

312
00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:21.332
1 did, I brought this.

313
00:22:21.628 --> 00:22:24.119
We can't open that with this.

314
00:22:24.422 --> 00:22:25.753
Give me one of your hair pins.

315
00:22:27.509 --> 00:22:29.500
I don't have any.

316
00:22:36.601 --> 00:22:39.718
So what do we
do when we get inside?

317
00:22:41.231 --> 00:22:42.666
We find the evidence to close down

318
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:43.690
this torture factory.

319
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.390
I thought it was a puppy farm.

320
00:22:47.737 --> 00:22:49.102
Didnt you read my leaflet?

321
00:22:50.156 --> 00:22:51.441
I skimmed part of it.

322
00:22:51.741 --> 00:22:52.741
We're in.

323
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.635
Did anyone else hear that?

324
00:23:24.107 --> 00:23:25.627
You sure you know where we're going?

325
00:23:25.692 --> 00:23:27.102
I feel like we're definitely lost.

326
00:23:28.069 --> 00:23:29.525
Is that a map?

327
00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:32.938
Oh my god, thank
god, you brought a map.

328
00:23:35.952 --> 00:23:36.987
This isn't a map.

329
00:23:37.287 --> 00:23:39.949
It's ablueprint of a
romulan space vagina.


330
00:23:41.833 --> 00:23:42.833
What do we do now?

331
00:23:44.627 --> 00:23:45.627
Let's go over here.

332
00:24:08.234 --> 00:24:09.690
Oh.

333
00:24:09.986 --> 00:24:10.520
What?

334
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.860
Oh crap my life.

335
00:24:13.656 --> 00:24:15.271
- Oh.
- Oh my god.


336
00:24:15.575 --> 00:24:16.760
I thought you had done this before.

337
00:24:16.784 --> 00:24:17.864
I have, I have.

338
00:24:18.161 --> 00:24:18.695
What do you mean?

339
00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:20.360
1 just don't know, no, no.

340
00:24:20.663 --> 00:24:21.903
Get your shit together.

341
00:24:22.207 --> 00:24:22.912
Don't know what it's like...

342
00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:23.913
Ca caw.

343
00:24:24.209 --> 00:24:24.914
Not now Eddie.

344
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.210
No, I mean, ca caw.

345
00:24:31.966 --> 00:24:34.332
Look, lady, we don't want any trouble,

346
00:24:34.636 --> 00:24:37.469
but there's three of
us and only one of you.


347
00:24:37.764 --> 00:24:39.880
And I know kung fu.

348
00:24:40.183 --> 00:24:41.548
So we can do this the easy way

349
00:24:41.851 --> 00:24:42.851
or the hard way.

350
00:24:43.686 --> 00:24:44.801
Your call.

351
00:24:50.193 --> 00:24:51.193
The easy way.

352
00:25:15.343 --> 00:25:17.254
There's no reception.

353
00:25:35.863 --> 00:25:36.898
- Bomb.
- Yes.


354
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.555
Rick, do something.

355
00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:27.954
Oh, should have been more specific.

356
00:26:29.959 --> 00:26:31.165
Dylan.

357
00:26:46.267 --> 00:26:47.632
Fuck you.

358
00:26:53.775 --> 00:26:55.606
- What the hell?
- What?


359
00:27:05.495 --> 00:27:09.158
This is bullshit, why
won't you die, bitch?


360
00:27:10.124 --> 00:27:11.268
We've gotta get out of here.

361
00:27:11.292 --> 00:27:12.311
But what about the puppies?

362
00:27:12.335 --> 00:27:14.041
Fuck the puppies.

363
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:18.042
Wait, Dylan, Dylan.

364
00:27:18.341 --> 00:27:18.875
What?

365
00:27:19.175 --> 00:27:19.709
What about Rick?

366
00:27:20.009 --> 00:27:20.543
Screw that guy, he's on his own.

367
00:27:20.843 --> 00:27:21.423
No, you don't understand.

368
00:27:21.719 --> 00:27:22.719
He's got the car keys.

369
00:27:24.222 --> 00:27:25.428
Crap my life.

370
00:27:26.808 --> 00:27:27.808
All right, come on.

371
00:27:40.988 --> 00:27:42.273
So who's next?

372
00:27:44.409 --> 00:27:46.491
Eenie, meenie, minie, you.

373
00:27:55.795 --> 00:27:57.456
Taco, nachos.

374
00:27:57.755 --> 00:27:58.870
Oh crap.

375
00:28:17.108 --> 00:28:18.108
Ca caw.

376
00:28:38.504 --> 00:28:40.119
Are you eating a puppy?

377
00:28:40.423 --> 00:28:42.960
I was hungry, do you want some?

378
00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:45.259
You're eating chemicals
I've injected into those.


379
00:28:45.553 --> 00:28:47.589
They're not organic or
free range or nothing.


380
00:28:48.514 --> 00:28:49.514
Just ugh.

381
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:52.302
Yuck.

382
00:28:57.732 --> 00:28:59.142
Good luck.

383
00:29:35.561 --> 00:29:37.222
What the hell is she doing?

384
00:29:37.522 --> 00:29:38.853
I don't know.

385
00:29:39.148 --> 00:29:40.167
So long as whatever that is

386
00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:42.773
stays away from us, I don't care.

387
00:29:43.069 --> 00:29:44.229
Come on, let's go find prick.

388
00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:45.529
You mean Rick?

389
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.780
I know what I mean.

390
00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:50.360
Chicken shit could be anywhere.

391
00:29:52.578 --> 00:29:53.693
This place is creepy.

392
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.540
Ca caw.

393
00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.368
Ca caw.

394
00:30:03.464 --> 00:30:04.169
Are you high?

395
00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:05.124
I'm doing the plan.

396
00:30:05.424 --> 00:30:06.664
Is it aplan to get us killed?

397
00:30:06.843 --> 00:30:08.003
Do we look dead?

398
00:30:08.302 --> 00:30:08.882
I'm about this close to killing myself.

399
00:30:09.178 --> 00:30:11.058
Just because it was my
plan and not your plan.


400
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:11.885
We always have to do what Dylan says.

401
00:30:12.181 --> 00:30:13.450
You always have to be the leader.

402
00:30:13.474 --> 00:30:14.008
Why don't you stick to
something you're good at,


403
00:30:14.308 --> 00:30:15.423
ed, like matching colors.

404
00:30:15.726 --> 00:30:17.933
Ca caw.

405
00:30:18.229 --> 00:30:20.094
Ha.

406
00:30:20.398 --> 00:30:21.763
Don't be smug.

407
00:30:24.986 --> 00:30:27.068
Okay, then, come on, be quiet.

408
00:30:27.989 --> 00:30:28.989
Ca caw.

409
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.140
Would you please stop doing that?

410
00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:32.367
Ca caw.

411
00:30:32.577 --> 00:30:33.692
We've gotta do something.

412
00:30:34.787 --> 00:30:35.902
Ca caw.

413
00:30:36.205 --> 00:30:38.446
Like, I don't know, come
up with an escape plan


414
00:30:38.749 --> 00:30:40.239
or something practical like that.

415
00:30:40.543 --> 00:30:41.543
Genius.

416
00:30:42.837 --> 00:30:44.418
I am, thanks for noticing.

417
00:30:45.464 --> 00:30:46.608
You really think they're aliens?

418
00:30:46.632 --> 00:30:49.624
What do you think they're
gonna do, anal probe us?


419
00:30:51.429 --> 00:30:53.090
That's an interesting theory.

420
00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:57.225
No!

421
00:31:59.664 --> 00:32:00.664
Oh shit.

422
00:32:20.017 --> 00:32:21.017
You've got that face.

423
00:32:21.894 --> 00:32:24.094
You know, I don't like it
when you get that face, Dylan.


424
00:32:26.273 --> 00:32:27.479
Son of a bitch must pay.

425
00:32:29.777 --> 00:32:32.018
Dylan, that face always
gets us into trouble.


426
00:32:51.298 --> 00:32:52.879
That hit the spot.

427
00:33:04.395 --> 00:33:05.601
Excuse me.

428
00:33:06.564 --> 00:33:07.791
I'd like to distract you for a second.

429
00:33:07.815 --> 00:33:08.474
From what?

430
00:33:08.774 --> 00:33:09.774
From me.

431
00:33:12.778 --> 00:33:13.778
Get off.

432
00:33:15.322 --> 00:33:16.687
Hey, it worked.

433
00:33:18.284 --> 00:33:19.284
Piece of piss.

434
00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:21.805
Yeah, you know, there's
always a simple trick


435
00:33:21.829 --> 00:33:22.363
with these things,

436
00:33:22.663 --> 00:33:23.243
and once you know it it's like...

437
00:33:23.539 --> 00:33:24.995
Ca caw.

438
00:33:25.291 --> 00:33:29.409
Ca caw.

439
00:33:31.255 --> 00:33:32.255
Ca caw.

440
00:33:33.299 --> 00:33:34.539
Yo, groomer bitch.

441
00:33:34.842 --> 00:33:36.298
Ca caw.

442
00:33:38.012 --> 00:33:39.798
Try picking on someone my size.

443
00:33:44.143 --> 00:33:46.509
Hi, I'm Dylan, this is Eddie.

444
00:33:46.812 --> 00:33:47.812
We're here to rescue you.

445
00:33:48.064 --> 00:33:48.598
Can we just focus?

446
00:33:48.898 --> 00:33:50.013
Let's get out of here.

447
00:33:50.316 --> 00:33:51.556
Yeah, we're getting to that.

448
00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:53.378
First we can do what
we came here to do,

449
00:33:53.402 --> 00:33:56.269
I'm gonna free the damn puppies.

450
00:34:17.176 --> 00:34:18.176
Oh, the mobile.

451
00:34:18.427 --> 00:34:21.544
Look, clearly this hunk of
junk isnt going anywhere.


452
00:34:21.847 --> 00:34:22.847
Come on, short round.

453
00:34:23.015 --> 00:34:24.471
Hold your smoking horses.

454
00:34:24.767 --> 00:34:26.473
I've gotta get the biological samples

455
00:34:26.769 --> 00:34:28.475
that are from the crash site.

456
00:34:28.771 --> 00:34:29.305
What crash site?

457
00:34:29.605 --> 00:34:31.124
No one said anything about a crash site.

458
00:34:31.148 --> 00:34:32.684
Listen carefully.

459
00:34:32.983 --> 00:34:36.316
This is a classic close
encounter of the seventh kind.


460
00:34:36.612 --> 00:34:37.732
Based on what I've observed,

461
00:34:37.947 --> 00:34:40.154
there's an extraterrestrial cyborg

462
00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:42.155
and it's casting mind controlling thrall

463
00:34:42.451 --> 00:34:43.451
over everyone.

464
00:34:43.661 --> 00:34:44.661
That's what I guess

465
00:34:44.912 --> 00:34:46.112
until I can analyze everything

466
00:34:46.288 --> 00:34:47.744
with my continuum flux capacitor.

467
00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:51.077
Are you off your meds?

468
00:34:52.211 --> 00:34:53.211
1 am.

469
00:34:54.755 --> 00:34:56.370
Yeah, I'd like to go, 
Dylan, thanks.

470
00:34:56.674 --> 00:34:59.086
Look, do whatever you need to do faster,

471
00:34:59.385 --> 00:35:00.750
eggplant, you're wasting time.

472
00:35:01.053 --> 00:35:02.133
You'll thank me later.

473
00:35:02.429 --> 00:35:03.885
This is exactly what we need

474
00:35:04.181 --> 00:35:06.217
to initiate first contact protocols

475
00:35:06.517 --> 00:35:09.429
with our intergalactic interloper.

476
00:35:09.728 --> 00:35:11.844
Hey, you know, calm your
tits, Princess delusions


477
00:35:12.148 --> 00:35:14.230
of grandeur, alien
interlopers not withstanding,


478
00:35:14.525 --> 00:35:15.919
we're not about to do anything right now

479
00:35:15.943 --> 00:35:17.479
except save our own collective asses.

480
00:35:17.778 --> 00:35:18.312
- Yes.
- You got that?


481
00:35:18.612 --> 00:35:19.271
- Yes.
- Now let's book.


482
00:35:19.572 --> 00:35:20.572
That means leave.

483
00:35:21.782 --> 00:35:24.364
- Oh shit.
- Robo bitch.


484
00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.660
Get them.

485
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:29.033
We still have your fucking glasses.

486
00:35:54.857 --> 00:35:56.722
Is everyone okay?

487
00:35:59.695 --> 00:36:01.185
Where's Rick?

488
00:36:01.488 --> 00:36:02.648
We'd better go get him.

489
00:36:02.948 --> 00:36:04.279
Oh, fuck that guy.

490
00:36:04.575 --> 00:36:05.906
He still has the keys.

491
00:36:06.202 --> 00:36:07.863
Seriously, fuck that guy.

492
00:36:16.629 --> 00:36:17.629
He waited.

493
00:36:19.423 --> 00:36:20.423
Eddie, no.

494
00:36:21.217 --> 00:36:22.217
Rick.

495
00:36:28.807 --> 00:36:30.092
Oh my god.

496
00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:38.313
How the fuck aren't you dead yet?

497
00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:37.166
Yeah, bitch.

498
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.416
Eddie, use this.

499
00:37:43.215 --> 00:37:44.751
Fuck yeah.

500
00:37:55.602 --> 00:37:57.968
How many times for
little worms, bitches.


501
00:37:58.272 --> 00:37:59.307
- Dylan.
- Hey.


502
00:38:23.672 --> 00:38:24.752
Eat this.

503
00:38:47.946 --> 00:38:50.312
Come on, smack heads.

504
00:38:53.827 --> 00:38:54.827
Eddie.

505
00:38:56.955 --> 00:38:58.195
Fuck you.

506
00:38:58.499 --> 00:38:59.955
We need more of that slime.

507
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.740
There is no more slime.

508
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.424
Yes.

509
00:39:15.724 --> 00:39:16.724
Yes.

510
00:39:17.726 --> 00:39:18.726
Bitch.

511
00:39:19.853 --> 00:39:22.765
Oh, what are you guys doing?

512
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240
Dylan!

513
00:39:37.538 --> 00:39:38.653
Crap, help me!

514
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:40.741
Oh help.

515
00:40:50.736 --> 00:40:51.896
Are we clear?

516
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.986
Yeah, we're clear.

517
00:40:55.282 --> 00:40:56.613
Where are we gonna go?

518
00:40:56.909 --> 00:40:58.274
We can't go to the police.

519
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:01.402
They think I'm a crazy person.

520
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.370
Here.

521
00:41:04.666 --> 00:41:05.701
Want some?

522
00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:06.706
No.

523
00:41:07.002 --> 00:41:09.038
It's good for the thrall.

524
00:41:10.172 --> 00:41:11.787
Take us to city hall.

525
00:41:16.553 --> 00:41:17.759
Everyone out there seems to be

526
00:41:18.055 --> 00:41:21.547
under some sort of evil mind control.

527
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:22.555
- Mind control?
- No, no.


528
00:41:22.851 --> 00:41:24.842
That's alien thrall.

529
00:41:25.145 --> 00:41:27.261
Possibly alien thrall, whatever,

530
00:41:27.564 --> 00:41:30.681
and they're all wearing
these cybernetic plugs


531
00:41:30.984 --> 00:41:32.224
in their eyes,

532
00:41:32.528 --> 00:41:34.564
and this Mexican guy killed Rick

533
00:41:34.863 --> 00:41:36.399
with a whipper snipper and...

534
00:41:36.698 --> 00:41:37.698
With a whipper snipper.

535
00:41:37.741 --> 00:41:38.230
But then we found this green slime.

536
00:41:38.534 --> 00:41:41.992
No, no, that's the alien secretions.

537
00:41:42.287 --> 00:41:42.821
- The secretions.
- Yes.


538
00:41:43.121 --> 00:41:44.349
The green slime. 
And, there was,

539
00:41:44.373 --> 00:41:46.238
that's non-cybernetic.
Yes, ah ha.


540
00:41:46.542 --> 00:41:48.203
Green alien slime,

541
00:41:48.502 --> 00:41:50.083
and it pretty much just melted him.

542
00:41:50.379 --> 00:41:50.868
Ugh, it was like...

543
00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:52.411
The wicked witch in the west.

544
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:53.078
Just like, just got on them

545
00:41:53.382 --> 00:41:54.542
and it was like.

546
00:41:58.512 --> 00:41:59.512
Anyway.

547
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.591
We're in big trouble.

548
00:42:04.184 --> 00:42:05.890
And we really...

549
00:42:10.774 --> 00:42:13.641
I really need your help.

550
00:42:15.904 --> 00:42:16.904
Please.

551
00:42:22.452 --> 00:42:23.452
Dad.

552
00:42:29.501 --> 00:42:30.991
Get her out of my sight.

553
00:42:32.671 --> 00:42:33.671
- What, hold on.
- What?


554
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.200
- Wait aminute.
- We've got proof.


555
00:42:35.257 --> 00:42:36.568
- Oh my god.
- What are you doing?


556
00:42:36.592 --> 00:42:37.172
- The spaceships.
- The slime.


557
00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:40.550
Dad, this is way more important
than your stupid election.


558
00:42:40.846 --> 00:42:41.505
They're probably
going tokill us all.


559
00:42:41.805 --> 00:42:43.157
- Do you realize?
- The aliens are here.


560
00:42:43.181 --> 00:42:44.181
- Excuse me.
- The aliens.


561
00:42:44.266 --> 00:42:45.786
- Help me.
- They're gonna kill us all.


562
00:42:50.314 --> 00:42:50.973
You don't think I'm
gonna throw the book at you


563
00:42:51.273 --> 00:42:52.638
this time?

564
00:42:52.941 --> 00:42:54.226
Dad won't let that happen.

565
00:42:55.902 --> 00:42:57.938
You haven't heard his new slogan?

566
00:42:58.238 --> 00:43:01.730
Well, turns out that no
one is above the law,


567
00:43:02.743 --> 00:43:05.200
and believe it or not,
that includes family.


568
00:43:14.796 --> 00:43:16.707
Guess you cant fight city hall,

569
00:43:17.007 --> 00:43:19.043
even if your dad is the mayor.

570
00:43:24.556 --> 00:43:25.996
Has anyone from the animal shelter

571
00:43:26.266 --> 00:43:28.131
called to report abreak in or anything?

572
00:43:40.197 --> 00:43:42.037
Have you got in contact
with this Rick guy yet?


573
00:43:47.788 --> 00:43:50.746
Just see if he's got any
friends around town, would you?


574
00:43:54.378 --> 00:43:55.378
Hello.

575
00:43:57.339 --> 00:43:59.079
Oh, for fuck's sake.

576
00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:01.486
We have to find a way of communicating

577
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.169
with the alien.

578
00:44:02.469 --> 00:44:03.675
It's obviously intelligent.

579
00:44:04.596 --> 00:44:06.632
We need to be
able to reason with it.

580
00:44:08.183 --> 00:44:10.970
Well, we're locked up.

581
00:44:11.269 --> 00:44:12.509
The little eggplant's right.

582
00:44:12.813 --> 00:44:14.519
We need to bust qurselves out of here

583
00:44:14.815 --> 00:44:15.895
and save the world.

584
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:17.806
We are it.

585
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.476
Are you stupid?

586
00:44:20.779 --> 00:44:22.419
Maybe you haven't been paying attention

587
00:44:22.698 --> 00:44:24.063
to current events, but we kicked

588
00:44:24.366 --> 00:44:26.072
some pretty serious butt back there.

589
00:44:26.368 --> 00:44:27.368
Yeah, you know what?

590
00:44:27.619 --> 00:44:28.739
And we're lucky to be alive.

591
00:44:28.912 --> 00:44:29.446
This isn't a game.

592
00:44:29.746 --> 00:44:30.932
I know it's not a game, Dylan.

593
00:44:30.956 --> 00:44:31.956
People are dead,

594
00:44:32.749 --> 00:44:33.869
and more people are gonnadie

595
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.490
if we don't do something about it.

596
00:44:37.421 --> 00:44:41.130
What do I care if some
fucking rich old men


597
00:44:41.425 --> 00:44:43.711
get killed by acyborg alien?

598
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.625
Why should I care about that?

599
00:44:45.929 --> 00:44:49.296
Jesus Christ, when are
you ever gonna grow up?


600
00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:50.258
Fuck you.

601
00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:51.559
Fuck you, Dylan.

602
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:53.204
You think you're special
just because your mom died


603
00:44:53.228 --> 00:44:54.843
and your dad doesn't love you anymore.

604
00:44:55.147 --> 00:44:56.887
That's not even unusual.

605
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.226
Boo fucking hoo for you.

606
00:45:03.029 --> 00:45:05.691
Fuck, Eddie, I'm sorry.

607
00:45:05.991 --> 00:45:06.991
It's fine.

608
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:07.859
I just got angry.

609
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.554
- It's fine, just...
- I'm sorry, Eddie.


610
00:45:09.578 --> 00:45:10.578
Just leave me alone.

611
00:45:10.662 --> 00:45:11.697
Are you okay?

612
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:15.750
Fuck no.

613
00:45:19.755 --> 00:45:20.414
Now we're cool.

614
00:45:20.714 --> 00:45:21.749
We're cool right, yeah?

615
00:45:22.048 --> 00:45:23.538
We're totally fine, you fucking fine.

616
00:45:25.218 --> 00:45:26.218
Fuck.

617
00:45:28.472 --> 00:45:29.472
- Okay.
- Okay?


618
00:45:30.223 --> 00:45:31.223
Okay.

619
00:45:32.142 --> 00:45:33.142
Okay.

620
00:45:34.102 --> 00:45:37.060
Okay.

621
00:45:37.355 --> 00:45:37.889
Just because you put more a's in there

622
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:39.771
doesn't make it a threat.

623
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:45.102
Hat's coming off, bitch.

624
00:46:10.388 --> 00:46:12.049
Time out, time out.

625
00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:16.425
Joke.

626
00:46:19.689 --> 00:46:21.145
Ow.

627
00:46:24.152 --> 00:46:24.686
Have you had enough yet?

628
00:46:24.986 --> 00:46:26.567
Yes, I've had enough.

629
00:46:32.244 --> 00:46:33.279
Eddie.

630
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.665
God, get off me.

631
00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:49.969
Ow!

632
00:46:53.348 --> 00:46:54.428
Fuck.

633
00:47:26.631 --> 00:47:28.337
Nice of Rick to show up.

634
00:47:28.633 --> 00:47:30.464
Singers don't rock up to sound check.

635
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.795
Sound check's easy.

636
00:47:32.095 --> 00:47:33.460
He'll probably be laid up

637
00:47:33.763 --> 00:47:35.970
with some random girl
full of dope and beer,


638
00:47:36.266 --> 00:47:37.597
dead to the world.

639
00:47:37.893 --> 00:47:39.161
You got that part right.

640
00:47:39.185 --> 00:47:40.516
Which part?

641
00:47:40.812 --> 00:47:42.848
That part about him being dead.

642
00:47:43.148 --> 00:47:44.638
- Rick's dead.
- Mm hmm.


643
00:47:44.941 --> 00:47:46.021
It was so sad.

644
00:47:46.318 --> 00:47:47.318
I cried.

645
00:47:48.528 --> 00:47:49.528
Now...

646
00:47:50.906 --> 00:47:52.146
Who's first?

647
00:47:52.449 --> 00:47:54.155
Eenie meenie minie you.

648
00:47:58.163 --> 00:48:01.872
So we were talking about
escaping and saving the planet?


649
00:48:02.167 --> 00:48:03.167
Aliens.

650
00:48:03.335 --> 00:48:06.372
Plans like a sound to me.

651
00:48:07.923 --> 00:48:09.504
Does anyone have any hair pins?

652
00:48:10.508 --> 00:48:11.708
No, we've been through this,

653
00:48:11.843 --> 00:48:13.379
don't have any hair pins.

654
00:48:14.846 --> 00:48:16.882
Oh.

655
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.600
That?

656
00:48:19.684 --> 00:48:21.265
That's the shit.

657
00:48:21.561 --> 00:48:22.830
Since when did everyone just start

658
00:48:22.854 --> 00:48:23.559
carrying around hair pins?

659
00:48:23.855 --> 00:48:25.436
This is not a thing.

660
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.356
What are you doing?

661
00:48:32.656 --> 00:48:33.856
I'm probing.

662
00:48:33.949 --> 00:48:35.860
Yeah, I can see that.

663
00:48:36.159 --> 00:48:37.490
I mean, why?

664
00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:39.472
For information.

665
00:48:39.496 --> 00:48:40.827
From his butt hole?

666
00:48:41.122 --> 00:48:43.113
From his brain, you retard.

667
00:48:45.502 --> 00:48:46.992
Oh.

668
00:48:54.177 --> 00:48:58.011
No one can be above
the law, not even family.


669
00:48:59.808 --> 00:49:01.673
Oh, her.

670
00:49:01.977 --> 00:49:05.561
So what, you're just gonna go around?

671
00:49:05.855 --> 00:49:08.187
Take her face off.

672
00:49:08.483 --> 00:49:10.223
Take her face off.

673
00:49:10.527 --> 00:49:12.188
Yeah, face off.

674
00:49:12.487 --> 00:49:13.647
Take her face off?

675
00:49:13.947 --> 00:49:16.108
The face is coming.

676
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.691
It's just Lois.

677
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:59.197
One good dash for it and
we're out the front door.


678
00:49:59.492 --> 00:50:01.357
Bit of zig, bit of zag, home free.

679
00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:02.275
We still have to get the data

680
00:50:02.579 --> 00:50:04.820
that I collected from the crash site.

681
00:50:05.123 --> 00:50:05.828
There's no way.

682
00:50:06.124 --> 00:50:08.160
It's gonna be locked up
in evidence somewhere.


683
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.203
That data is our only
hope of saving the world.


684
00:50:13.548 --> 00:50:14.879
Important, right?

685
00:50:15.175 --> 00:50:16.210
We can wing it.

686
00:50:16.509 --> 00:50:18.795
1 don't think one of
your cigar and flamethrower


687
00:50:19.095 --> 00:50:20.655
purchases is gonna cut it this time, d.

688
00:50:20.764 --> 00:50:22.345
We need a proper strategy.

689
00:50:29.064 --> 00:50:30.474
No, I didn't mean I had one.

690
00:50:30.774 --> 00:50:32.139
1 just meant that we needed one.

691
00:50:33.735 --> 00:50:34.895
Ow.

692
00:50:35.195 --> 00:50:35.854
Excellent.

693
00:50:36.154 --> 00:50:37.154
Good work.

694
00:50:39.574 --> 00:50:41.254
Okay, so if I'm reading the map correctly,

695
00:50:41.284 --> 00:50:43.240
the evidence lock up is
just behind this door,


696
00:50:43.536 --> 00:50:44.889
so we're gonna get in, grab the stuff,

697
00:50:44.913 --> 00:50:46.369
and then get back out again.

698
00:50:46.664 --> 00:50:48.620
Okay, got it, follow the leader.

699
00:50:48.917 --> 00:50:51.203
One, two, three.

700
00:50:57.592 --> 00:50:58.798
We may be trapped.

701
00:51:01.012 --> 00:51:03.219
You girls go hide, 
I'll draw them out.

702
00:51:03.515 --> 00:51:04.595
I'll meet you at the front.

703
00:51:04.766 --> 00:51:05.766
Go!

704
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.846
Come on, you great steaming Nancy's.

705
00:51:13.149 --> 00:51:14.480
Viva la revolution.

706
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:30.701
Your friend certainly is brave.

707
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:31.534
What good's that gonna do her

708
00:51:31.835 --> 00:51:32.835
if she herself killed?

709
00:51:37.423 --> 00:51:38.663
This is it, found it.

710
00:51:39.509 --> 00:51:40.999
Come on.

711
00:51:43.638 --> 00:51:44.638
Wait, what? 
- This way.

712
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:45.931
- Just...
- Oh.


713
00:51:52.856 --> 00:51:53.856
Piece of piss.

714
00:52:09.873 --> 00:52:12.364
Knock knock.

715
00:52:12.667 --> 00:52:13.873
What, fuck it?

716
00:52:14.169 --> 00:52:14.703
You're wrecking it.

717
00:52:15.003 --> 00:52:16.709
You're supposed to say who's there,

718
00:52:17.005 --> 00:52:18.005
and I say...

719
00:52:20.508 --> 00:52:22.840
Your worst nightmare.

720
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:31.303
Shh.

721
00:52:31.603 --> 00:52:35.437
Then you say, "your worst nightmare who?"

722
00:52:36.983 --> 00:52:37.983
Yeah.

723
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:39.109
Okay.

724
00:52:39.903 --> 00:52:41.985
Your worst nightmare who?

725
00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.111
Your worst nightmare me.

726
00:52:53.166 --> 00:52:55.828
Oh wow, look, oh
my god, check it out.

727
00:52:56.127 --> 00:52:57.127
Look, whoo.

728
00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:01.292
Oh.

729
00:53:01.591 --> 00:53:02.831
Tough crowd.

730
00:53:03.134 --> 00:53:05.170
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

731
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.470
Oh.

732
00:53:09.098 --> 00:53:10.098
Oh, that's it, it, oh.

733
00:53:11.893 --> 00:53:12.893
What was that?

734
00:53:17.899 --> 00:53:19.099
I don't think it's anything.

735
00:53:20.193 --> 00:53:21.433
Come on, relax.

736
00:53:21.736 --> 00:53:22.736
It's nothing.

737
00:53:56.938 --> 00:53:58.724
Alpha c r delta.

738
00:53:59.023 --> 00:54:01.639
Alpha c r delta.

739
00:54:03.903 --> 00:54:05.859
Jesus fucking Christ.

740
00:54:11.452 --> 00:54:13.283
Whoa, freeze, don't move.

741
00:54:13.579 --> 00:54:16.491
Put the arm down and step
away from the bodies.


742
00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:17.791
You mean us?

743
00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:19.457
Both of you now.

744
00:54:20.503 --> 00:54:23.540
Dont move, don't come any closer.

745
00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.671
Dont come any closer.

746
00:54:33.558 --> 00:54:34.843
Look what you did.

747
00:54:35.143 --> 00:54:36.929
You just up and shot us.

748
00:54:37.228 --> 00:54:39.014
Dude, you need therapy.

749
00:54:53.244 --> 00:54:54.244
Ass.

750
00:54:54.495 --> 00:54:55.495
Jesus.

751
00:54:56.122 --> 00:54:57.122
Do you want some?

752
00:55:01.586 --> 00:55:03.247
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

753
00:55:03.546 --> 00:55:04.581
Oh.

754
00:55:14.766 --> 00:55:16.802
Will you two stop
playing with your food?


755
00:55:34.786 --> 00:55:35.445
Was that enough power for you

756
00:55:35.745 --> 00:55:37.345
'cause we've about sucked this place dry

757
00:55:37.413 --> 00:55:40.155
of everything that plugs
in or takes batteries.


758
00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:41.789
We shall see.

759
00:55:46.589 --> 00:55:47.589
Thank you, child.

760
00:55:59.685 --> 00:56:01.016
Probably Chinese.

761
00:56:01.312 --> 00:56:03.769
We require more power.

762
00:56:04.816 --> 00:56:06.335
Like I said, we're maxed out

763
00:56:06.359 --> 00:56:07.599
of electric gizmos here, boss.

764
00:56:09.028 --> 00:56:11.269
The transformation of
the old power station


765
00:56:11.572 --> 00:56:14.484
upgraded for more power.

766
00:56:14.784 --> 00:56:16.445
Chaos provides.

767
00:56:16.744 --> 00:56:18.735
Exactly what they've been asking for.

768
00:56:19.038 --> 00:56:21.950
Our commitment for you
as always is to make


769
00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:26.289
sure that your lives are
transformed to the better.


770
00:56:59.287 --> 00:57:00.287
Remember me?

771
00:57:10.965 --> 00:57:12.705
You may not recognize me

772
00:57:13.009 --> 00:57:14.749
because I used to have a face.

773
00:57:17.388 --> 00:57:18.388
I hope you understand

774
00:57:18.598 --> 00:57:19.798
we're gonna have to take yours

775
00:57:20.766 --> 00:57:21.766
as a replacement.

776
00:57:36.657 --> 00:57:37.191
What was that?

777
00:57:37.492 --> 00:57:40.154
That was like mildly
inconvenient at the worst.


778
00:57:47.835 --> 00:57:48.995
Okay, pass me that.

779
00:57:49.295 --> 00:57:50.876
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

780
00:57:51.172 --> 00:57:51.877
Drop it on my...

781
00:57:52.173 --> 00:57:53.533
- Careful with that.
- Geez, sorry.


782
00:57:53.716 --> 00:57:55.126
Anything were to happen

783
00:57:55.426 --> 00:57:57.041
to this stick, it would be bad.

784
00:57:57.345 --> 00:57:59.961
Like I said, luckily, nothing
actually happened to it.


785
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:03.070
Transport, transferred on six.

786
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:04.014
What's your message?

787
00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:05.015
Shit's bad.

788
00:58:05.311 --> 00:58:06.311
1425.

789
00:58:19.575 --> 00:58:21.281
You took my face off,

790
00:58:21.577 --> 00:58:24.444
I take your face off.

791
00:58:24.747 --> 00:58:26.032
It's not unreasonable.

792
00:58:35.925 --> 00:58:38.166
Did you throw a knife at my head?

793
00:58:38.469 --> 00:58:40.334
Fuck, I've head enough, going on.

794
00:58:51.482 --> 00:58:52.972
Come out, come out.

795
00:58:55.194 --> 00:58:56.194
Meet your face.

796
00:58:57.071 --> 00:58:59.904
First, I'm gonna peel your
face like citrus fruit,


797
00:59:00.199 --> 00:59:03.987
then I'm gonna cut off
your fingers, one by one,


798
00:59:04.287 --> 00:59:05.493
and stick them up your twat.

799
00:59:07.873 --> 00:59:10.580
Then I'm gonna anal probe
you till you're dead,


800
00:59:10.876 --> 00:59:12.236
and then if you're still not dead,

801
00:59:12.295 --> 00:59:12.909
I'll anal probe you again.

802
00:59:13.212 --> 00:59:14.952
That sounds like so much fun.

803
00:59:15.256 --> 00:59:16.256
Yep.

804
00:59:16.924 --> 00:59:18.204
You talk too much, little dog.

805
00:59:18.426 --> 00:59:19.426
I'll, what...

806
00:59:20.177 --> 00:59:22.884
Mess with the bulls,
you get the horns, bitch.


807
00:59:27.143 --> 00:59:28.474
Dylan, Dylan.

808
00:59:31.856 --> 00:59:32.856
Come here.

809
00:59:35.818 --> 00:59:36.853
What is he doing here?

810
00:59:37.153 --> 00:59:38.268
He believes us now.

811
00:59:38.571 --> 00:59:40.857
Yeah, I saw your cyborg
Minion things up close


812
00:59:41.157 --> 00:59:43.864
and personal so if
you're telling the truth,


813
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.775
or you know, also fucking crazy,

814
00:59:46.078 --> 00:59:47.222
but either way I reckon, you know,

815
00:59:47.246 --> 00:59:48.907
we should stick together.

816
00:59:49.206 --> 00:59:50.206
Did you get the stuff?

817
00:59:50.416 --> 00:59:51.416
Oh yeah.

818
00:59:53.002 --> 00:59:56.290
I can analyze this with my
quantum capacitor at home.


819
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:57.589
We should go there now.

820
00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.331
Well good, easy, we've
got a police escort now.


821
01:00:00.635 --> 01:00:01.635
Yep.

822
01:00:02.261 --> 01:00:03.501
You sit in the front, yeah.

823
01:00:13.147 --> 01:00:16.639
If that isn't enough power
for that ugly middle mole,


824
01:00:16.942 --> 01:00:17.942
I'll eat my left foot.

825
01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.948
Good citizens, it's true.

826
01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:29.701
I have solved all of
your worldly problems.


827
01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:31.404
I have the final solution

828
01:00:31.707 --> 01:00:32.867
and I'm gonna share it for...

829
01:00:34.377 --> 01:00:35.036
I'm gonna share.

830
01:00:35.336 --> 01:00:36.336
Crap my life.

831
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:37.921
What?

832
01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:40.086
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

833
01:00:40.383 --> 01:00:41.623
Get them!

834
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.466
- Go!
- Quick, quick, quick, go!


835
01:00:44.762 --> 01:00:45.762
Go!

836
01:00:58.609 --> 01:01:00.065
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

837
01:01:00.361 --> 01:01:01.521
- Brake!
- What are you doing?


838
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Oh my.

839
01:02:18.147 --> 01:02:21.389
J can you say how many
people might be annoyed j


840

- double trouble?
- Okay.


859
01:04:32.323 --> 01:04:33.563
Yeah.

860
01:04:34.825 --> 01:04:37.237
Dont get too cocky, the
effect is only temporary.


861
01:04:37.536 --> 01:04:38.536
How temporary?

862
01:04:38.787 --> 01:04:40.493
Extremely, let's go.

863
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:41.789
Yes.

864
01:04:45.336 --> 01:04:47.918
You're supposed to
be at home, young lady.


865
01:04:50.507 --> 01:04:51.507
Oh boy.

866
01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:56.676
Sounds right to me, come on.

867
01:04:58.515 --> 01:05:00.972
Kids, you give 'em a home,

868
01:05:01.268 --> 01:05:03.725
education, you give 'em opportunities

869
01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:07.309
with just a few simple rules to follow

870
01:05:07.608 --> 01:05:08.688
and what happens?

871
01:05:08.984 --> 01:05:11.475
They throw right back in your face.

872
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.451
They embarrass you at every turn

873
01:05:28.754 --> 01:05:31.666
and they cost you a goddamn fortune.

874
01:05:33.509 --> 01:05:34.919
You're the dumb ass who had me.

875
01:05:35.219 --> 01:05:38.256
The amount of self indulgent crapola

876
01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:40.136
I've had to copy my ear holes

877
01:05:40.432 --> 01:05:41.797
of your brat mouth.

878
01:05:43.394 --> 01:05:44.759
Well, it's payback time, Dylan.

879
01:05:45.062 --> 01:05:48.304
The rules have changed.

880
01:05:48.607 --> 01:05:50.222
You'll never embarrass me again.

881
01:05:51.986 --> 01:05:52.986
You're right.

882
01:05:53.779 --> 01:05:55.610
The rules have changed.

883
01:06:09.003 --> 01:06:10.834
That's my hat, bitch.

884
01:06:28.397 --> 01:06:29.397
Come on.

885
01:06:33.068 --> 01:06:37.027
Good citizens, I have
very exciting news,


886
01:06:37.322 --> 01:06:39.108
I, your beloved mayor,

887
01:06:39.408 --> 01:06:40.408
have personally solved

888
01:06:40.659 --> 01:06:43.025
all of your worldly concerns,

889
01:06:43.328 --> 01:06:44.328
I have yet.

890
01:06:45.205 --> 01:06:47.116
And I'm going to share it for free,

891
01:06:48.125 --> 01:06:50.741
so join me right now at city hall

892
01:06:51.045 --> 01:06:52.910
for the final solution

893
01:06:53.881 --> 01:06:54.881
to everything.

894
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:57.957
My doors are wide open.

895
01:06:59.136 --> 01:07:01.001
Starting a freaking production line.

896
01:07:02.014 --> 01:07:03.014
We're fucked.

897
01:07:03.265 --> 01:07:03.970
I can't get signal.

898
01:07:04.266 --> 01:07:06.803
We're officially on our own.

899
01:07:07.102 --> 01:07:07.636
Pretty used to that.

900
01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:09.472
Why aren't you wearing a shirt?

901
01:07:09.772 --> 01:07:11.512
That's not important.

902
01:07:11.815 --> 01:07:13.351
What is important is that we find

903
01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:15.390
these cyborg Minion thingies,

904
01:07:15.694 --> 01:07:17.605
and we eliminate them permanently.

905
01:07:17.905 --> 01:07:19.145
If not, we're fucked.

906
01:07:20.407 --> 01:07:22.568
Let's not very constructive, Eddie.

907
01:07:22.868 --> 01:07:24.233
You know, we can find you a shirt.

908
01:07:24.536 --> 01:07:29.200
That alien secretion
kills them permanently.


909
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:29.989
She's right.

910
01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:31.532
Turns 'em straight to ooze.

911
01:07:31.835 --> 01:07:33.035
It's totally their kryptonite.

912
01:07:33.295 --> 01:07:35.001
Hey, it's even green, want some?

913
01:07:36.215 --> 01:07:39.173
That sounds like our best option.

914
01:07:39.468 --> 01:07:40.468
Yeah.

915
01:07:40.719 --> 01:07:41.719
Let's roll with that.

916
01:07:41.887 --> 01:07:43.673
Only people wearing
shirts get a say, Sam.


917
01:07:43.972 --> 01:07:45.462
Oh my god, leave him alone.

918
01:07:45.766 --> 01:07:47.869
Yeah, I mean, if he doesn't
wanna wear a shirt then...


919
01:07:47.893 --> 01:07:50.726
He doesn't have to wear a shirt.

920
01:07:53.315 --> 01:07:55.075
You know, I think
we're getting sidetracked


921
01:07:55.234 --> 01:07:56.440
from the main issue.

922
01:07:56.735 --> 01:07:59.226
My vote goes in some
form of reckless violence.


923
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:01.566
We haven't even tried
communicating with it yet.


924
01:08:01.865 --> 01:08:03.985
You're a glass half full
kind of person, aren't you?


925
01:08:04.284 --> 01:08:05.740
Forget all that.

926
01:08:06.036 --> 01:08:07.555
We're gonna load up the car with supplies

927
01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:10.412
and we're gonna get out of
here while we still can.


928
01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:11.992
We'll had to Sandy or Sydney,

929
01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:13.686
and the Navy seals will take the case.

930
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:15.917
This is their kind of bag, not ours.

931
01:08:16.213 --> 01:08:17.933
We can't
abandon all these people.


932
01:08:18.048 --> 01:08:19.048
Why not?

933
01:08:19.216 --> 01:08:20.416
Could you live with yourself

934
01:08:20.592 --> 01:08:22.272
knowing you didn't even
try to save anyone?


935
01:08:22.344 --> 01:08:23.379
We did try,

936
01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:24.823
and that's more than any of them

937
01:08:24.847 --> 01:08:25.461
would do for us.

938
01:08:25.764 --> 01:08:26.344
Who says?

939
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.640
Life says.

940
01:08:27.933 --> 01:08:29.389
The world says, Eddie.

941
01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:31.016
You know, every man for himself.

942
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:31.925
Fuck all of that.

943
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:33.469
You and I look after each other

944
01:08:33.772 --> 01:08:35.262
like we always have.

945
01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:42.228
Maybe this is the end
that the world needs.


946
01:08:42.531 --> 01:08:44.692
Maybe it'll be better off
without any rich fucking


947
01:08:44.992 --> 01:08:45.992
white old men in change.

948
01:08:46.118 --> 01:08:47.699
God, not every old man out there

949
01:08:47.995 --> 01:08:49.235
is your dad, Dylan.

950
01:08:50.372 --> 01:08:55.036
This is their world, 
Eddie, not ours.

951
01:08:57.713 --> 01:08:59.419
Let the aliens take it.

952
01:08:59.715 --> 01:09:01.205
You can't mean that.

953
01:09:01.508 --> 01:09:02.508
Why not?

954
01:09:03.468 --> 01:09:04.821
There's no point in fighting any more.

955
01:09:04.845 --> 01:09:07.427
That's the only point.

956
01:09:07.723 --> 01:09:08.723
Shit happens.

957
01:09:08.974 --> 01:09:10.054
It's life, it's amess,

958
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:11.760
and it's out of control.

959
01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.641
It tries to hurt us and break us

960
01:09:13.937 --> 01:09:15.518
every single day,

961
01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:16.854
so you wanna hurt it back.

962
01:09:17.107 --> 01:09:17.641
I get it.

963
01:09:17.941 --> 01:09:20.057
Smash everything, let the world burn,

964
01:09:21.028 --> 01:09:22.268
but you can't.

965
01:09:24.698 --> 01:09:26.098
I get that you think that you don't

966
01:09:26.241 --> 01:09:27.356
have any other choice,

967
01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:29.320
but you do.

968
01:09:30.746 --> 01:09:33.237
So right here, right now tonight.

969
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:36.031
You decide who you are.

970
01:09:39.338 --> 01:09:41.124
So who are you gonna be?

971
01:09:42.299 --> 01:09:43.835
Who are you gonna be, Dylan?

972
01:09:44.134 --> 01:09:45.715
Nobody more, Eddie.

973
01:09:49.598 --> 01:09:51.008
Viva la revolution, right?

974
01:09:53.602 --> 01:09:54.842
That's what you've always said.

975
01:10:24.299 --> 01:10:26.335
The hell was that?

976
01:10:31.056 --> 01:10:32.762
Et phone home.

977
01:10:33.058 --> 01:10:34.343
Is that a signal?

978
01:10:34.643 --> 01:10:36.429
Yeah, a powerful one.

979
01:10:36.728 --> 01:10:37.888
Jam it.

980
01:10:38.188 --> 01:10:38.847
What?

981
01:10:39.147 --> 01:10:40.933
Use the computer to jam the signal.

982
01:10:41.233 --> 01:10:42.473
How can a laptop do that?

983
01:10:42.776 --> 01:10:44.545
1 don't know, just reverse
the polarity or something.


984
01:10:44.569 --> 01:10:46.275
Reverse the polarity of what?

985
01:10:46.571 --> 01:10:48.491
I don't know, I don't
even know what polarity is.


986
01:10:48.532 --> 01:10:51.490
Just, we need to get a far away
as possible from that thing.


987
01:10:56.623 --> 01:10:58.409
How much power do
you think that's using?


988
01:10:59.501 --> 01:11:01.412
Hard to say exactly.

989
01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:02.712
Roughly?

990
01:11:05.549 --> 01:11:06.549
Lots.

991
01:11:07.301 --> 01:11:08.736
Well, it cant be
getting that much power


992
01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.093
from car batteries and radios and stuff.

993
01:11:14.808 --> 01:11:15.923
The power grid.

994
01:11:16.226 --> 01:11:18.012
It must have hooked into the power grid.

995
01:11:20.147 --> 01:11:21.307
Dylan.

996
01:11:22.566 --> 01:11:23.806
You've got that face.

997
01:11:26.069 --> 01:11:28.025
I love it when you get that face.

998
01:11:38.623 --> 01:11:40.184
What are you guys standing around for?

999
01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:42.164
It's time to kick the
tires, light the fire.


1000
01:11:45.714 --> 01:11:48.046

j I'm the only one
out here how can see »

1007
01:12:09.905 --> 01:12:11.799
without me, you can find the
crash site from here, yeah?


1008
01:12:11.823 --> 01:12:13.529
Yes.

1009
01:12:13.825 --> 01:12:15.110
Good.

1010
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:17.321
You three go and collect
all the alien slime.


1011
01:12:17.621 --> 01:12:18.639
What are we meant to do with it?

1012
01:12:18.663 --> 01:12:19.743
Throw handfuls of it?

1013
01:12:20.749 --> 01:12:23.616
1 gotabetter idea.

1014
01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:26.451
We're gonna weaponize that shit.

1015
01:12:27.464 --> 01:12:29.000
You can handle that, right?

1016
01:12:29.299 --> 01:12:30.630
'Course, I'm a genius.

1017
01:12:30.926 --> 01:12:32.132
Good.

1018
01:12:32.427 --> 01:12:34.227
You three go, I'll meet
you at the puppy farm.


1019
01:12:34.388 --> 01:12:36.094
Wait, hold on, wait,
where are you going?


1020
01:12:38.850 --> 01:12:40.715
I'm gonna cut this
alien bitch's power supply


1021
01:12:41.019 --> 01:12:42.134
off at its source,

1022
01:12:42.437 --> 01:12:44.473
so you need to distract it from me.

1023
01:12:44.773 --> 01:12:46.229
You got this?

1024
01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:50.277
Yeah.

1025
01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:51.605
I know kung fu, remember?

1026
01:12:54.282 --> 01:12:56.162
And what about you, you
ready to kick the tires,


1027
01:12:56.243 --> 01:12:57.243
light some fires?

1028
01:12:57.536 --> 01:12:58.536
Bitch.

1029
01:12:59.204 --> 01:13:00.204
I was born ready.

1030
01:13:13.718 --> 01:13:18.257
J canon ball and
down town, down, down 2»

1031
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:40.195
And don't apocalypse us.

1032
01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:44.580
Did you forget about me?

1033
01:13:44.833 --> 01:13:46.573
I don't forget about.

1034
01:13:49.212 --> 01:13:50.247
You hurt my feelings.

1035
01:14:13.987 --> 01:14:16.444
Gonna let you live for a while.

1036
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.399
Why don't you know what it's like

1037
01:14:17.699 --> 01:14:18.984
not to have a face.

1038
01:14:19.284 --> 01:14:19.818
Are you gonna bark
all day, little bitch,


1039
01:14:20.118 --> 01:14:21.118
or are you gonna bite?

1040
01:14:43.433 --> 01:14:45.924
That's gonna be a little bit stingy.

1041
01:14:46.228 --> 01:14:47.228
Bit stingy.

1042
01:14:49.105 --> 01:14:50.766
Look who's dead.

1043
01:14:51.066 --> 01:14:53.102
And put it in there.

1044
01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:56.935
And one more for good luck.

1045
01:14:59.032 --> 01:15:01.239
Yeah.

1046
01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:10.620
I think we're
gonna need a bigger quiche.


1047
01:15:10.919 --> 01:15:12.034
More power.

1048
01:15:15.465 --> 01:15:18.423
Contact established.

1049
01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:22.256
Relaying coordinates.

1050
01:15:23.765 --> 01:15:26.757
Sending, sending.

1051
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:31.808
Soon we will be many.

1052
01:15:39.614 --> 01:15:41.855
She hasn't cut the power lines yet.

1053
01:15:44.077 --> 01:15:46.068
We need to buy her some more time.

1054
01:15:46.371 --> 01:15:47.656
Reckless violence.

1055
01:15:47.956 --> 01:15:48.975
Definitely reckless violence.

1056
01:15:48.999 --> 01:15:51.331
Don't break, whoa, whoa,
just hold your horses there.


1057
01:15:51.626 --> 01:15:52.626
What the fuck?

1058
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:53.203
Let's maybe think of a plan

1059
01:15:53.503 --> 01:15:55.994
that doesn't get us
all immediately killed.


1060
01:15:58.425 --> 01:16:00.586
Maybe we could do some flanking

1061
01:16:00.885 --> 01:16:02.546
or maybe like a pincer retreat?

1062
01:16:02.846 --> 01:16:03.380
You know, you go around that way,

1063
01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:04.214
and I go around this way,

1064
01:16:04.514 --> 01:16:06.379
and we just, kinda just spit balling here.

1065
01:16:06.683 --> 01:16:08.548
You can give me a hand.

1066
01:16:08.852 --> 01:16:10.592
Sounds like cardio.

1067
01:16:10.895 --> 01:16:11.895
I don't do cardio.

1068
01:16:14.608 --> 01:16:15.608
Okay.

1069
01:16:15.817 --> 01:16:16.817
What do you think?

1070
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:25.486
Crap my life.

1071
01:16:29.164 --> 01:16:30.529
I come in peace.

1072
01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:35.868
On behalf of mankind,
I'd like to welcome you


1073
01:16:36.171 --> 01:16:40.039
to our world and come
to a mutual understand.


1074
01:16:41.509 --> 01:16:42.589
We can all be friends.

1075
01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:46.589
What the?

1076
01:16:46.890 --> 01:16:47.549
She's gonna get us all killed

1077
01:16:47.849 --> 01:16:49.049
with this Star Trek bull shit.

1078
01:16:49.309 --> 01:16:51.516
Do you understand
the concept of friendship?


1079
01:16:51.811 --> 01:16:55.395
It's one of mankind's
most noble qualities.


1080
01:16:56.858 --> 01:17:00.942
You wish to make friends with me?

1081
01:17:02.989 --> 01:17:04.445
Yes.

1082
01:17:04.741 --> 01:17:05.776
Friends.

1083
01:17:06.076 --> 01:17:07.361
We can be friends.

1084
01:17:08.912 --> 01:17:12.245
We do not make friends with our food.

1085
01:17:17.712 --> 01:17:19.623
No, we can find a way.

1086
01:17:19.923 --> 01:17:22.084
There is no way.

1087
01:17:22.384 --> 01:17:23.419
There is only chaos.

1088
01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:25.959
Be quick stripe, chaos, yeah!

1089
01:17:41.069 --> 01:17:43.025
Excuse me, I think I
wanna murder you now.


1090
01:17:48.576 --> 01:17:50.032
Boom, baby.

1091
01:18:15.019 --> 01:18:16.019
All right, bitch.

1092
01:18:16.896 --> 01:18:17.896
You wanna fight?

1093
01:18:21.943 --> 01:18:22.943
Yeah?

1094
01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.446
Oh my.

1095
01:18:37.917 --> 01:18:38.917
Game on, mol.

1096
01:18:49.971 --> 01:18:50.971
Pointy.

1097
01:18:52.307 --> 01:18:54.218
Barbed wire in the butt?

1098
01:18:55.435 --> 01:18:56.925
Don't move, baby.

1099
01:18:59.564 --> 01:19:00.929
It's tango.

1100
01:19:05.945 --> 01:19:06.604
This is bullshit.

1101
01:19:06.905 --> 01:19:07.905
Take this.

1102
01:19:09.532 --> 01:19:11.318
Oh, my hair.

1103
01:19:11.618 --> 01:19:12.733
Eat rubber.

1104
01:19:14.496 --> 01:19:15.496
That hurt.

1105
01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:23.876
I know kung fu.

1106
01:19:36.476 --> 01:19:39.593
This is what you get, mother fuckers!

1107
01:19:53.368 --> 01:19:54.368
Endo apocalypso.

1108
01:20:09.509 --> 01:20:11.374
Did we just save the world?

1109
01:20:11.678 --> 01:20:13.589
I think we just saved the world.

1110
01:20:14.722 --> 01:20:15.722
Fuck yeah.

1111
01:20:16.015 --> 01:20:16.549
Yeah.

1112
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:18.556
When will you punks understand,

1113
01:20:19.769 --> 01:20:22.226
you can't fight city hall?

1114
01:20:37.954 --> 01:20:38.954
I brought muffins.

1115
01:20:40.123 --> 01:20:41.363
I love muffins.

1116
01:20:43.084 --> 01:20:44.699
So did we save the world?

1117
01:20:45.003 --> 01:20:46.539
Darn tooting we did.

1118
01:20:54.888 --> 01:20:57.755
You are already a child of chaos.

1119
01:20:59.767 --> 01:21:00.767
Join me.

1120
