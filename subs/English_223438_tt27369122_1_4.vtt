00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.170
HE CHUCKLES SOFTLY
I want to do that again.


2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.490
Oh, probably shouldn't
get too carried away.


3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.890
It's hard not to, after that.

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.330
HE CHUCKLES
It is.


5
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.530
But...

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.010
..I need to go back to my partner,
and you yours.


7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.290
That's how this works, I'm afraid.

8
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.450
DOOR OPENS

9
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.210
Didn't go well?

10
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.530
Jesus, Danny,
I have been waiting for you.


11
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.490
Someone has found our photos,
and our video,


12
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.290
and they posted it online.

13
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.130
They're making me sound like
I'm some kind of sex worker,


14
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.450
touting for business.

15
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.690
What the hell?
There's a link on my social media


16
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.650
and everyone has seen it.

17
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.970
Did you send our video to anyone?
No. No, of course not.


18
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.850
Then how has someone found it?!

19
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.130
I don't know.

20
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130
I'm going to find out...

21
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.650
..I promise.

22
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.450
I thought I saw an intruder
so I sent Alan around,


23
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.210
and then when he didn't come back,
I went to check.


24
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.450
We think he's had a stroke,
Mrs Richardson,


25
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.850
so we need to get him
to the hospital as soon as possible.


26
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.130
Yes, of course.

27
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.970
You can accompany him
in the ambulance, if you like. Yeah.


28
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.410
So, this isn't your house?

29
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.690
No. The owners are out of town,
but I'll contact them.


30
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.330
Pete.

31
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.650
HE CHUCKLES SOFTLY

32
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.410
Bye. Bye. See you later.

33
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.290
SHE SIGHS

34
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.010
CAR DOOR SHUTS

35
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.290
ENGINE STARTS

36
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.410
Look, why don't we do
something nice tonight?


37
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.810
Go to the pub, maybe?

38
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.650
You're just going to act
like everything's normal.


39
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.090
How else do you want me to act?

40
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.770
Pete, no-one died.

41
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.410
I get that it was a bit awkward,
but Becka don't mind.


42
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.290
Honestly, don't beat yourself up.

43
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.650
I'm going to clean out the shed.

44
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.850
OK, yeah.

45
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.450
Yeah, thanks for your help.

46
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.690
They can find the owner of the blog,
but it might take a while.


47
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.330
What, and in the meantime,
it just stays online?


48
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.410
Well, just delete the comment
with the link on it.


49
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.770
Well, obviously I've deleted
the comment, Danny.


50
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.450
Sorry. Sorry.

51
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.810
I know. I know, it's awful,
but...don't worry.


52
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.970
We'll get them.

53
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.370
Yeah.

54
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.490
Fuck, the door is open.

55
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.490
Did you leave it like this? No.

56
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.130
I was just in the bedroom,
and I checked.


57
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.850
The camera's still there,
but something's not right.


58
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.370
I feel like someone's been in here.

59
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.530
Yeah,
I'll get some colleagues onto it.


60
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.450
What are you doing?

61
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.850
Nothing.

62
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.050
See you later, love.

63
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.170
Morning.

64
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.450
Is this all we've got?

65
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.570
What, have you given up
talking to me now?


66
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.010
I'm off.

67
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.090
All right? I think Spencer
broke into my house, now this.


68
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.530
What's this?

69
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.450
Oh, shit.

70
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.610
I'm not having that prick
threaten my family -


71
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.970
you make that clear to him.

72
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.970
Mate, you're going to have
to do that yourself.


73
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.770
I've told you, we can't keep
running away from this, Dan.


74
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.930
We owe him money,
and he wants payback.


75
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.650
Take that and put it in the house.

76
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.130
Shit. What are you playing at?!

77
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.250
It's mine.

78
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.170
I thought it'd give you peace of mind
until we get him off our back.


79
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.530
Is he that dangerous?

80
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.610
MUTED: You knew exactly
who he was...


81
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.330
THEY ARGUE INDISTINCTLY

82
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.410
We need to go and see him, Dan.

83
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.930
Wait here.

84
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.450
CAR DOOR SHUTS

85
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.890
Hiya.

86
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.730
No-one.

87
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.210
I'm afraid we're going
to have to suspend your classes.


88
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:27.450
Just take some time off and...and...
let's stay in touch, yeah?


89
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.370
Oh, yeah, how was the spa weekend?

90
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.850
It was OK.

91
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.290
God, you're hard to please.

92
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.210
Jeez, come on.
That place sounded amazing.


93
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.850
Like I said, it was fine.

94
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.530
OK, well, I have something
that might cheer you up.


95
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.130
Who said I needed cheering up?

96
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.850
Jesus, all right.
Won't bother, then. God.


97
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.770
Sorry.

98
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.370
Go on.

99
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.570
That's all right.
SHE CLEARS THROAT


100
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.330
So, I was looking through the shots
I took of the cops,


101
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.650
and I found a picture where
you can see the guy's face clearly.


102
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.290
I saw this guy this morning.

103
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.290
He was talking to my neighbour.
They were having a right barney.


104
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.930
Wait, didn't you say
your neighbour was a traffic cop?


105
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.330
No, I already asked him.
He said he wasn't there.


106
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.570
Yeah, but do you believe him?
Um, I'm looking for Pete.


107
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.850
Uh, he's just at the back there.

108
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.970
Thank you. No worries.
Um, someone's here to see you.


109
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.610
Um...

110
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.330
..that's his wife.

111
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.050
Uh, excuse me.

112
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.370
Hey.

113
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.570
Um, I have had
a couple of classes cancelled,


114
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.570
so I was wondering
if you had time for a coffee.


115
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.330
Um...

116
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.570
Yeah, sure.

117
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.130
Great.

118
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.050
We...

119
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.530
We don't need to hash it out.
It's all...fine.


120
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.850
Is it, though?

121
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.370
It didn't seem like it
when you left.


122
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.370
Pete, I don't like
to leave things broken,


123
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:38.370
so I need you to tell me
if I have broken anything.


124
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.050
Um...

125
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.850
..I find all of this really awkward.

126
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.410
I can normally tell a mile off

127
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.210
if one partner is keen
and the other one isn't,


128
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.170
but honestly,

129
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.450
it's nearly always the man
who is pressuring the woman, so...


130
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.330
And Evie gave me the green light
from both of you,


131
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.250
so I thought it would...
What? Did she?


132
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.330
Yeah.

133
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.770
So, you weren't on board?

134
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:25.130
I honestly...don't know. Um...

135
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.250
OK, well...

136
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.530
..I just hope
that we can still be friends.


137
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.930
Yeah. Um...

138
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.810
Jesus Christ.

139
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.130
'Ey up.

140
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.890
It's been a while.

141
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.730
Glad you finally saw sense.

142
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.810
Did you break into my house?

143
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.730
What? No.

144
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.010
Not yet, anyway.

145
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.530
Keep your fucking goons
away from my son.


146
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.330
Danny... You said "son".
Just the one, is that right?


147
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.010
Don't push me.

148
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.090
That's precisely
what I've been doing.


149
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.290
All right, OK. Step back then,
Danny, for fuck's sake.


150
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.970
Or you will find out
how far I'm willing to go.


151
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.890
I will hurt your family. Whoa, whoa.
Do you understand that, copper?


152
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.890
That's enough of that chat.

153
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.170
Let's not go there, eh?

154
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.050
We've come to cooperate.

155
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.770
All right, Danny?

156
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.970
Aren't we, Danny?

157
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.370
Let's just...

158
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.730
What do you want?

159
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:56.330
Well, you had some things of mine,

160
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.690
but then you lost 'em...

161
00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.050
..so you need to go and find 'em
and bring 'em back to me.


162
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.130
What? Are you serious?

163
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.370
If it were easy,
I'd be doing it myself.


164
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.210
Who was it?

165
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.450
They're not local.

166
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.490
I've leant on plenty of folk.

167
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.970
It's not the usual suspects.

168
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.490
Talk is there's a crew
from out of town running the docks.


169
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:20.850
You got any names?

170
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.170
Nope.

171
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.810
Cheer up, lads.

172
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.330
It shouldn't be too difficult

173
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.930
for a pair of action heroes
like yourselves.


174
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.210
Now, fuck off, the pair of you.

175
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.050
Dan...

176
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.010
EVIE: Danny.

177
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.570
Danny!

178
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.690
Are you avoiding me? What?

179
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.170
It was a really big thing for me.
Is it always like that, or...?


180
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.210
No.

181
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.570
No.

182
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.650
SHE LAUGHS

183
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.690
Oh, I'm not the only one.

184
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.490
I can't stop thinking about you.

185
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.450
I get it, but it's...
it's a bit dangerous.


186
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.090
It's dangerous because...?

187
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.130
You know why.

188
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.010
Well, yeah.

189
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.330
Look, you're so gorgeous and...

190
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.930
..yeah, I want you...

191
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.530
We can't go there if our partners
aren't on board, can we?


192
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.490
But what if they were?
But yours isn't.


193
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.010
Yeah, but he'll come around.

194
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.730
But until he does,
we can't go there again.


195
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.650
Take care of yourself, yeah?

196
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.650
ON TV: Which means
you've earned two points


197
00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.570
from a total of 20 points, OK?

198
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.490
You've now got ten points
to pick up.


199
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.570
You've now only got 15.5 seconds
to choose.


200
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.970
Next category,
your next question is music.


201
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.330
You've got 15.5 seconds remaining.

202
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.490
HE SWITCHES TV OFF

203
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.490
We need to have
a difficult conversation


204
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.970
if we're going to move on.

205
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.290
OK.

206
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.130
That night...

207
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.810
..you told Becka I was up for it.

208
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.130
I never said that.
Pete, that isn't true.


209
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.890
We talked about it.

210
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.650
I-I didn't plan this.
It just happened.


211
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.530
It did not just happen.

212
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.610
You MADE it happen.

213
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.130
SHE SIGHS

214
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.050
What did you do with him?

215
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.050
Oh, come on. Really?

216
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.690
Did you fuck him?

217
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.210
SHE SCOFFS

218
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.890
Did you?
We just messed around a bit.


219
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.690
Look, we took this risk
to see if it would work for us.


220
00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.890
Ah, well, it obviously worked
for you, didn't it?


221
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.290
And it would have worked for you
if you chilled out about it.


222
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.330
Pete, the amount of men
who'd give their right arm


223
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.570
for a night with Becka.
Oh, so, it's my fault, is it?


224
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:21.930
Because I didn't just chill out?

225
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.530
You're the one who didn't want
to become boring and suburban.


226
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.330
There's nothing
more boring and suburban


227
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.930
than trying to fuck the neighbours.

228
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.250
Look...

229
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.370
..I am sad that
this has made you angry...


230
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.370
..but you don't need to be.

231
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.170
I know you fucked him.

232
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.730
Hi, mate.

233
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.850
All right, mate.

234
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.170
Roseville Road.
Colossus Building Supplies.


235
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.930
Apparently, run by a guy
called Eddie Smallwood.


236
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.170
Sorry, what's this?
You'll have to remind me.


237
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.370
HE CHUCKLES

238
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.130
Last week...

239
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.490
..I think you lied.

240
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.050
I think you were there.

241
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.890
Are you angry with me
about something?


242
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.370
It seems like you might be.

243
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.970
If so...

244
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.090
..let's have it out. No, no.
Colossus Building Supplies, OK?


245
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.050
It's actually owned
by Robbie Spencer,


246
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.690
and that's who you were talking to.

247
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.570
But why would he need
two traffic cops, hmm?


248
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.530
You protecting something?

249
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.130
I mean, it's obviously not
building supplies, is it?


250
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.930
I mean this really sincerely,
because I genuinely like you.


251
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.210
I think you're a good guy.

252
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.530
I would really back off
on this one.


253
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.370
So, it was you?

254
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.930
Whatever you're chasing,
it's not worth it just for a story.


255
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.410
How about we talk off the record?
You're going to get hurt.


256
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.290
Maybe Evie, too.

257
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.210
Is that what you want?

258
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.490
MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTS

259
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.770
Right, Alan,
let's get you inside, shall we?


260
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.130
Thanks for all your help.

261
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.850
You know where we are
if you need us.


262
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.650
Yeah, I really do.
Thanks ever so much. Bye.


263
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.890
Back home, finally.

264
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.130
Yeah.

265
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.770
Did you manage something to eat?

266
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.050
N
-No.

267
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.530
Well, wouldn't you like
to try a little bit of soup?


268
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.250
No.

269
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.770
You need me now, don't you, Alan?

270
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.810
Do you know, I've barely had time
to try that stairlift


271
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.530
these last couple of weeks?

272
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.730
High time I took
a good look upstairs.


273
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.330
STAIRLIFT WHIRS

274
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.490
BELL RINGS,
CHILDREN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY


275
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.730
Right, class, that is playtime.

276
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.290
Walk, don't run.

277
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.890
Thank you.

278
00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.450
Oh, thank God!

279
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.090
SHE LAUGHS

280
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.530
TEARFULLY: Thank you, God,
for forgiving me.


281
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.970
Thank you for pursuing me, and...

282
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.530
..for showing me my worthiness.

283
00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.570
Thank you for blessing me
with this gift.


284
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.930
Hello.

285
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.730
Oh, thank you.

286
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.410
Mrs Whitwell, glad I caught you.

287
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.730
Hey, how are you doing?
Uh, good, thank you.


288
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.090
Um, listen,

289
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.690
we still need the payment
for the school trip.


290
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.170
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

291
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.650
Um, yes,
I will sort that right now.


292
00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.290
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Sorry about that.


293
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.890
Don't worry.
SHE CHUCKLES


294
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.450
INDISTINCT CHATTER IN BACKGROUND

295
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.650
Want anything else?

296
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.370
I've got something I know you want.

297
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.610
How did you get that photo, Alan?

298
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.890
Did you take it
or did you steal it?

299
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.650
Don't. Don't what?
Answer me, yes or no.


300
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.450
Did you steal it?

301
00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:57.490
You thought I was too old
and crocked and useless,


302
00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.970
so instead you sat up there,

303
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.370
fantasising over some unattainable
young woman.


304
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.410
Well...

305
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.290
..there you go.

306
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:10.330
You sit there and look.

307
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.690
Hiya. Just dropping Ollie home.
Becka needed to pop to the shops.


308
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.290
Oh, right, yeah. Thanks.
Bye, Evie. Bye!


309
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.090
See you later.

310
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.170
Hey, did you move money
from our savings account?


311
00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.170
Uh, don't think so.

312
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.250
I thought the loan

313
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.250
for the new kitchen
was in that account?


314
00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.730
Oh, yeah. I, uh...
gave a deposit to the builder.


315
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.850
Well, I think we should try
and get that back.


316
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.250
We don't have the money
for that work right now.


317
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.570
Yeah, it'll be fine.

318
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.450
Danny...

319
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.170
..I've effectively lost my job.

320
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.090
It's pretty serious.

321
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.170
How much did you give him?

322
00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.930
Uh, I don't remember.

323
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.330
What do you mean you don't remember?

324
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.570
Well, it can't have been all of it.

325
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.450
There was ten grand in there.

326
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.890
I'll check it tomorrow,
go see the builder.


327
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.090
I thought you had work tomorrow?

328
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:41.210
I do, but...don't worry,
I'll sort it.

Oh, Jean,

338
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.130
I'm so sorry to hear
about Alan's stroke.


339
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:43.170
Yeah, it's been very tough
but, you know, we're coping.


340
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.010
How did it happen?

341
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:49.130
Yeah, well, Alan's been having
headaches for a while now, so...


342
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.730
Lucky they found him at Becka's.

343
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.010
Mm, yeah. Sorry?

344
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.130
Oh, good morning, Becka. Morning.

345
00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.210
Now, you send my love to Alan, Jean.
I will, thanks.


346
00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:03.370
Hey. What's going on?
Oh, hi. I'm so glad to see you.


347
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.730
I meant to leave you a note,

348
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.450
but it's just been so hectic,
you know?


349
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.770
Um, as Gloria was saying,
they found Alan at yours,


350
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:12.770
because I thought I saw an intruder.

351
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.450
And when Alan went round,
your back doors were open.


352
00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:17.210
What? Yeah, I mean,

353
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.410
I think if there had been
anyone there,


354
00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.090
well, they'd obviously fled,
you know, before they got in.


355
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.210
Christ! Well, thank God Alan
was there to interrupt them.


356
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.250
Yeah, well, he had a good look around

357
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.250
and made sure nobody
was inside, you know?


358
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:35.050
Um, and that's why he had
the stroke in your house.


359
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.370
Oh, my God.

360
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.850
I hope the paramedics didn't leave
too much of a mess.


361
00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.930
I'm really sorry.
He was just trying to help.


362
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.930
No, no, no, Jean. Jean, I'm sorry.
That's awful.


363
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.770
Alan must have been so scared.

364
00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.690
Look, if there's anything
that I can do...


365
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.610
Um, I've done yoga before,
with stroke survivors.


366
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.170
Oh, no, honestly, it's OK,

367
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.370
because the hospital
have offered rehab, you know?


368
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.890
It wouldn't be a problem.

369
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.570
I mean, work is really slow
right now,


370
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.770
so, really,
you would be doing me a favour.


371
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.130
Well, in that case, you know,

372
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.410
maybe we could arrange something
sometime.


373
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.490
But I've really got
to be getting off, get back to him.

You been here before?

379
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.450
Thought it looked fun?

380
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.530
There you go.

381
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.690
Wow. Bigger than your head, that.

382
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.010
You not having one?

383
00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:08.450
No, I'm all right.

No?

Are you winding me up?

387
00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.490
You need to learn faster.

388
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:24.810
Fair enough.

389
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.050
Because I was hoping

390
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.690
that you and I could spend
lots of time together.


391
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.850
Why haven't I met you until now?

392
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.850
Because...

393
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.330
..your mother and I weren't in touch
for a long time.


394
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.130
Did you know about me?

395
00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.450
I did.

396
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.890
I can't tell you how sorry I am
I haven't been around.


397
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.890
Where do you live?

398
00:32:55.930 --> 00:33:00.530
Well, not far.
The other side of the city.


399
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.970
Who with?

400
00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.850
My...

401
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.690
My family.

402
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.810
Can I meet them?

403
00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.370
Well, let's see, hey?

404
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.250
You don't want me to?

405
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.010
Course I do.

406
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.170
Let's not rush, OK?

WHISPERS: Stupid.

408
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:55.570
Hiya, Mum. Oh! 
So good to see you!

CHATTER IN BACKGROUND
Oh, thanks for coming.


410
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.490
Pete sends his love.
He's just a bit tied up with work.


411
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.170
Oh, not to worry.

412
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.290
Oh, love, you shouldn't have.

413
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.210
Look, we're doing presents
in a bit,


414
00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.650
so I'll come back in a sec,
all right? Yeah. Yeah, sure.


415
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.490
Now, then... Hiya, Dad.

416
00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:17.690
Hello, you.

417
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.050
Ah!

418
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.210
Hey! Hello!

419
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.530
Hiya. Are you all right?
Hi. You look great.


420
00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.010
Oh! You've no idea
how much it means to Mum


421
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.250
that you're here, you know.

422
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.090
He's pleased, too, in his own way.

423
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.890
Rach, look at you!
Mm. Isn't she blooming, hmm?


424
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.650
He loves me being pregnant.

425
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.490
More than I do, probably.

426
00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.090
Sorry, sis. I didn't...

427
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.010
We don't have to talk about it.
I-I just...


428
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:47.290
No. It's... It's not that.

429
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.850
What?

430
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.290
You're not.

431
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.850
THEY LAUGH

432
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:55.410
Oh, Evie!

433
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.930
Oh, it's so hard not telling anyone!

434
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.490
Oh, just keep it...keep it quiet,
yeah? Yeah. It's so early.


435
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.410
Please, join us in prayer

436
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.090
before we start
the birthday celebrations.


437
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:09.810
Shh!

438
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.570
Our help is in
the name of the Lord.

439
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.530
ALL: Our help is in
the name of the Lord.


440
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.090
Maker of heaven and Earth.
Maker of heaven and Earth.


441
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.690
Evening. Evening.

442
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:22.530
And morning. And morning.
SPEECH FADES OUT


443
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.290
SPEECH FADES IN

444
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.930
Make haste, O God, to deliver me.

445
00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.810
Make haste to help me, O God.

446
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.410
Amen. Amen.

447
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.730
Amen.

448
00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:56.970
Well, if it isn't
our favourite grass.


449
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.810
Surprised to see you out so soon.

450
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.930
Early release for good behaviour.

451
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.890
You're a reformed man, no doubt.

452
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.370
Well, the food got even worse,

453
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.930
so, yeah,
I'd like to stay out, if I can.


454
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.290
Um, just one second, sorry.

455
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.650
So, have you got something?

456
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.650
There's a guy inside.

457
00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:19.530
He's part of some gang run
by this Belgian dude,


458
00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:22.410
who are running all the docks
on the east coast.


459
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:26.010
Their MO is intercepting
illegal cargo on the docks


460
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.850
being brought in by other criminals,
which they then sell on themselves.


461
00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.970
So, what are they nicking?
Any high-value goods,


462
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.810
but the more untraceable,
the better.


463
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.970
This Belgian guy, Lars something,
he's got one interest -


464
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:44.130
uncut diamonds,
which he can trade in Antwerp.


465
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.690
Where are they based?

466
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.570
Come on, Noddy.

467
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.810
You wouldn't be here
unless you had an address.


468
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:55.850
500.

Get stuffed. Two grand, minimum.


470
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.970
One.

471
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.250
I'll chuck in a packet
of pork scratchings.


472
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.450
Come on, Noddy.

473
00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.170
It's good money, this.

474
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.050
We could tell you need it.

475
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.570
Get Maps up on your phone.

476
00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:29.650

Oh.


478
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.810
Oh, thank you.
All right, love? Yeah.


479
