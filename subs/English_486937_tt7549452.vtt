00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:09.141
Hey, Cenk, buddy, what's up?

2
00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:11.101
Where are you? 
I'm already at the place ... ah ...

3
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.520
Come over here. 
I'm already waiting here.

4
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:15.355
Hurry up. What's up? Hurry.

5
00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:19.777
Yo, bro, don't scream at me like that.

6
00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:21.153
I'll be there soon. Ok?

7
00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:22.362
I just have to do something quick.

8
00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:28.077
Wazzup?

9
00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:30.537
What's up Akhi?

10
00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:31.580
All good?

11
00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:33.624
Yeah, man, what's up?

12
00:01:36.044 --> 00:01:37.920
Nice to see you bro.

13
00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:41.215
What's up?

14
00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:44.218
Buddy, I already thought you're not coming.
I wanted to bail.


15
00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.968
How are things doing?

16
00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:45.803
Fine, bro.

17
00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:46.720
Yeah?

18
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:47.471
All good?

19
00:01:47.472 --> 00:01:49.807
Yeah, bro, I'm quite busy.
Business runs well.


20
00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:51.141
I've got good stuff.

21
00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:54.103
I hear a lot about you. 
People are talking a lot about you.

22
00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:55.521
I hope only in a good manner.

23
00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:58.816
Only good things, bro!
But there are fake guys as well that are listening too.


24
00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:01.026
We have to watch out.
Should we do this right here or should we go


25
00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:01.902
for a walk a little?

26
00:02:01.903 --> 00:02:04.238
Yeah, bro, yeah.
Let's walk a bit.


27
00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:07.241
Everything else good?
How's your wife?


28
00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:10.702
Bro, she's getting on my nerves.
She's saying that I should go look for normal work.


29
00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:13.831
I've done this temporary-work-company thing 2 months now.

30
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:20.379
And the third month I had to quit that shit.
That's why I'm back hustlen the street, you know.


31
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.967
Now I'm not needing just one bag.
I got this bag to give a few people samples,


32
00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:26.301
one or two joints.

33
00:02:27.137 --> 00:02:30.264
And after that I'm probably getting half a
package or a whole package.


34
00:02:30.473 --> 00:02:33.100
Ok, no problem. 
I'm always here for you, brother.

35
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:34.268
That's the best dope, buddy.

36
00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.562
That's the best mobile phone
for this by the way.

37
00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:41.567
Less technology, less cops. 
It's better that way.

38
00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:44.278
We've wasted enough time already, buddy.
We've learned from that.


39
00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:46.488
The same mistake won't happen again.

40
00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.158
Right now, there are many
cops on the move, you know.

41
00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.367
Yes, I'm getting that too.

42
00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:53.704
We see that all the
time, bron to be honest.

43
00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:54.496
What?

44
00:02:54.747 --> 00:02:58.667
I've got a question. What's with coke, bro?
Can you sell some coke?


45
00:02:59.586 --> 00:03:05.591
I would have to ask around a bit, but rather not.
I tell you, to be completely honest, I don't want


46
00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:07.926
anything to do which such things.

47
00:03:08.428 --> 00:03:14.600
I'm a very vulnerable guy, you know that?
You give me 10 grams, I do it by myself and then I owe you.


48
00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:16.852
We both dont't want that, right?

49
00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:19.313
Then fuck this, then I'm just giving you
a little bit of dope.


50
00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:22.941
A bit dope, bro?
I didn't even give you the money yet.


51
00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.110
Here are twenty euros bro.

52
00:03:27.322 --> 00:03:28.780
It's good stuff!

53
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.116
What time is it? 
What are you up to now?

54
00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:32.743
No idea.
I'm doing a few deals, buddy.


55
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.161
I have to go to the boys.

56
00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.787
Are they at the place?

57
00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:37.080
Much action, yes, yes.

58
00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:38.749
Mio is waiting, you know.

59
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.668
Alright, my wife's waiting for me too.
Greet the guys from me.


60
00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.046
They're always stressing us,
bro, am I right? Yeah.

61
00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:45.422
I heard it, buddy.

62
00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:47.507
Bye, bro. Be careful.

63
00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:51.011
Yeah, be careful bro!
Stay stabil. Talk to you.

64
00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:52.221
See ya.

65
00:03:52.388 --> 00:03:52.971
Ciao, bro.

66
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.542
Memo. Give me the spitting glass, gangster.

67
00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:35.681
Three points.

68
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.142
That's what it looks
like. They fucked me, LAN.

69
00:04:39.894 --> 00:04:40.686
Who?

70
00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:42.062
These sons of bitches.

71
00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:43.272
Who?

72
00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:47.943
They kicked me out of the kindergarten, man. 
I'm unemployed.

73
00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.152
For real?

74
00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:50.362
For real!

75
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:54.950
Let's just push up, man.
I've got good coke here.


76
00:04:55.118 --> 00:04:56.952
From Jimmie, the nigger.

77
00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:00.998
They kicked you out of the kindergarten?

78
00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:05.419
They fired me and they fucked me.
These motherfuckers.


79
00:05:05.586 --> 00:05:11.758
Listen, do you remember this news article about me?
Men in womens' jobs bla bla bla ...


80
00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.721
... role model and so on.
The fucking cops have seen this, man.


81
00:05:15.888 --> 00:05:20.392
And they weren't happy with a boy from the hood working as
an educator.


82
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.977
These motherfuckers.

83
00:05:23.521 --> 00:05:24.521
Assholes.

84
00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:26.023
They fired me.

85
00:05:26.024 --> 00:05:26.898
Assholes.

86
00:05:27.358 --> 00:05:30.360
Such assholes!
Sons of bitches.


87
00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:35.949
Doesn't matter, we've got coke here.
Sekerim Amonakoim.


88
00:05:36.117 --> 00:05:41.038
Aaah, fuck this, man.
And what are you doing, bro?


89
00:05:41.247 --> 00:05:43.957
Still looking for a job?

90
00:05:45.877 --> 00:05:47.336
I have bigger dreams.

91
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:54.593
Tell me your dreams. 
About big tits and butts.

92
00:05:55.386 --> 00:06:05.386
Well, I'm asking this question myself all the time.
Either a million euros or Kim Kardashian.


93
00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:08.523
A million lines of coke, man!

94
00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:10.567
That would be great, man!

95
00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:15.405
You want some dreams?
I'll give you dreams.


96
00:06:15.573 --> 00:06:21.036
With this white powder.
Listen, light up this joint.


97
00:06:21.204 --> 00:06:24.581
Ooooh, this is the shit, man!

98
00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:27.376
These are powerful lines.

99
00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.641
Bro, who's that dope for? For you?

100
00:06:42.642 --> 00:06:45.977
No, that's not for me.
A few Russians are soon coming along.


101
00:06:46.145 --> 00:06:47.646
They wanted to get some.

102
00:06:47.897 --> 00:06:49.398
Mhm. Good.

103
00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:52.526
Man, What are you up to, bro? 
Everything's cool?

104
00:06:52.527 --> 00:06:54.653
Mhm. I'm high as fuck, bro.

105
00:06:54.654 --> 00:07:00.450
I'm getting high too. But right now, 
I'm still good.

106
00:07:00.952 --> 00:07:03.203
Man, that's really some strong dope, bro!

107
00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:05.831
Some wodi isn't bad as well.

108
00:07:10.086 --> 00:07:11.545
This is hitting really hard, isn't it?

109
00:07:11.712 --> 00:07:12.295
Yeah!

110
00:07:12.422 --> 00:07:13.672
Really good stuff!

111
00:07:14.424 --> 00:07:15.841
But there's still room for a little bit.

112
00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:18.927
When are the Russians coming?

113
00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:24.599
They should be here soon, let's take a look.
Yeah, they're coming soon, man.


114
00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:28.937
They said they're soon there.
So let's finish this quick.


115
00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:39.698
The Russians, bro. There they are. 
What's up Bljad?

116
00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:40.490
Oh, howdy boys!

117
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:41.658
Did you miss us?

118
00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:42.325
Of course.

119
00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:44.286
A-yo, what's up Mio?

120
00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:45.078
Everything's fine.

121
00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:48.290
Everything okay with you too, bro? What's up?

122
00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:49.875
Howdy, Bljad.

123
00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:50.876
Howdy, everything's fine?

124
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:53.420
How are things looking? 
You've got dope, haven't you?

125
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.464
We got some really good stuff here, buddy!

126
00:07:55.465 --> 00:07:57.132
Yeah man! It's really good!

127
00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:57.632
Let's see.

128
00:07:57.633 --> 00:07:59.176
This will fuck you up.

129
00:07:59.427 --> 00:08:03.180
How are things looking with Para?
Have you got some Para with you?


130
00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:03.972
Always!

131
00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:07.642
Ahhh, Para is always good. 
Para is always good, boys.

132
00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:08.935
Are you drinking?

133
00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:09.978
Nothing goes without cash.

134
00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:10.937
Why, you want some too?

135
00:08:11.272 --> 00:08:11.980
Fill it up.

136
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:15.650
Actually you can drink from the bottle,
since you're a Russian, bro.


137
00:08:15.902 --> 00:08:18.570
Don't be like that. 
Fill up the cup.

138
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:19.863
Give it to him.

139
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.281
We're humans too.

140
00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:28.413
Of course, I didn't say that you're not humans.
But you're drinking vodka in the morning like it was water.


141
00:08:28.414 --> 00:08:29.748
You got something to try, Cenk?

142
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:30.248
Huh?

143
00:08:30.249 --> 00:08:32.083
Do you have something to try?

144
00:08:32.418 --> 00:08:35.003
Let the boys pull a
little to give them the taste.

145
00:08:35.004 --> 00:08:38.715
Here you go, Buddy.
What is with you?


146
00:08:39.091 --> 00:08:42.385
I'm waiting until you
put some vodka in here.

147
00:08:42.386 --> 00:08:43.720
Shall I drink for you too?

148
00:08:44.096 --> 00:08:48.808
No, I drink it myself, but ... 
I'm a guest, you're here ...

149
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:50.018
At home.

150
00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:52.521
It's much better than the last time.

151
00:08:53.397 --> 00:08:56.274
Dude, that's extremely good haze, buddy.
This is going to fuck you up real good.


152
00:08:56.442 --> 00:08:58.443
You can go play
PlayStation the whole night, dude.

153
00:08:58.444 --> 00:08:59.402
Haha, give it to him.

154
00:08:59.403 --> 00:08:59.903
Or ...

155
00:08:59.904 --> 00:09:00.946
You can gamble, right?

156
00:09:00.947 --> 00:09:03.782
Or you can sit in the barracks or
whatever you're doing all day.


157
00:09:04.408 --> 00:09:09.329
But you know what?
These little brats were getting on my nerves anyway.


158
00:09:09.497 --> 00:09:14.084
I need bigger things, dude.
I'm destined for something greater!


159
00:09:15.002 --> 00:09:16.336
I've always told you that.

160
00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:24.886
Give me the fuse.
The blub is killing men dude. pull some fine stuff up your


161
00:09:25.054 --> 00:09:28.598
nose.
Then you've got your Kim Kardashian.


162
00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:29.683
Oh Fuck.

163
00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:31.268
Perhaps even all siblings.

164
00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:38.608
And the father too. 
He's become a pussy now. 
Like the cops.

165
00:09:38.609 --> 00:09:39.568
That's rubbish.

166
00:09:42.697 --> 00:09:47.701
Boy, there's still half of it lying there, what's wrong with
you kanak?


167
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.497
Since you're staying at home all day, you've become a real
pussy.


168
00:09:52.665 --> 00:09:54.332
Whaiii, Tony Montana!

169
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:56.001
Yeahn man!

170
00:09:56.002 --> 00:10:03.258
Bro, you've got something hanging in your beard.
Gimme the lighter, dude.


171
00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:09.764
Good. You're still the same, chilling all day and watching
porn.


172
00:10:09.932 --> 00:10:13.101
Aren't you sick of Elizabeth?

173
00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:16.855
Am I supposed to
watch insect documentaries or what?

174
00:10:18.024 --> 00:10:18.982
Why not?

175
00:10:22.153 --> 00:10:23.403
Oh, man, Apo.

176
00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:24.362
Check this fuse out, dude.

177
00:10:24.947 --> 00:10:25.614
Oh, man Apo.

178
00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:28.658
Start fucking the pussies instead of your hand.

179
00:10:34.457 --> 00:10:35.206
Yeah, man ...

180
00:10:35.207 --> 00:10:39.961
Let's bring in some tobacco into the mix.
What's wrong with you?


181
00:10:40.129 --> 00:10:44.924
You got no money and then you're blowing away all the
marijuana.


182
00:10:45.092 --> 00:10:47.135
Oh Fuck.You want a head?

183
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:50.805
I gotta stop watching porn.

184
00:10:52.892 --> 00:10:58.647
You gotta stop chilling all day on the couch and jacking
off.


185
00:10:58.814 --> 00:11:06.988
But you know what?I'mstuck with you.
Since I'm unemployed now I need to deal with you.


186
00:11:07.156 --> 00:11:10.075
Or you need to deal with me.

187
00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:12.452
Awesome.

188
00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:13.953
Mega awesome!

189
00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:16.122
Awesome ! Awesome man!

190
00:11:16.499 --> 00:11:17.832
Let's smoke to that.

191
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:18.958
AwesomeG Go ahead.

192
00:11:21.212 --> 00:11:22.587
Do we have Jaegermeister here?

193
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:24.547
Of course man!

194
00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:29.511
Fuck.

195
00:11:35.184 --> 00:11:36.142
Coke?

196
00:11:38.354 --> 00:11:41.815
I don't want this coke. 
I want that coke.

197
00:11:43.734 --> 00:11:49.280
This, GBL. Try one or
two drops and then it's over.

198
00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:52.033
Ace.Thanks, bro.

199
00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:55.078
Great. Thanks, bro.

200
00:11:56.789 --> 00:12:02.168
Hey Bljad, you have to watch out around here.
The cops are very active right now.


201
00:12:02.336 --> 00:12:06.172
They have already fucked a few guy.
Harkan has been ...


202
00:12:06.173 --> 00:12:09.467
The older Russians of us got fucked too!
This is really shit Bljad!


203
00:12:11.262 --> 00:12:15.140
They're also looking brutal, bro.
To to be honest, if I was a cop, I'd stop them as well.


204
00:12:15.516 --> 00:12:16.141
Yeah.

205
00:12:16.142 --> 00:12:21.563
Who got them out anyway, buddy? 
Are this Cheches? No idea.

206
00:12:21.564 --> 00:12:22.397
Yes.

207
00:12:22.732 --> 00:12:24.482
Hamdela brother, these are muslin, hm?

208
00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:26.401
What can we do?

209
00:12:27.903 --> 00:12:29.028
What are you up to now?

210
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:30.488
Nothing, we'll smoke a little bit.

211
00:12:30.489 --> 00:12:31.072
Same, bro.

212
00:12:31.282 --> 00:12:33.283
Just like you, drinking, smoking.

213
00:12:33.617 --> 00:12:34.325
Where is myjoint?

214
00:12:35.745 --> 00:12:36.745
Here, bro.

215
00:12:37.121 --> 00:12:38.121
What are you up to now?

216
00:12:38.497 --> 00:12:39.247
We chill, bro.

217
00:12:39.373 --> 00:12:41.040
Yes? We are going then Bljad.

218
00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:42.542
You're going or what?

219
00:12:42.793 --> 00:12:44.002
You're welcome to show up again.

220
00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:45.128
Be easy!

221
00:12:47.047 --> 00:12:49.090
If nothing's there anymore you can come back.

222
00:12:50.342 --> 00:12:53.303
Be careful, ciao. Ciao. Bye.

223
00:12:58.142 --> 00:12:58.808
Cool guys, huh?

224
00:12:58.893 --> 00:13:03.938
GuysG One thing. 
From tomorrow on we may have some coke.

225
00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:07.650
Good, man, we'lI make contact and Bljad.

226
00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:08.318
Alright.

227
00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:10.320
What? Really?

228
00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:11.821
Take a look.

229
00:14:15.594 --> 00:14:18.221
Memo, have you burned down the building, dude?

230
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:20.682
What are you talking about?

231
00:14:21.433 --> 00:14:22.684
I'm hungry, man.

232
00:14:22.685 --> 00:14:25.061
Here, 5 stars á la carte.

233
00:14:27.147 --> 00:14:28.356
What's this crap, dude?

234
00:14:29.859 --> 00:14:30.984
Are you kidding me?

235
00:14:31.402 --> 00:14:32.527
This is completely burned down.

236
00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:36.281
What are you talking about? 
People pay for this!

237
00:14:36.407 --> 00:14:37.323
Really?

238
00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:37.991
Yeah!

239
00:14:37.992 --> 00:14:40.660
I wanna see these guys.
Do you at least have some bread or something like that here?


240
00:14:47.209 --> 00:14:48.167
Another one.

241
00:14:49.295 --> 00:14:50.336
Thanks.

242
00:15:02.683 --> 00:15:04.517
No one pays anything for this shitn man.

243
00:15:06.437 --> 00:15:08.563
You know what Apon you're fucking with me!

244
00:15:08.564 --> 00:15:13.026
No kidding, completely burned down. Amateur.

245
00:15:13.027 --> 00:15:14.485
You're fucking with me, digger!

246
00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:17.989
Your food is crap, man.
You know what?


247
00:15:18.157 --> 00:15:22.660
l pull a head.
You can eat this shit yourself.


248
00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:25.288
Give me one too.

249
00:15:26.457 --> 00:15:28.291
That's how I like you, kanak.

250
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:43.723
Hey.

251
00:15:45.267 --> 00:15:46.351
What's the matter.

252
00:15:46.352 --> 00:15:46.976
Door.

253
00:15:48.687 --> 00:15:51.898
What do I care? You idiot.

254
00:16:03.577 --> 00:16:04.285
You jerk.

255
00:16:08.999 --> 00:16:12.251
Aight, aight, aight.

256
00:16:17.132 --> 00:16:19.592
What's up?
Everything's good?


257
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.096
Comen we have plans for today, bro.

258
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:29.185
How's it going Mio?

259
00:16:29.186 --> 00:16:31.521
What's up you little cokes?
Everything's good boys?


260
00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:35.274
Ejjjj, what kind of kurac is this, Picku materinu, dude?!
What's that dude?


261
00:16:35.442 --> 00:16:37.318
Can't you work properly here guys?!

262
00:16:39.822 --> 00:16:41.906
They sold Sneijder.

263
00:16:42.908 --> 00:16:45.618
What are you meaning with selling?
They've gunned him down, just like that.


264
00:16:46.704 --> 00:16:47.787
And who have we go now?

265
00:16:47.997 --> 00:16:50.790
Berando or something like that. 
He's quite the cheap wanker.

266
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:53.001
You can't compare Belanger with Sneijder.

267
00:16:53.002 --> 00:16:53.751
Never!

268
00:16:53.836 --> 00:16:54.961
You've got no money, man.

269
00:16:55.045 --> 00:16:57.672
What are you talking about?
They've almost sold half of Istanbul.


270
00:16:57.756 --> 00:16:58.923
And what did you do with that?

271
00:16:59.008 --> 00:17:00.800
Everything Tschukas Amonakoim.

272
00:17:02.094 --> 00:17:04.387
Thieves, Amonakuim, that's football.

273
00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:07.306
This has nothing to do with football.

274
00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.852
Absolutely not.
You see Belange at UFA in the preliminary round ...


275
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.856
I swear we're everywhere disgraced now.
This isn't normal anymore.


276
00:17:15.107 --> 00:17:16.983
Wait, there is nothing,we will come together.

277
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:20.278
What do you want with your Travlon, dude.
You're our brother, lan.


278
00:17:20.612 --> 00:17:22.572
Sneijderwas also like that previously.

279
00:17:23.657 --> 00:17:25.158
But that's something we just selln you know.

280
00:17:25.159 --> 00:17:29.912
How can you buy Belanger? 
He can never replace him.

281
00:17:33.584 --> 00:17:40.465
Lukas is gone too ... Podolski.
What else do you want there, dude?G That's no more ... You


282
00:17:40.632 --> 00:17:44.677
can't do this anymore man.
The president has to go.


283
00:17:44.678 --> 00:17:45.470
Bastards.

284
00:17:46.889 --> 00:17:50.141
Hey, stop with this football rubbish!
What's the matter?


285
00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:53.436
We've got other problems.
What's with this damn Müller?


286
00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:56.147
This lawyern did he bring the documents?

287
00:17:56.315 --> 00:17:58.858
We haven't got anything yet. 
I even call him a few times.

288
00:17:59.109 --> 00:17:59.650
Yes?

289
00:17:59.818 --> 00:18:02.278
He doesn't answer his phone.
I was in his council.


290
00:18:02.488 --> 00:18:04.906
lt's closed.
I don't know what to do anymore.


291
00:18:05.282 --> 00:18:10.286
Dude, I have to find out, whether this damn wanker did
some statements, this Mustafa.


292
00:18:10.579 --> 00:18:13.706
I'd be careful with this guy.
He is dangerous.


293
00:18:13.874 --> 00:18:17.418
I think he'll be telling a lot.
He's a real rat.


294
00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:20.797
Call him, every day.
Okay? Otherwise he should move his ass here.


295
00:18:20.964 --> 00:18:22.799
We're not paying him for nothing.

296
00:18:23.634 --> 00:18:24.801
Should I visit him at home?

297
00:18:24.802 --> 00:18:26.010
Of course.

298
00:18:27.971 --> 00:18:29.972
Why haven't we got the documents yet?

299
00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:32.850
I'll go visit him tomorrow.

300
00:18:33.769 --> 00:18:36.479
I swear.
Dude, I'm really doing something for you.


301
00:18:36.647 --> 00:18:40.942
I've got some really good stuff for you guys.
And CENK is coming afterwards.


302
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.236
He'll be bringing really good coke.

303
00:18:43.237 --> 00:18:43.986
Yeah, man ...

304
00:18:43.987 --> 00:18:48.074
Then we can give it really hard to us tonight, guys.
Really awesome.


305
00:18:48.242 --> 00:18:50.952
Here boys.
Take a look, check this out, dudes.


306
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.078
Really great!

307
00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:53.538
Awesome, huh?

308
00:18:53.997 --> 00:18:56.374
And how are you going? All cool?

309
00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:57.375
Of course man.

310
00:18:57.584 --> 00:19:00.795
Great! That's how it's supposed to go.

311
00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:02.547
Awesome.

312
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.631
Tell me!

313
00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:07.760
Dude, it's been a rough day.
Going here and there.


314
00:19:07.928 --> 00:19:10.721
Working, get some stuff.
Meet up with Cenk.


315
00:19:10.889 --> 00:19:14.225
Now it's running.
He should be there soon to, guys.


316
00:19:14.393 --> 00:19:16.811
And then we can really have fun.

317
00:19:17.062 --> 00:19:19.021
You wanna smoke some bong?

318
00:19:20.232 --> 00:19:21.357
No bad idea, bro.

319
00:19:23.402 --> 00:19:25.361
Come, I'll fill you up.

320
00:19:27.823 --> 00:19:29.907
How are you. Everything's cool?

321
00:19:29.908 --> 00:19:30.408
Yo.

322
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:31.325
Are you good?

323
00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:31.951
Yeah.

324
00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:33.578
Haa, you little pitckis.

325
00:19:34.454 --> 00:19:35.413
Crazy guys.

326
00:19:35.873 --> 00:19:37.707
Have a shot, brother.

327
00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:41.460
Who's coming here?

328
00:19:41.879 --> 00:19:43.462
Cenkn Cenk is coming, bro.

329
00:19:43.463 --> 00:19:46.465
Father Christmasn dude, with snow!

330
00:19:46.466 --> 00:19:47.216
Awseome!

331
00:19:47.843 --> 00:19:50.261
Father Christmas comes, with the snow.

332
00:19:51.305 --> 00:20:01.305
All these damn Shisha Bars and lute shops are opening here
and no one comes to mind to pay here something.


333
00:20:01.481 --> 00:20:04.108
Give me the mobile phones.

334
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:06.027
Put them all here.

335
00:20:06.236 --> 00:20:07.278
Tolga!

336
00:20:08.488 --> 00:20:11.240
Come here. Get these things out of here.

337
00:20:16.622 --> 00:20:19.123
Our brothers are in prison.
The families, ok?


338
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:23.211
The women and children.
All this weighs heavily on my back, guys.


339
00:20:23.462 --> 00:20:27.298
On you too.
Okay? It's time that we go back to these damn shops, these


340
00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:30.801
shisha bars as well.
Take them with you too, all of them.


341
00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:34.472
Thousand euros a month at least, okay?
They should donate us.


342
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.392
But do it politely.
You go in there, it would be best if you take


343
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.353
Ali and his boys as well ...

344
00:20:40.354 --> 00:20:40.728
Okay.

345
00:20:40.729 --> 00:20:42.855
Okay?
Go in there, politely.


346
00:20:43.023 --> 00:20:48.110
Tell him exactly that.
We have brothers that are in prison, ok?


347
00:20:48.278 --> 00:20:51.447
And they have families and children.

348
00:20:52.491 --> 00:20:59.705
This means we would like to have some support, a donation.
Whatever you want to call it, ok?


349
00:20:59.873 --> 00:21:02.625
If they'll give itn that's great.

350
00:21:02.918 --> 00:21:04.168
And what if not?

351
00:21:05.754 --> 00:21:07.922
Then you know what to do, man!

352
00:21:12.261 --> 00:21:15.263
Look around there are quite a lot.
Go to the managers and resolve this.


353
00:21:15.514 --> 00:21:16.597
The all have gotten so brash ...

354
00:21:16.598 --> 00:21:18.683
What is this crap?

355
00:21:18.684 --> 00:21:20.142
They are earning quite a lot.

356
00:21:20.852 --> 00:21:21.978
Go take care of that.

357
00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:29.151
Whaiiii, Cenk!

358
00:21:29.152 --> 00:21:33.447
Shhht! What's up, what's up brother?

359
00:21:33.448 --> 00:21:33.823
Hey!

360
00:21:33.824 --> 00:21:34.699
What's up? Everything fresh?

361
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.157
Hey, Brother, all good?

362
00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:37.076
How are you bro? 
Everything's fresh?

363
00:21:37.077 --> 00:21:37.535
Yeah, man

364
00:21:37.536 --> 00:21:42.206
Look what I brought you guy.
Daddy brought something for you.


365
00:21:43.041 --> 00:21:46.252
50 G, best material, directly from columbia, brothers.

366
00:21:46.253 --> 00:21:46.752
Yeah, nice!

367
00:21:46.753 --> 00:21:47.795
Jackpot!

368
00:21:47.796 --> 00:21:50.965
We gotta prepare everything right away.
Don't talk so much, here let's have a drink.


369
00:21:51.133 --> 00:21:52.133
Fill something up for me.

370
00:21:52.509 --> 00:21:55.261
Buddy, where's the plate?
We gotta prepare!


371
00:21:55.429 --> 00:22:01.309
Make space, it looks really messy here again.
Guys, honestly, ej, you're really messy.


372
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.977
Yes, yes. Drink, drink, drink, come down.

373
00:22:02.978 --> 00:22:04.061
Let's prepare a line right away.

374
00:22:05.731 --> 00:22:09.358
What's the matter with your cango? 
He's really down too.

375
00:22:10.027 --> 00:22:10.818
Yeah, Memo.

376
00:22:10.902 --> 00:22:15.573
Yes, he's also just hanging around with junkies.
He's getting one too.


377
00:22:16.408 --> 00:22:19.243
He wasn't like that man.
He's a good boy.


378
00:22:19.411 --> 00:22:22.913
The mother has died
- my step mother-in-law ...

379
00:22:24.624 --> 00:22:29.628
It's always the good ones, you know.
Always the good one have to go early.


380
00:22:29.796 --> 00:22:34.091
The father has gone crazy and is gone.
He is gone to Turkey.


381
00:22:34.593 --> 00:22:39.305
My Wife is screwed and
the little bratn he ...

382
00:22:39.681 --> 00:22:40.890
Is it that bad?

383
00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:44.226
Yeah, he is really down man.
He is just hanging around with junkies man.


384
00:22:44.394 --> 00:22:45.353
We gotta watch out.

385
00:22:45.604 --> 00:22:47.146
He goes through a lot. 
He wasn't like that.

386
00:22:47.522 --> 00:22:48.981
They turn him into a victim.

387
00:22:49.858 --> 00:22:52.693
And if we bring him to
us to hang out with us?

388
00:22:53.028 --> 00:22:53.611
Yes.

389
00:22:54.488 --> 00:22:55.988
So we can keep an eye on him.

390
00:22:55.989 --> 00:22:59.200
Yes, do that!
This is really pissing me off!


391
00:22:59.368 --> 00:23:04.288
I ... You know, I can't take it if he's
crashing down as well.


392
00:23:04.498 --> 00:23:07.208
But he won't listen to us. 
You have to talk to him.

393
00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:09.043
He'll be okay with that, man.

394
00:23:13.423 --> 00:23:20.137
If he is in here, we can have an eye on him but if he's out
there, you know exactly that we can't watch out for him.


395
00:23:21.223 --> 00:23:25.393
Yes, we have to do that ... 
Holy crap, man.

396
00:23:25.977 --> 00:23:29.647
You again, you again. 
It's always you.

397
00:23:33.568 --> 00:23:35.653
You can't sell it easily. 
You have to try it first.

398
00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:38.656
Yes, you have to.

399
00:23:42.494 --> 00:23:45.538
Ooooh, this is looking
good, this is looking good!

400
00:23:46.248 --> 00:23:50.126
This is not just looking good, this is the best stuff, bro.
It's the best stuff in the whole city.


401
00:23:50.127 --> 00:23:54.797
This looks like columbia brother! 
This looks like Columbia.

402
00:23:55.424 --> 00:23:58.884
So boy.
You can maybe light on the bong, buddy.


403
00:23:59.052 --> 00:24:02.763
So you have something to do too?
Get down a little.


404
00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:05.433
Before things get high for you.

405
00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:06.350
Ej, great.

406
00:24:07.644 --> 00:24:09.353
Let daddy take the first turn.

407
00:24:12.774 --> 00:24:13.732
So boys ...

408
00:24:13.859 --> 00:24:17.987
Boys, hey hey. 
We have one week. 50G, 70 Euro per gram, ok?

409
00:24:17.988 --> 00:24:18.446
Yeah man.

410
00:24:18.447 --> 00:24:19.488
Then we can make good money.

411
00:24:19.489 --> 00:24:19.905
Yeah man.

412
00:24:19.906 --> 00:24:20.448
Ok?

413
00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:23.367
Super. Sounds great.

414
00:24:26.037 --> 00:24:26.996
Gimme, gimme!

415
00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:28.998
You want to have a drink?

416
00:24:34.796 --> 00:24:35.838
Gimme, gimme!

417
00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:39.675
Mio, get everything ready. 
You're the expert.

418
00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:40.676
It's all good, it's all good.

419
00:24:41.052 --> 00:24:41.469
Ok?

420
00:24:43.263 --> 00:24:45.598
So guys, and now we stretch it.

421
00:26:10.058 --> 00:26:12.351
Bro, man.
What do you want with the the coke?


422
00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:13.561
I just wanted dope.

423
00:26:14.104 --> 00:26:15.646
You're potheads, aren't you?

424
00:26:16.523 --> 00:26:17.356
Yeah man.

425
00:26:17.357 --> 00:26:19.108
So, did you try cocaine before?

426
00:26:19.109 --> 00:26:20.276
No man, never.

427
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.029
Then pay attention.
This is gonna make you down.


428
00:26:24.197 --> 00:26:27.283
This is going to turn
you into a superhero, a superman.

429
00:26:27.284 --> 00:26:28.242
Can I take a look?

430
00:26:28.243 --> 00:26:33.497
Yeah, sure but be careful. 
This is worth 100 Euros ...

431
00:26:33.498 --> 00:26:36.166
Dude, I just wanted dope, man. 
We have no money well.

432
00:26:36.167 --> 00:26:36.625
Digger ...

433
00:26:36.626 --> 00:26:37.793
How much does it coest anyway?

434
00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:41.630
This normally costs ... 1
50 Euros, for you it's 100.

435
00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:43.132
How much have you got with you?

436
00:26:44.301 --> 00:26:45.426
Hey guys ...

437
00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:47.720
Hey guys, man you

00:26:48.847 --> 00:26:49.513

440

Hey guys, are you really sure, man?

441
00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:52.641

442
00:26:53.643 --> 00:26:55.561
I have 30 for you too.

443
00:27:03.528 --> 00:27:04.278
I only have coins.

444
00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:05.237
What should I do with this crap?

445
00:27:05.238 --> 00:27:07.156
Yeah, take it, man. 
I don't know, what am I supposed to do?

446
00:27:07.157 --> 00:27:11.660
Give me that, come. 
Have fun with it boys.

447
00:27:12.287 --> 00:27:12.870
Thanks man.

448
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:14.246
What are we supposed
to do with that, dude?

449
00:27:14.247 --> 00:27:18.334
You're splitting it up. 1 , 2, 3, 4.
Four lines with the nose.


450
00:27:18.877 --> 00:27:20.252
With a bill or how?

451
00:27:20.253 --> 00:27:21.962
Yes, you'll find a five
euro bill somewhere for sure.

452
00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:24.548
Alright, thank you.

453
00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:26.342
Guys, guys. Is this good?

454
00:27:44.527 --> 00:27:45.486
Heeey baby.

455
00:27:45.487 --> 00:27:46.945
Hey Jessy, sweety. 
Everything fresh?

456
00:27:46.946 --> 00:27:47.988
All good. How are you?

457
00:27:47.989 --> 00:27:48.781
I'm fine and you?

458
00:27:48.782 --> 00:27:49.531
Good, very good.

459
00:27:49.532 --> 00:27:50.366
You're looking good.

460
00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:51.325
Thank you, you too. Take a seat.

461
00:27:54.579 --> 00:27:55.412
Take a seat.

462
00:27:55.413 --> 00:27:57.081
It's warm here. 
What are you doing?

463
00:27:57.082 --> 00:27:58.791
You can take off yourjacket right here.

464
00:27:58.792 --> 00:28:00.668
Really? How are things going?

465
00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:04.088
It's all going really crappy.

466
00:28:04.089 --> 00:28:09.802
I don't know how I should manage all this.
My friends keeps telling me "Come, get your nails done".


467
00:28:09.969 --> 00:28:10.678
But 30 euro

468
00:28:10.679 --> 00:28:13.555
Nail studio?
With faked nails I can't even fold the


469
00:28:13.723 --> 00:28:15.516
sockets of my bike together.

470
00:28:15.517 --> 00:28:15.933
Ok ...

471
00:28:15.934 --> 00:28:20.938
I have no more fresh diapers, the bed is broken, I have no
cash from the job centre ... But the best thing is that I


472
00:28:21.106 --> 00:28:23.607
got fired.
Now I have to look out for something anyway.


473
00:28:23.608 --> 00:28:24.817
What kind of bullshit are you doing, really?

474
00:28:24.818 --> 00:28:28.070
Yes, why are you saying that it's my bullshit?
Hey come babyn I am so down.


475
00:28:28.238 --> 00:28:28.946
Make me happy.

476
00:28:28.947 --> 00:28:31.615
Yeah, what can I do for you? Tell me. 
What do you want?

477
00:28:31.616 --> 00:28:33.492
You do know how to make women happy.

478
00:28:33.493 --> 00:28:34.118
Really?

479
00:28:35.036 --> 00:28:39.581
I think I've got something for you here.
Really good stuff.


480
00:28:39.749 --> 00:28:43.127
Look I need a card.
How much do you need?


481
00:28:43.545 --> 00:28:45.254
Baby, as much as possible!

482
00:28:46.423 --> 00:28:47.256
And this means?

483
00:28:47.257 --> 00:28:51.802
Well, I can't pay right now but you know
you'll get it from me.


484
00:28:53.763 --> 00:28:54.680
You're kidding me, are you?

485
00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:55.431
Wait.

486
00:28:55.432 --> 00:28:59.268
No way I'm giving you for IOU ! No, I don't care.
What do you think ...


487
00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:00.853
Wait, just be quiet now. Ok, baby?

488
00:29:00.854 --> 00:29:02.980
Now listen to me.
How do you think this going now?


489
00:29:03.148 --> 00:29:05.482
If I have to go
everywhere to collect the money ...

490
00:29:05.483 --> 00:29:06.191
I understand ...

491
00:29:06.192 --> 00:29:06.984
Am I the social office?

492
00:29:06.985 --> 00:29:07.651
I know ...

493
00:29:07.652 --> 00:29:08.152
So ...

494
00:29:08.153 --> 00:29:08.569
Baby ...

495
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:09.027
This doesn't work.

496
00:29:09.028 --> 00:29:10.237
I can ... Look at me.

497
00:29:10.238 --> 00:29:10.738
What?

498
00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:12.156
I can also pay differently.

499
00:29:12.449 --> 00:29:12.906
And how?

500
00:29:15.076 --> 00:29:15.743
You know how.

501
00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:17.202
Yes, ok.

00:29:36.139 --> 00:29:38.640
Baby come on. You make me happy,

508
00:29:38.641 --> 00:29:39.558
Ok, then here it goes.

But you may not be so loudn ok?

510

Since you're in Germany.

Killer shit.
Do you have some weed for me here?


614
00:34:34.729 --> 00:34:36.980
Because I don't have anything anymore.

615
00:34:39.358 --> 00:34:43.278
Can you then give me a bit from that? 
Shall we trade?

616

This stuff is from Cenk anyway, fuck it, dude.

00:35:20.733 --> 00:35:22.776
Your shit is always good, bro.

628
00:35:22.777 --> 00:35:24.027
You know brother, directly ...

629
00:35:24.028 --> 00:35:25.070
I can't say anything to day, man.

630
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:26.738
This is like straight from Africa.

631
00:35:26.739 --> 00:35:30.283
And what do you say to the coke?
Are you feeling it now how it slowly works?


632
00:35:31.244 --> 00:35:37.040
Bro, if I'm honest. 
Our stuff's bettern you know that.

633
00:35:37.041 --> 00:35:39.126
Buddy, we already traded. 
There is no giving-back.

634
00:35:41.921 --> 00:35:43.797
You do have some more, have you?

635
00:35:43.798 --> 00:35:46.716
If you need it, just say it, buddy.
I'm always ready.


636
00:35:46.884 --> 00:35:47.342
Always!

637
00:35:48.261 --> 00:35:49.803
I trust you, brother.

638
00:35:49.804 --> 00:35:50.762
No problem, bro.

639
00:35:54.058 --> 00:35:55.100
Everyone's smoking nowadays.

640
00:35:57.562 --> 00:36:00.981
But you know what?
Before I leave now, come let's do a line.


641
00:36:01.149 --> 00:36:04.067
I don't have anything left.
I gave you the rest.


642
00:36:04.068 --> 00:36:07.821
Bro, you gave me the rest.
What is then there for me to keep?


643
00:36:08.656 --> 00:36:10.866
This is still enough.
Come onn we can still do one line.


644
00:36:11.033 --> 00:36:12.117
Don't be so stingy, man.

645
00:36:12.118 --> 00:36:15.370
lt's always, always like this.
Why are you always doing this to me?


646
00:36:15.371 --> 00:36:18.582
The German State is generous with you too.
Come on, let's do a line, bro.


647
00:36:18.583 --> 00:36:19.875
Ahhhh, this politics, hm?

648
00:36:19.876 --> 00:36:23.920
I can build one with the dope from you too.
Then we are even again.


649
00:36:24.463 --> 00:36:25.213
Ok, brother.

650
00:36:25.214 --> 00:36:27.382
You lay on, I build one, everything's cool.

651
00:36:32.763 --> 00:36:35.807
Did you hear that, kanaks? 
Gay people may marry now.

652
00:36:35.808 --> 00:36:37.142
Yes, man, I heard that too.

653
00:36:37.143 --> 00:36:40.562
What are you saying to that Memo? 
As the gaylord?

654
00:36:41.564 --> 00:36:44.608
As president of the gay
I always stand behind you man.

Amonakuim you pic, dude.
Imagine yourselfn that you'd be adopted, dude.


656
00:36:50.198 --> 00:36:52.032

657
00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:52.490
Yeah man.

658
00:36:52.491 --> 00:36:53.366
With so big tits?

659
00:36:53.659 --> 00:36:55.410
Your porn world, dude.

660
00:36:55.411 --> 00:36:56.578
That would be sweet.

661
00:36:56.579 --> 00:36:58.330
You wouldn't need to watch porn anymore, kanak.

662
00:36:58.873 --> 00:36:59.915
Yeah man!

663

00:37:06.047 --> 00:37:07.339
Who's that now, brother?

665
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.381
Do you have visit?

666
00:37:08.716 --> 00:37:09.716
Straight visit.

667
00:37:18.726 --> 00:37:21.686
In the meanwhile ... In the meanwhile
we make ourselves useful.


668
00:37:25.107 --> 00:37:28.318
Boys, a little visit is here.

669
00:37:28.819 --> 00:37:31.571
Merhaba.

670
00:37:31.572 --> 00:37:32.072
Toby.

671
00:37:32.073 --> 00:37:33.365
Apo, what's up kanak?

672
00:37:33.366 --> 00:37:33.907
Toby.

673
00:37:34.367 --> 00:37:34.950
Mio.

674
00:37:35.826 --> 00:37:36.868
What are you up to?

675
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.328
all good, Harry Potter?

676
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:39.287
Everything's fine and cool.

677
00:37:39.622 --> 00:37:41.665
I would check out
some coke, you got something?

678
00:37:41.999 --> 00:37:42.958
Cocaine.

679
00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:44.918
You want coke? 
Do you even have money with you?

680
00:37:45.795 --> 00:37:49.381
Do I not look like that? 400. 
Incomprehensible.

681
00:37:49.382 --> 00:37:54.636
400? Well this doesn't look that bad what this Harry Potter
is conjuring up here.


682
00:37:54.845 --> 00:37:56.721
Alright, wait a little bit.

683
00:38:03.896 --> 00:38:05.313
Potter, where are you coming from?

684
00:38:05.314 --> 00:38:06.273
Stuttgart.

685
00:38:06.274 --> 00:38:07.274
Stuttgart?

686
00:38:07.817 --> 00:38:09.317
Bad Cannstatt, to be precise.

687
00:38:09.318 --> 00:38:10.360
Nice.

688
00:38:23.374 --> 00:38:25.458
You already in the
cocaine business since a while?

689
00:38:26.127 --> 00:38:27.127
Just a few months.

690
00:38:27.545 --> 00:38:29.296
Ey, a newcomer.

691
00:38:29.297 --> 00:38:30.588
Here my friendn here you go.

692
00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:36.678
Isn't this a little bit
too short for 400 euros?

693
00:38:36.679 --> 00:38:39.431
Too short?
Be happyn that you get something in the first place, dude.


694
00:38:39.432 --> 00:38:42.475
This is top material. Columbia.

695
00:38:42.476 --> 00:38:43.977
This is the best of the best, dude.

696
00:38:43.978 --> 00:38:45.020
I hope so.

697
00:38:45.021 --> 00:38:46.813
You're getting top quality from us.

698
00:38:46.814 --> 00:38:49.149
Come one, just smoke on. 
Nicely put it in the mouth.

699
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.191
Thanks, bro.

700
00:38:52.320 --> 00:39:00.327
Yo, give it Potter, this takes you straight to Hogwarts!
Apo Airlines mix.


701
00:39:00.494 --> 00:39:03.371
Dude, you kids, you kids.

Thanks!

704
00:39:14.175 --> 00:39:15.175
What was that?

705
00:39:15.176 --> 00:39:15.216
What was that?
This was the spitting glass, dude.


706
00:39:15.217 --> 00:39:16.593
This was the spitting glass, dude.

707
00:39:32.777 --> 00:39:35.737
Come on, breath!
Get the hands up, hands up!

Come boy, what is that?

You're fighting soon, not me!
Come on, boyn what is this?


710
00:39:43.496 --> 00:39:48.583
You don't breathe, you don't even carry your feet with you.
What is that, what's the matter with you?


711
00:39:48.584 --> 00:39:49.542
Ok, come do it again.

712
00:39:49.543 --> 00:39:50.919
You're hanging around with your friends.
They're bad.


713
00:39:51.087 --> 00:39:52.212
At this rate, you're not getting far.

714
00:39:52.505 --> 00:39:54.005
Come again Aziz, come!

715
00:39:56.217 --> 00:39:58.259
Come and breathe.
Cenk, cenk please.


716
00:39:58.469 --> 00:40:01.513
You're not even using your feet.
What's up with you?


717
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.725
You hang around with yourjunkie friends,
fucking all weekend.


718
00:40:05.726 --> 00:40:10.146
You're not even running in the weekend.
You're not going Juma namaz too.


719
00:40:10.314 --> 00:40:13.525
What is this?
Now you're taking out shoes and gloves.


720
00:40:13.734 --> 00:40:16.361
Now you can go away againn like always!

721
00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:22.826
What's the matter?
Yes, always hand now, right?


722
00:40:22.993 --> 00:40:28.832
Yes, pack your things and go ! Think
about everything you want.


723
00:40:29.542 --> 00:40:33.253
Hey Potter, are you alright? 
Are you in Hogwarts?

724
00:40:33.254 --> 00:40:34.254
What?

725
00:40:34.255 --> 00:40:40.760
Did Apo Airlines fuck you?
Hey Mion lay a nose for him so the kanak is alright again.


726
00:40:41.387 --> 00:40:43.096
Really, this just had to be.

727
00:40:43.097 --> 00:40:44.973
Hey, hey, aren't you the ex of Sarah?

728
00:40:44.974 --> 00:40:46.391
How do you know her?

729
00:40:46.392 --> 00:40:47.392
I don't know her.

730
00:40:47.393 --> 00:40:49.936
Then why is she
coming to your mind? Hm?

731
00:40:49.937 --> 00:40:54.983
A colleague from work talked about her, how he fucks
her and that it's the ex of Mio.


732
00:40:54.984 --> 00:40:56.901
What?
What did he say?! Who fucks my ex, dude?


733
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:58.987
Hm?, Who?

Tell me now who said that, dude ! Right

I tell you everything man!

736
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:18.298
Hey, what's up? 
Is everything good?

737
00:41:18.299 --> 00:41:19.299
Everything's great.

738
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.341
You're this Cenk, aren't you?

739
00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:22.260
Yes. I am.

740
00:41:23.721 --> 00:41:25.346
Dude, you're completely fucked up, man.

741
00:41:26.223 --> 00:41:27.348
I'm alright.

742
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:29.142
Yes, I just saw that up heren hm.

743
00:41:29.143 --> 00:41:30.143
I'm alright.

744
00:41:30.853 --> 00:41:35.231
Calm down, hm. Are you high?

745
00:41:36.108 --> 00:41:37.150
Yes, bro.

746
00:41:37.151 --> 00:41:38.276
Yes, man, I see it.

747
00:41:43.908 --> 00:41:44.866
Do you want some?

748
00:41:44.867 --> 00:41:45.825
Do you have something here?

749
00:41:45.826 --> 00:41:46.868
Always.

750
00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:47.827
Can you show me?

751
00:41:48.662 --> 00:41:49.621
I've got the best stuff.

752
00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:50.997
Let me have a taste. Okay.

753
00:42:06.514 --> 00:42:08.681
And? Brutal, hm?

754
00:42:08.682 --> 00:42:11.726
Great, Do you have more of that?

755
00:42:12.311 --> 00:42:13.728
As much as you want.

756
00:42:13.729 --> 00:42:14.395
Yes?

757
00:42:14.396 --> 00:42:15.438
Yes !

758
00:42:16.023 --> 00:42:20.610
Is that alright, 50G for 70 Euro? 
Can you organise that?

759
00:42:20.945 --> 00:42:22.820
But then really 50G, hm?

760
00:42:23.364 --> 00:42:24.364
50G.

761
00:42:24.782 --> 00:42:30.578
Okay, But let us agree to a meeting point right now.
Because I don't want to talk anything over telephone.


762
00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:33.831
No, no, no, oh God.
How about tomorrow, about 1 6 - 1 7 o'clock?


763
00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:35.250
Is this good for you?

764
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.043
1 7 o' clock!

765
00:42:37.044 --> 00:42:37.544
Yes.

766
00:42:37.545 --> 00:42:38.545
At the student residence.

767
00:42:38.546 --> 00:42:39.420
Ok, alright.

768
00:42:39.421 --> 00:42:39.921
Ok?

769
00:42:39.922 --> 00:42:40.713
Great, I'll come.

770
00:42:40.714 --> 00:42:41.673
You know where?

771
00:42:42.466 --> 00:42:42.674
Ok.

772
00:42:42.675 --> 00:42:43.383
Don't worry.

773
00:42:44.677 --> 00:42:48.638
Tomorrow ... 5 pm.
I got a little question.


774
00:42:48.806 --> 00:42:50.890
What are you working?

775
00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:53.685
Oh you really want to
know that? I'm a banker.

776
00:42:56.146 --> 00:42:58.565
Give me my gloves, banker.

777
00:42:58.566 --> 00:43:00.316
You wanted to reject me.

778
00:43:00.317 --> 00:43:03.486
I wanted to take my gloves with me.
Awesome, Bro ! It was a pleasure to me.


779
00:43:03.487 --> 00:43:04.237
Until tomorrow.

780
00:43:04.238 --> 00:43:05.280
Ciao.

781
00:43:06.407 --> 00:43:10.577
You know what Apo brother, this little slut man.
She's fucking around already with some random guys.


782
00:43:10.744 --> 00:43:13.913
Ey, I could really vomit, man.
You know, I'm going to fuck this bastard.


783
00:43:13.914 --> 00:43:16.332
Just screw this potato whore, man.
This was obvious.


784
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.167
What do you want with an German?

785
00:43:18.168 --> 00:43:19.002
Yeah, bro, you know ...

786
00:43:19.003 --> 00:43:19.836
Fuck this whore!

787
00:43:19.837 --> 00:43:23.089
I don't think such things at that time.
But she wasn't even the problem. she was cool.


788
00:43:23.257 --> 00:43:25.592
Then suddenly the parents, bla bla, bla und talk her out of
it.


789
00:43:25.759 --> 00:43:27.051
You know, they never liked me.

790
00:43:27.052 --> 00:43:28.970
They never liked me.
They always told her to go away from me.


791
00:43:29.138 --> 00:43:30.221
What do you want from him?
You know.


792
00:43:30.389 --> 00:43:31.222
Absolutely disgusting.

793
00:43:31.223 --> 00:43:33.766
Forget this bitch, dude!
Now let's just fuck this son of a bitch.


794
00:43:33.767 --> 00:43:37.937
Yeah, this bastard really deserved it, man.
And then he talks all big about that he fucked my ex.


795
00:43:37.938 --> 00:43:40.148
He knows, that it's your
ex and he's fucking her.

796
00:43:40.149 --> 00:43:42.483
He's going to see something, man. 
He'll see it man.

797
00:43:42.484 --> 00:43:43.651
You have to defend your reputation Mio!

798
00:43:43.652 --> 00:43:44.652
Yes, absolutely.

799
00:43:44.653 --> 00:43:46.738
Do you allow this little
wanker to have his fun?

800
00:43:46.739 --> 00:43:49.157
We're gonna take this little bastard on now.
This little slut.


801
00:43:49.742 --> 00:43:52.535
Mio, we have to be quiet, so the
motherfucker isn't hearing us.


802
00:43:52.536 --> 00:43:54.787
Yes, you're absolutely right, brother.

803
00:43:54.788 --> 00:43:55.830
Wait a little bit.

804
00:43:55.831 --> 00:43:56.831
You know, normally ...

805
00:43:57.541 --> 00:43:58.541
First let us pull one.

806
00:43:58.542 --> 00:44:00.918

Hold him tight.

I know.

857
00:48:13.922 --> 00:48:16.966
If this stuff tastes well, do you think we could do
something like that more often?


858
00:48:17.134 --> 00:48:17.800
Like every week?

859
00:48:19.386 --> 00:48:22.096
Always. You can come always.

860
00:48:22.097 --> 00:48:24.223
Yes? Because that would be great, right now there's nothing
to find anywhere.


861
00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:26.392
We never get our hands on something.
And we need this every week!


862
00:48:26.393 --> 00:48:29.103
No one else has got such
bad ass stuff like me too.

863
00:48:29.104 --> 00:48:31.147
Hmm, we'll see that then.

899
00:50:27.139 --> 00:50:28.139
What's the matter?

900
00:50:28.974 --> 00:50:29.932
I had to go to the doctor today.

901
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:32.268
Why?

902
00:50:32.894 --> 00:50:34.729
Because I'm sick. Mentally.

903
00:50:35.564 --> 00:50:36.564
Nice.

904
00:50:36.565 --> 00:50:41.235
No man, the employment exchange sent me a letter, these
motherfuckers want me to turn up there.


905
00:50:41.403 --> 00:50:44.613
I don't want to go there.
You know these motherfuckers, right?


906
00:50:45.198 --> 00:50:46.240
Yees.

907

So they won't cut my services, I'll send them
my notification of illness.

And you're saving my ass with the coke.

911
00:50:54.791 --> 00:50:56.751
Always a pleasure. Any time.

912
00:50:56.835 --> 00:50:57.835
Ahhhh, fuck.

916
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:06.343
What's wrong with you Cenk?

917
00:51:06.928 --> 00:51:09.096
What are you talking brother?
He just got out yesterday. You have no idea.


918
00:51:09.181 --> 00:51:10.097

929
00:51:23.361 --> 00:51:28.532
Ble comes out ... and the Alban is back on board.
Then we'll have Shanire Montiran again.


930
00:51:28.992 --> 00:51:29.950
Hahaha, awesome.

931
00:51:30.494 --> 00:51:31.494
Guys there's weed on it.

932
00:51:32.496 --> 00:51:34.705
That's the best guys. 
No matter, you're neighbours buddy.

Mio, hurry up, buddy.

937
00:51:40.087 --> 00:51:44.173
What can you do beside masturbating?
Sniffing the stuff away.


938
00:51:45.258 --> 00:51:47.093
Think about you while fapping.

939
00:51:47.719 --> 00:51:48.677
You homo.

940
00:51:49.179 --> 00:51:50.137

00:51:52.516 --> 00:51:53.516
Give it to him, dude.

942
00:52:07.656 --> 00:52:10.282
Uh, brother, how are you doing, man?

943
00:52:10.283 --> 00:52:12.243
What's up you damn koxas man?

944
00:52:12.452 --> 00:52:13.410
Everything's fresh?

945
00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:15.037
Ahhhh, Koxa ...

946
00:52:15.247 --> 00:52:18.374
Nice to see you brother, nice to see you man.
Finally you're out here buddy.


947
00:52:18.542 --> 00:52:20.417
Are you alright?
Finally you're here again.


948
00:52:20.877 --> 00:52:21.836
Ohhh, Memo.

949
00:52:22.003 --> 00:52:22.878
Ble.

950
00:52:26.174 --> 00:52:27.007
How is your father?

951
00:52:27.008 --> 00:52:28.050
Good, good.

952
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:28.968
Your family is alright, isn't it?

953
00:52:28.969 --> 00:52:29.468
All good.

954
00:52:29.469 --> 00:52:30.386
Apo!

955
00:52:30.387 --> 00:52:32.638
Hey brother. A free man again. 
I'm happy for you bro.

956
00:52:32.639 --> 00:52:34.765
How are you you fucking Serbian?
Don't you even want to stand up?


957
00:52:34.891 --> 00:52:36.350
What are you talking about fucking Serbian you fucking
Albanian.


958
00:52:36.518 --> 00:52:37.268
What's the matter with you?

959
00:52:37.269 --> 00:52:38.477
Dude, what's wrong brother? Hm?

960
00:52:38.478 --> 00:52:40.271
Don't speak like that you unt.

961
00:52:44.317 --> 00:52:45.651
Nice that you're out, dude.

962
00:52:46.153 --> 00:52:48.571
You damn, You damn.
Do you know what you are?


963
00:52:48.738 --> 00:52:50.281
You're a damn chad nigger.

964
00:52:50.365 --> 00:52:54.910
Ahh, always these Ucekas here, dude. I swear my brother.
Clean bro, good that you're out again buddy.


965
00:52:54.911 --> 00:52:56.996
Hey Blerem. We have
a gift for you bro.

966
00:52:56.997 --> 00:52:57.872
Yeah?

967
00:52:57.873 --> 00:53:02.001
Good cocaine my friend. 
On your freedom, brother.

968
00:53:02.002 --> 00:53:03.043
No, that's nothing for me.

969
00:53:03.044 --> 00:53:03.961
Are you for real?

970
00:53:04.129 --> 00:53:05.421
I've stopped with this shit.

971
00:53:05.547 --> 00:53:07.173
Boys, did you get fucked
in the prison cell? What's wrong?

972
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.051
No, man!

973
00:53:11.052 --> 00:53:15.014
No, this crap ... it changes your personality.
Brothers betray brothers.


974
00:53:15.182 --> 00:53:18.392
Own cousin betrays his cousin dude.
It all doesn't matter.


975
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.061
There is ... It
takes you your honor, man

976
00:53:21.062 --> 00:53:24.481
It changes you.
This shit is not going to take anyone further.


977
00:53:24.649 --> 00:53:28.569
You need to let this shit be.
Believe me mann, Ey I swear you, this is


978
00:53:28.737 --> 00:53:30.362
the worst thing I've done.

979
00:53:30.447 --> 00:53:32.031
I couldn't be there at
the birth of my child.

980
00:53:33.158 --> 00:53:37.453
I was on the run, I wanted to be there.
One of my best friends betrays me, you understand?


981
00:53:37.454 --> 00:53:38.871
Fucked up action.

982
00:53:38.872 --> 00:53:46.253
All this time I was just in custody dude, you understand.
The child, the child is given birth and I sit in custody,


983
00:53:46.421 --> 00:53:47.046
you know.

984
00:53:47.214 --> 00:53:48.422
Lots of 31s brother.

985
00:53:48.673 --> 00:53:51.800
Not only 31s brother, these are ... they all don't have a
face.


986
00:53:51.968 --> 00:53:56.138
They are junkies, dude, you understand?
You can't just .... heyn imagine your father


987
00:53:56.306 --> 00:53:58.098
would see what you're doing now.

988
00:53:58.099 --> 00:53:59.850
Do you think your fatherwould
be okay with that orwhat?

989
00:54:00.227 --> 00:54:01.852
Bro, look at me.

990
00:54:04.064 --> 00:54:08.192
The craziest thing about him anyway is, you know.
At this time, I just say to him "Hey what did your parents


991
00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:11.612
say about those tattoos?
He said to me, "Yeah my mom didn't talk to me for a day.


992
00:54:11.696 --> 00:54:13.239
They've already given up hope, bro.

993
00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.990
Aren't you working in the kindergarten?

994
00:54:14.991 --> 00:54:17.952
No, man, these motherfuckers kicked me out.

995
00:54:17.953 --> 00:54:19.703
How sad, man.
Ey, I tell you one thing man.


996
00:54:19.871 --> 00:54:23.874
This shit isn't going to take anyone any further.
At least you've managed it a little bit, hm?


997
00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:25.960
Normally, they wanted togive me 6 years.

998
00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:29.797
Then I wanted to use paragraph 64, you know.
Act a little bit mentally ill and so on.


999
00:54:29.965 --> 00:54:32.466
And so I got three years, 
I could use paragraph 35.

1000
00:54:32.467 --> 00:54:35.261
You know, the health insurance agreed to this otherwise
the pension insurance probably would have done it.


1001
00:54:35.345 --> 00:54:38.806
And then I could sit one year and had to do this damn
therapy for six months.


1002
00:54:38.974 --> 00:54:42.393
Dude, only with fucking junkies man.
I'm only together with junkies man.


1003
00:54:42.519 --> 00:54:44.270
You hear that, Memo?

1004
00:54:45.272 --> 00:54:46.313
You're no better Junkie man.

1005
00:54:47.649 --> 00:54:49.942
Did you at least have
some cool people in prison?

1006
00:54:49.943 --> 00:54:52.027
Yeah, screw that.
What good is this for me?


1007
00:54:52.195 --> 00:54:55.447
Do you understand what I mean?
I am ... I need to go to my family.


1008
00:54:55.615 --> 00:54:58.993
You understand?
Now I have many things to make up for, you know.


1009
00:54:58.994 --> 00:55:01.996
But bro, you know.
The less the Albo pullsn the more the Jugo gets.


1010
00:55:02.163 --> 00:55:03.622
Hand this over bro, what's up?

1011
00:55:03.623 --> 00:55:04.581
Here you go buddy, pull.

1012
00:55:04.666 --> 00:55:05.582
Always your problems.

1013
00:55:05.583 --> 00:55:09.044
Hey, honestly, this brings me really down again, you know.
To see you like that.


1014
00:55:09.212 --> 00:55:12.631
I'm sorry, you know.
I thought to myself now what are the guys doing and so on.


1015
00:55:12.799 --> 00:55:14.008
What has happened to you?

1016
00:55:14.009 --> 00:55:19.555
You didn't pull before, did you?
Since when do you hang out with those guys?


1017
00:55:21.141 --> 00:55:22.516
Memo is the one above J.

1018
00:55:22.642 --> 00:55:24.727
Since when do you have Memo with you?

1019
00:55:25.103 --> 00:55:26.770
Dude, he was suddenly there.

1020
00:55:27.147 --> 00:55:28.188
He's fitting us, bro.

1021
00:55:28.481 --> 00:55:29.523
The craziest of us all.

1022
00:55:29.607 --> 00:55:32.401
Think about what you're doing brother.
I really mean it.


1023
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:37.990
With these boys I pulled with them before, you understand?
But you can see, where did it take me, dude.


1024
00:55:38.158 --> 00:55:39.408
I was in prison.
And?


1025
00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:41.994
Were you in prison?
No man ! Do you understand what I'm talking about?


1026
00:55:42.162 --> 00:55:44.747
You all didn't write letters to me as well, man,
what's wrong with you?


1027
00:55:45.123 --> 00:55:46.373
I can't write brother.

1028
00:55:46.374 --> 00:55:49.877
I can't write, dude do you understand what l ... Ey, I sit
alone there, thinking every day about, when does a fucking


1029
00:55:50.045 --> 00:55:52.171
letter from you come and no letter from
anyone of you is coming man


1030
00:55:52.172 --> 00:55:54.381
I get letters from the guys I expect it the least,
you understand.


1031
00:55:55.967 --> 00:55:57.343
But we talked every day about you brother.

1032
00:55:57.344 --> 00:55:58.677
Yes, this isn't helping me.

1033
00:55:58.762 --> 00:55:59.803
We prayed every day for you.

1034
00:56:00.597 --> 00:56:04.516
Yes bro, this isn't helping me either.
In custody you could have at least send me some SG, some


1035
00:56:04.684 --> 00:56:06.977
special money or something like that, you understand?

1036
00:56:06.978 --> 00:56:09.313
At least look if
my wife needed anything. Nothing.

1037
00:56:10.732 --> 00:56:12.608
I told you bron
you should send money bro.

1038
00:56:12.692 --> 00:56:14.818
brother. Do I look like I have money?

1039
00:56:14.819 --> 00:56:16.612
But okay, at least you're out again buddy.
That's awesome bro.


1040
00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.364
This is ... this ist
the most important thing bro.

1041
00:56:18.656 --> 00:56:21.867
Boys everything's good, I have to go.
Woman and Child.


1042
00:56:22.035 --> 00:56:27.498
Family is coming and I have to make up for a lot.
Good to see ya again, dude, for real.


1043
00:56:28.291 --> 00:56:29.291
Can we have a little chat, buddy?

1044
00:56:29.376 --> 00:56:30.292
Yes.

1045
00:56:30.877 --> 00:56:31.835
Let us go a bit Blerem man.

1046
00:56:33.505 --> 00:56:34.546
Anyway, respect bro.

1047
00:56:36.424 --> 00:56:37.383
My favourite Albo.

1048
00:56:37.384 --> 00:56:38.717
Damn Serbian.
My brothern I love you.


1049
00:56:38.885 --> 00:56:40.386
Everything's good.
What do you want?


1050
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:47.893
Nothing bro. I've got a
Taui brother. Here for you.

1051
00:56:49.771 --> 00:56:51.021
No buddy, I can't accept it.

1052
00:56:51.773 --> 00:56:53.649
Use this Bro ! 
You know how it works.

1053
00:56:54.359 --> 00:56:56.318
You're out fresh.
Get a bit on your feet.


1054
00:56:56.486 --> 00:57:00.823
We all grew up together, that's how it goes.
Everything's good bron everything's good.


1055
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:03.325
Alright buddy, alright.
I love you amonaui


1056
00:57:03.868 --> 00:57:06.412
Don't you need it yourself man?
I don't need it. I have family bro. Yes.


1057
00:57:06.955 --> 00:57:07.996
Best man. Yes finally yes.

1058
00:57:09.249 --> 00:57:10.249
Yes, brother. But I somehow
expected more of you all.

1059
00:57:11.793 --> 00:57:12.835
This is still coming.
We've got a little bit time left, haven't we?


1060
00:57:13.962 --> 00:57:15.003
Bron thank you.

1061
00:57:16.214 --> 00:57:17.172
We'll be seeing us brother.

1062
00:57:33.231 --> 00:57:36.275
Yesterday boys.
I was almost at home, 10 o' clock or so.


1063
00:57:36.443 --> 00:57:42.364
And then suddenly this strange slut at Tinder texts me.
She says '1What's up, 10 o'clock I'm free of work,


1064
00:57:42.532 --> 00:57:43.907
you want to come over"

1065
00:57:44.033 --> 00:57:48.495
I look at the watch.
I'm like 10 o'clock work's over, eleven o'clock Cologne.


1066
00:57:48.663 --> 00:57:52.374
So up l go.
I quickly drove to her, 200 kilometres up to cologne.


1067
00:57:52.542 --> 00:57:53.667
Such a slut guys.

1068
00:57:53.668 --> 00:57:59.756
I opened the door and immediately got a tongue in my throat.
She's like come with me, bed room.


1069
00:57:59.924 --> 00:58:03.010
I nicely unwrapped my cock.
Under knee, you know?


1070
00:58:03.178 --> 00:58:04.761
You have no idea guys.

1071
00:58:04.762 --> 00:58:12.728
So. I entered, I fucked her 2 times and even
without condom this dahm bitch.


1072
00:58:12.854 --> 00:58:13.770
Bitch man.

1073
00:58:13.771 --> 00:58:18.484
Right, and then I wonder, when I'm ever going to
have something from these cunts.


1074
00:58:18.485 --> 00:58:21.945
man. And then today morning I immediately got back.
Didn't even say bye.


1075
00:58:22.155 --> 00:58:23.655
What do l care?
Such a dirty one.


1076
00:58:23.823 --> 00:58:25.532
I don't even know her name, man.

1077
00:58:25.533 --> 00:58:29.786
The Toni, man. 
Always the Toni.

1078
00:58:29.787 --> 00:58:31.622
What did you do yesterday? 
What happened?

1079
00:58:31.623 --> 00:58:33.916
Nothing Bro, we chilled a bit.

1080
00:58:33.917 --> 00:58:35.334

1082
00:58:36.836 --> 00:58:40.881
Ey, who did you fuck, hm?
What kind of crap did you do again?


1083
00:58:40.882 --> 00:58:43.467
Mio should tell you that. 
That's his story.

1084
00:58:43.468 --> 00:58:44.760
Ok, then on with it.

1085
00:58:44.761 --> 00:58:50.182
No idea, buddy. There was such a motherfucker, you know.
The one, who had something going on with my ex, you know.


1086
00:58:50.183 --> 00:58:51.517

01:02:12.844 --> 01:02:14.136
Yes alright.
It's okay.


1157
01:02:14.303 --> 01:02:18.890
I give you your money but you don't have to
bother me like that or what?


1158
01:02:18.891 --> 01:02:20.559
Jerk, dude. Continue playing your game!

1159
01:02:20.768 --> 01:02:22.227

1163
01:02:30.194 --> 01:02:31.903
Oh damn, what kind of shit is this?

1164
01:02:33.322 --> 01:02:35.282

1167
01:02:48.129 --> 01:02:49.087
Give it to him, brother.

1168
01:02:49.088 --> 01:02:53.633
Come on Apo, away with it.

1169
01:02:53.801 --> 01:02:54.801
Ahh, fuck.

Come, let's stop.

1171
01:03:04.729 --> 01:03:06.730
You'll get really aggressive otherwise.

1172
01:03:06.731 --> 01:03:09.191
I said shut up. Shut up!

1173
01:03:15.448 --> 01:03:17.908
Next Week you get your

1175
01:03:19.619 --> 01:03:21.286

Yes, but it has been important.

1178
01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:31.505
But you'll get it back.
Okay? But now, just calm down and let us go.


1179
01:03:31.672 --> 01:03:36.802
It's not worth it.
It's not worth throwing all this money in this


1180
01:03:36.803 --> 01:03:41.932
we don't even have. 
Come, we'll make us a nice evening.

But we're brothers, brother.
So ... calm down.


1183
01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:58.240
Let's rather go.

01:04:21.472 --> 01:04:24.474
Did you hear Mio?
He goes banging a bitch.


1194
01:04:24.642 --> 01:04:27.727
A Bitch like Sarah man.

She is not like that, man.


1196
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:34.526
She wasn't like that.
Suddenly she just became old man.


1197
01:04:34.527 --> 01:04:37.487
Dude.

So, don't tell me shit man.

1199
01:04:39.323 --> 01:04:42.450
Yes that's what I'm saying.
She wasn't like that, Something happened there.


1200
01:04:42.618 --> 01:04:43.243
Suddenly ....

1201
01:04:43.244 --> 01:04:45.620
Kanak, you weren't like that.
Did you become a romantic?


1202
01:04:45.788 --> 01:04:46.955
What's your problem man?

1203

Yes, I have no idea man.

1204
01:04:47.874 --> 01:04:49.207
You became a softie.

1205
01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:53.670
For some reason she stayed in my head this bitch man.
I swear you, I could vomit.


1206
01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:56.840
Just look at her instagram pictures.
A real whore man.


1207
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:58.425
Tits out, everything.

1208
01:04:58.426 --> 01:04:59.801

Let him be.

1213

Aw Mio. Mio, did the
German father said fuck my daughter?

1216
01:05:15.902 --> 01:05:16.985
You know, this was the problem.

1217

Dude, don't tell me shit.
And that's why she's whoring around like that?

No kidding.
Don't mind her, brother man.

GLB brother. Two to three drops, okay?

01:07:40.671 --> 01:07:41.671
Okay man.

1260
01:07:42.214 --> 01:07:43.173
Junkie.

1261
01:07:43.257 --> 01:07:45.258
Hey Mion hand me the bong.

1262
01:08:02.443 --> 01:08:05.236
Bro, two to three drops. 
Don't overdo it like that.

1263
01:08:05.237 --> 01:08:07.280
Yo, you're fucking with me or what?

1264
01:08:07.281 --> 01:08:09.616
Bro, this is your deal but I'm just saying, so
you're not doing it too late.


1265
01:08:09.617 --> 01:08:11.242
Am I a kid or what?

1266
01:08:11.243 --> 01:08:12.911
Just do what you want.

1267
01:08:12.912 --> 01:08:15.872
You always overdo it.
Hey, hey, guys. please.


1268
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.582
One question.
Is that it?


1269
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.167
Where is the other?

1270
01:08:19.168 --> 01:08:19.918
Bro, it seems like that.

1271
01:08:19.919 --> 01:08:21.586
Is this everything? Hm? Hm?

1272
01:08:21.587 --> 01:08:23.880
Yes, here is a
little bit left. Why brother?

1273
01:08:28.177 --> 01:08:31.554
Why? Because I have no money anymore.
I have no money.


1274
01:08:31.722 --> 01:08:36.518
Everyone pulls, everyone's fine.
I have no money anymore and no stuff and I


1275
01:08:36.685 --> 01:08:38.478
have to deliver tomorrow,

1276
01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:44.109
I have to deliver the money buddy.
Ok? I have to give the money and I have no stuff anymore and


1277
01:08:44.276 --> 01:08:46.778
I have no money.
Because no one of you guys.


1278
01:08:46.946 --> 01:08:49.364
You can pull all but
no one of you has

1279
01:08:49.365 --> 01:08:52.283
the idea to say, hey don't gample, hey don't play, hey don't
do that.


1280
01:08:52.451 --> 01:08:55.620
No. No one's stopping me, no one helps me.
Guys, what am I supposed to do?


1281
01:08:55.788 --> 01:08:56.830
What should I do now?

1282
01:08:57.665 --> 01:08:58.957
The cops stole it from you man.

1283
01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:02.710
The Cops took it.
Dude. Look, he's got contacts to the cops. ok?


1284
01:09:02.878 --> 01:09:07.590
How ... doesn't work ... doesn't work ! Say something bro,
please say something.


1285
01:09:07.758 --> 01:09:08.758
Say anything !

1286
01:09:08.843 --> 01:09:11.386
We'll somehow manage this together brother, we'll do this
together somehow.


1287
01:09:11.554 --> 01:09:14.556
You got tricked or something like that.
We'll find something to buy us some time, man.


1288
01:09:14.723 --> 01:09:15.557
As much as possible.

1289
01:09:15.558 --> 01:09:18.268
For example? Tell me
something, what should we do?

1290
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:20.562
You got tricked by some random kanak, dude.
Is this so bad or what?


1291
01:09:20.646 --> 01:09:21.563
Yes man.

1292
01:09:21.564 --> 01:09:24.983
Ok, that's a good idea brother.
Yes I got tricked by some kanaksn ok some random kanakn ok.


1293
01:09:25.151 --> 01:09:26.776
How should we do this?
Come onn say something.


1294
01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:27.735
How do we do this?

1295
01:09:27.736 --> 01:09:30.655
We're gonna hurt you a bit brother.
We'll do something like that.


1296
01:09:30.823 --> 01:09:33.908
Then you're gonna buy us some time bro
and then everything goes.


1297
01:09:33.909 --> 01:09:35.660
We'll scratch you together.

1298
01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:37.620
Ok, that's a good idea.
That's a good idea, okay.


1299
01:09:37.788 --> 01:09:39.455
I let myself get hustled.
Then I go there.


1300
01:09:39.623 --> 01:09:43.042
Actually nobody's hustling me, bro, nobody's
hustling me but doesn't matter.


1301
01:09:43.043 --> 01:09:47.297
I'll do it so we can have more time.
I go there and say, hey I got hustled. okay? and ... it


1302
01:09:47.464 --> 01:09:51.176
would be best if you'd hit me a few times on my face,
so it looks like that.


1303
01:09:51.177 --> 01:09:53.761
Okay, then I'll get a week again und then ... and then we
gotta do something.


1304
01:09:53.929 --> 01:09:56.222
We gotta do something to get all this shit back in again,
dude.


1305
01:09:56.432 --> 01:09:58.725
We'll manage that, buddy.
Everything that is possible.


1306
01:09:58.893 --> 01:09:59.726
Everything's cool.

1307
01:09:59.727 --> 01:10:00.685
Memo what's up?

1308
01:10:00.686 --> 01:10:05.648
Look at this Junkie man.
He lies there like some ass fucked rabbit dude, pulls all


1309
01:10:05.816 --> 01:10:08.776
the time but does nothing.
He's doing nothing.


1310
01:10:08.903 --> 01:10:11.487
How much of this shit did he take?
How much should he have taken?


1311
01:10:11.655 --> 01:10:14.657
I've actually told him man, but he's never listening to us,
you know.


1312
01:10:14.658 --> 01:10:16.868
Then he always shuts
down dude and nothing happens.

1313
01:10:17.494 --> 01:10:18.328
Memo.

1314
01:10:18.329 --> 01:10:22.707
Every time, dude, all that goes.
But screw that, we'll manage this brother.


1315
01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:25.793
We do this together.
We go out and sell some stuff.


1316
01:10:25.961 --> 01:10:28.338
Gather some bucks, we only need time.

1317
01:10:28.339 --> 01:10:33.927
And we'll get time by making if look like you got hustled,
man.


1318
01:10:34.011 --> 01:10:38.014
Dude, what a piece of crap man ! What a piece of crap.
I swear, what a piece of crap.


1319
01:10:38.182 --> 01:10:40.808
Everyone's pulling here like some junkies amonakuim.

1320
01:10:40.809 --> 01:10:42.769
No one does anything.
No one says anything.


1321
01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:47.148
Everyone's looking for his own ass, ok.
And in the end I'm the one getting fucked.


1322
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:51.236
We're gonna get this straight.

1323
01:10:51.237 --> 01:10:56.074
And can someone get this junkie out of here?
He's lying here around like some wanker.


1324
01:10:56.075 --> 01:10:58.493
Especially from his own apartment, dude.
How awesome would that be.


1325
01:10:58.494 --> 01:11:00.328
I don't care at all.
He can pull all the time.


1326
01:11:00.496 --> 01:11:03.206
With that he can pay his rent 3 times with what he already
pulled.


1327
01:11:03.374 --> 01:11:06.125
But no one's saying anything and
somehow the money's gone and


1328
01:11:06.126 --> 01:11:10.713
the stuff is gone and everything's gone and I'm the one
getting fucked and now I have to go Babo to


1329
01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:12.215
explain him all this crap.

1330
01:11:12.675 --> 01:11:15.260
Bro, this is going to work man.
We're gonna make this straight.


1331
01:11:15.427 --> 01:11:15.927
Believe me.

1332
01:11:15.928 --> 01:11:19.764
We're gonna manage this.
We'll go out there together and shit this thing, dude.


1333
01:11:19.932 --> 01:11:23.059
We'll do something there.
We're not gonna let you hang there, man.


1334
01:11:23.227 --> 01:11:23.851
What's up?

1335
01:11:25.771 --> 01:11:27.981
Ok guys, how are we doing this now, how

1337
01:11:30.401 --> 01:11:32.986
This will look believable man, this will look good.
A little bit, just a little bit.


1338
01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:33.611
Don't scream like that dude.
You're sick.

He's always a problem.


1355
01:12:42.681 --> 01:12:49.354
Always.

What's the matter with this Serkan. What kind of guy is he?


1362
01:14:16.942 --> 01:14:23.281

1363
01:14:23.282 --> 01:14:25.491
Ok, where can we find him? 
Do you know where he lives?

1364
01:14:25.492 --> 01:14:29.537
I know everything about him, everything.
When he's shitting, when he goes out, everything.


1365
01:14:29.621 --> 01:14:32.790
I have to break all his bones, this fucking
son of a bith man.


1366
01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:33.541
What did he do?

1367
01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:34.709
This doesn't matter man.

01:15:05.449 --> 01:15:06.199
And?

1372
01:15:08.994 --> 01:15:11.662
The mother thinks he is working night shifts

1373
01:15:11.663 --> 01:15:12.121
Ah shit man.
Fuck. Yeah, actually that's not that bad.


1374
01:15:12.289 --> 01:15:12.663
Then we have some time to plan.

1375
01:15:19.922 --> 01:15:20.546
Hm.

1376
01:15:20.547 --> 01:15:22.548
That's alright.
This jerk needs a good lecture.


1377
01:15:22.716 --> 01:15:23.966
This little bastard, dude.

1378
01:15:24.259 --> 01:15:25.343
Get a plan ...

1379
01:16:11.181 --> 01:16:12.056
Surprise.

1380
01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:12.848
Hey, who are you dude?

1381
01:16:12.849 --> 01:16:13.683
On your knees, now!

1382
01:16:13.684 --> 01:16:15.101
Hey, who are you? 
Hey, what's going on here?

1383
01:16:15.102 --> 01:16:16.811
Shut up. Hey, be quiet.

1384
01:16:16.812 --> 01:16:17.812
Hey, let me go man!

1385
01:16:17.813 --> 01:16:19.772
I said shut up or
I'll blow your brain out!

1386
01:16:19.773 --> 01:16:21.274
Hey, get up!

1387
01:16:21.692 --> 01:16:23.401
Hey, who are you? Get up, man!

1388
01:16:24.987 --> 01:16:26.237
Come now!

1389
01:16:27.698 --> 01:16:28.823
Hey, who are you guys?

1390
01:16:28.991 --> 01:16:30.950
Hold your mouth! 
Enter the vehicle!

1391
01:16:31.201 --> 01:16:33.035
Get off. Let me go!

1392
01:16:33.537 --> 01:16:34.537
Close the door!

1393
01:16:34.621 --> 01:16:35.580
Hey !

1394
01:16:36.248 --> 01:16:37.290
Come on in!

1395
01:17:00.647 --> 01:17:01.606
Get out.

1396
01:17:06.528 --> 01:17:08.195
Hey, I didn't do anything man.

1397
01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.530
Shut your mouth man!

1398
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:10.323
Who are you?

1399
01:17:10.324 --> 01:17:11.032
Shut your mouth!

1400
01:17:11.033 --> 01:17:12.116
Who are you fucking, hm?

1401
01:17:12.117 --> 01:17:13.451
Wallah I didn't do anything!

1402
01:17:13.452 --> 01:17:14.368
Hm?

1403
01:17:14.536 --> 01:17:16.287
Boy, you're just talking shit!

1404
01:17:16.371 --> 01:17:17.121
Memo!

1405
01:17:17.122 --> 01:17:18.080
Yes?

1406
01:17:18.081 --> 01:17:18.873
Bro, what's going on?

1407
01:17:18.874 --> 01:17:21.459
Hold your mouth man. 
You did some shit again. I know it.

1408
01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.002
Bro, I didn't do anything. 
Wallah what happens?

1409
01:17:23.003 --> 01:17:24.587
What wallah?
What are you swearing?


1410
01:17:24.755 --> 01:17:26.339
You surely did something again.

1411
01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.340
Brother ....

1412
01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:28.174
What are you talking about?

1413
01:17:29.384 --> 01:17:30.593
I've done nothing.

1414
01:17:30.594 --> 01:17:31.469
Don't swear!

1415
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:32.386
Memo ...

1416
01:17:32.387 --> 01:17:33.262
What Memo?

1417
01:17:33.263 --> 01:17:34.680
What did I do, brother?

1418
01:17:34.765 --> 01:17:38.601
Digger, I know all these stories about.
You've probably done some shit again.


1419
01:17:38.602 --> 01:17:39.769
Wallah I've done nothing.

1420
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:40.770
What wallah? He's lying ...

1421
01:17:40.854 --> 01:17:41.312
Brother ...

1422
01:17:41.313 --> 01:17:42.355
Eniste, he's lying.

1423
01:17:42.356 --> 01:17:44.940
Wallah, you're fucking with the wrong man!

1424
01:17:44.941 --> 01:17:45.775
Brother...

1425
01:17:45.776 --> 01:17:48.152
You've fucked with the wrong guys damn it!

1426
01:17:48.236 --> 01:17:49.904
Look at me, look at me.
That's my Eniste.


1427
01:17:50.072 --> 01:17:51.656
That's my Eniste, that's my family.

1428
01:17:51.907 --> 01:17:54.909
I've done nothing... Boys ...

1429
01:17:56.662 --> 01:17:59.538
He's lying, isn't he, Eniste?

1430
01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:03.042
Memo, why are you doing this to me?

1431
01:18:03.126 --> 01:18:04.460
Stand aside now!

1432
01:18:05.921 --> 01:18:08.631
Fuck ... Eniste, you hit
him on the voice box!

1433
01:18:08.715 --> 01:18:10.132
No man, I hit
him in the face dude.

1434
01:18:10.217 --> 01:18:13.803
Man are you blind? Serkan?

1435
01:18:14.012 --> 01:18:16.472
Wullu. I've hit in in the face man.

1436
01:18:16.598 --> 01:18:17.723
Hey ...

1437
01:18:17.849 --> 01:18:19.350
Get up, ey!

1438
01:18:19.434 --> 01:18:20.685
Ey, he isn't breathing anymore!

1439
01:18:20.894 --> 01:18:22.603
Murum I've hit him in
the face man. What ...

1440
01:18:22.813 --> 01:18:24.772
Oh fuck, he is dead!

1441
01:18:25.399 --> 01:18:28.317
What do you mean dead?
What are you talking about?


1442
01:18:28.485 --> 01:18:30.111
Get your things together!

1443
01:18:30.112 --> 01:18:31.445
Hey, Hey.

1444
01:18:45.544 --> 01:18:49.171
What's the matter?
Lan, hey.


1445
01:18:49.339 --> 01:18:55.010
What's the matterwith him.

1446
01:18:55.011 --> 01:18:56.095
Keep your hands off me!

1447
01:18:57.139 --> 01:18:58.806
We have to make a plan now.

1448
01:18:58.807 --> 01:18:59.974
Digger, we killed Serkan man!

1449
01:18:59.975 --> 01:19:03.227
Calm down ... Come to your senses.
Everything's cool.


1450
01:19:03.395 --> 01:19:07.356
Calm down.
We ... We drive and get some gasoline and ... put him


1451
01:19:07.524 --> 01:19:09.817
on fire because of the DNA traces.

1452
01:19:09.818 --> 01:19:10.443
Put him on fire?

1453
01:19:10.444 --> 01:19:13.446
Mulut because of the DNA traces. 
Concentrate, man!

1454
01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:14.864
You want to put him on fire?

1455
01:19:14.865 --> 01:19:19.160
Yes, so they won't find out that we are responsible for
this, dude.


1456
01:19:19.327 --> 01:19:20.453
Now concentrate!

1457
01:19:20.579 --> 01:19:23.664
And what are you going to tell my sister?
What are you going to tell my kids?


1458
01:19:23.874 --> 01:19:25.332
Hm? What do you want to tell them?

1459
01:19:25.333 --> 01:19:29.920
Hey, that's no business to you at all.
Don't bother me!


1460
01:19:30.088 --> 01:19:33.632
Have you understood me?
I said concentrate!


1461
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.427
Let's go, everything's good.

1462
01:19:36.428 --> 01:19:41.432
We're gonna get gasoline now and light him up.
Then he's gone man. Do you want to go to the prison or not?


1463
01:19:41.641 --> 01:19:42.725
No man.

1464
01:19:42.726 --> 01:19:44.268
Yes here you have it.

1465
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:49.690
Eniste.
Mesut Eniste.


1466
01:19:49.858 --> 01:19:56.447
I want to go away.
This whole shit is making me crazy.


1467
01:19:56.615 --> 01:20:06.615
People aren't taking me seriously, they ... laugh about me,
they, they ... they call me junkie.


1468
01:20:10.587 --> 01:20:15.758
I want a completely normal life.
A new life.


1469
01:20:15.926 --> 01:20:23.599
I have other dreams, you know that?
I want ... a wife from home.


1470
01:20:23.767 --> 01:20:30.606
A newjob.
And maybe a little pitbull, with blue eyes.


1471
01:20:30.607 --> 01:20:40.607
You know, that is my dream and ... tomatoes, to harvest
fresh tomatoes from my garden.


1472
01:20:41.159 --> 01:20:48.415
And shit like that.
But ... now I'm here ... with my Eniste.


1473
01:20:48.583 --> 01:20:54.088
Have a corpse there
and within 50 hours ...

1474
01:20:54.089 --> 01:21:04.089
I pulled together with Mio, with Apo ... and with
Cenk almost 50 grams of coke away.


1475
01:21:09.521 --> 01:21:17.820
Boy, what did you say?
You have with Cenk ... 50 grams ... muruk ...


1476
01:21:17.988 --> 01:21:21.365
Are you kidding me?
What did you say?
