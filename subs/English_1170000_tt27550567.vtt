[Mom] Did I, or didn't I?

161
00:07:54.972 --> 00:07:56.538
No. Answer me.

162
00:07:57.104 --> 00:07:58.758
Did I, or didn't I?

163
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:04.285
Did I get the house free
and clear


164
00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:05.983
in the divorce settlement?
Yes!


165
00:08:06.113 --> 00:08:07.724
OK. So I can sell it.

166
00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.640
Of course I don't!
Of course I don't!


167
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.946
I don't wanna uproot everybody.

168
00:08:13.947 --> 00:08:16.863
I can't afford it.
What don't you understand?


169
00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:19.083
I owe 100 grand on the house

170
00:08:19.213 --> 00:08:21.651
and the mortgage repayments
by myself, I can't...


171
00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:24.218
No, I can't pull
any more shifts.


172
00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:26.090
I don't see the kids enough

suddenly magically appeared...

[Kaitlyn]... <i>and he hasn't
said much since.</i>


179
00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:46.501
I think birds are cool.
Homing pigeons do cool stuff.


180
00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:50.201
Yeah, like pooping
and making noises all night.


181

I'd have to ask my mom, but...

185

if you're gonna give them back,
I'll take 'em.


186
00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:02.953
My mom told her boss she'd give
me a week to warm up to them

- before she gave them back.

I want $465,000.

What?

195
00:09:26.977 --> 00:09:28.892
Is that what this house
is worth?

[music starts and stops

197
00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:34.201
All I know is that my mom
owes 100 grand on the house.


198
00:09:34.332 --> 00:09:35.899
And if I had that money,

199
00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:38.728
I'd buy this house
and kick everyone out.


200
00:09:39.685 --> 00:09:40.947
I'd live in here forever.

You know, if I had that money,

202
00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:47.737
I'd give it to you.

203

- Bull crap.
- I would, Kat.

I don't want you to move.

- Yeah.

- See you in the morning.
- Yeah.

The birds.

- The birds?
- The pigeons.

- Jaan who?
- Vari.

All right. He's a very

And he's got this bird,
the Granger,

I'm talking about him.

OK. So, where in Portland?

250
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:47.073
I don't have his address. Uh...

251
00:11:47.204 --> 00:11:49.946
There was an article on him.
Uh...


252

I don't know.

I mean, I'll think of something.

00:13:23.691 --> 00:13:25.650
You can't race it.
It'll fly back to his house.


291
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.000
I'll have him make babies
with my birds and sell those.

You don't have any idea
how to do that.

Then I'll sell it to somebody
that does.

No.

wanna commit a robbery with you?

I'll make out with you.

307
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.481
Like, French kissing,
with tongue?


308

I'm Irish. I don't know
what French kissing is.

Oh, OK. Right.

Can they love

No.

You take them from their home,

you're gonna have to lock them

Do you have an educated opinion

and she started the band
Bikini Kill

01:00:23.421 --> 01:00:24.640
A pigeon race.

1265
01:00:26.294 --> 01:00:28.949
Like, if every pigeon
goes to a different home,


1266
01:00:29.079 --> 01:00:30.646
how do you know which one wins?

1267
01:00:31.865 --> 01:00:33.910
Um, well,
it's actually pretty simple.


1268
01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:35.694
It's just the distance flown,

1269
01:00:35.825 --> 01:00:38.567
uh, divided by the time it took
for the bird to get there.


1270
01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:40.395
And that equals
the yard per minute.


1271
01:00:40.525 --> 01:00:41.396
Boom.

1272
01:00:41.526 --> 01:00:42.571
Simple.

Kaitlyn!
Where were you yesterday?


1283
01:01:18.172 --> 01:01:20.391
After you bring Jaan to my
house to terrorize me,


1284
01:01:20.522 --> 01:01:21.958
you don't show up to school?

1285
01:01:22.654 --> 01:01:24.831
I panicked thinking
something's going down.


1286
01:01:26.745 --> 01:01:28.095
I went shopping with my mom.

1287
01:01:28.878 --> 01:01:30.053
Took the day off.

1288
01:01:30.184 --> 01:01:31.359
Took the day off?

1289
01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.841
Well, I hope you ate tea
and crumpets


1290
01:01:34.971 --> 01:01:36.771
because they don't have
crumpets in jail, Kat.


1291
01:01:36.799 --> 01:01:38.192
What are you talking about?

1292
01:01:38.322 --> 01:01:40.672
About Jaan and his plan
to steal the Granger back.


1293
01:01:40.803 --> 01:01:42.500
Yeah, well, I'm gonna help him.

1294
01:01:43.545 --> 01:01:44.676
Well, I'm not.

1295
01:01:44.807 --> 01:01:46.853
So what are you gonna do
about that?


1296
01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:48.332
Nothing.

1297
01:01:48.463 --> 01:01:50.857
Thing is, we stole
this precious and rare bird


1298
01:01:50.987 --> 01:01:53.424
from this guy, who could have
ruined our lives,


1299
01:01:53.555 --> 01:01:55.905
but he didn't,
which is really cool.


1300
01:01:56.036 --> 01:01:57.733
So if I can help repay the favor

1301
01:01:57.864 --> 01:01:59.648
by helping him get his bird
back then I will.
