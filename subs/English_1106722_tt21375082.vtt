1
00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:02.268
It's christmas 1941,

2
00:00:02.295 --> 00:00:05.671
and our brave men are saying
good bye to their sweethearts


3
00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:07.735
as they head off to war.

4
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.255
- Excuse me.
- Oh.


5
00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:32.658
Since you’re already in my arms
would you care to dance?


6
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.633
Since I'm already here.

7
00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.342
I’m Duke, by the way.

8
00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:46.211
Duke? Nickname?

9
00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.180
Something the men call me.

10
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.082
It means leader

11
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:54.520
Oh. I guess I better to live up
to the name, then, huh?


12
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.089
I’m Marguerite.

13
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.223
Marguerite.

14
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.961
So tell me about yourself

15
00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.731
I live on a ranch,

16
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.034
but it’s not the life for me

17
00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.104
I want to travel, see the world.

18
00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.974
Well, the world, is,
it’s the same everywhere.


19
00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:19.078
Traveling isn't all that
it’s cracked up to be.


20
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.747
I couldn’t imagine a better thing than

21
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.815
to find a small piece of land

22
00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:26.218
to raise a family on one day

23
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.487
What does your family do?

24
00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.891
I don’t really have a family anymore.

25
00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.896
When do you leave?

26
00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.331
I’m shipping out tomorrow

It’s late

50
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.087
You turned off my alarm.

51
00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.756
You need the rest for that cough.

52
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.624
Yeah, well, you know
what they say...


53
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.092
"A good laugh and a long sleep

54
00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.661
are the best cures in
the doctor’s book."


55
00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.329
Yeah, and doctor's
appointments


56
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.132
[Jim]
New batch of ice cream, huh?


57
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.601
You know, you should take some
over to Marcus at the co-op.


58
00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.336
He's a good looking man.

59
00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:27.439
Please stop trying to set me up.
It’s getting a little weird.


60
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.041
Yeah, not a chance.

61
00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:32.678
See, our family believes in love.

62
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.115
So, are you calling
the clinic Of am I?


63
00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.817
You know, the new
Maple Candy Surprise


64
00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.252
is a big hit at
the grocery store.


65
00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.954
Uh huh. Yeah, it would
be an even bigger hit


66
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.956
if we had a creamy of our own.

67
00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:47.258
Getting pretty tired
of shipping our milk out


68
00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:48.862
when we’ve got the
land to do it here.

69
00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.863
- Yeah well, the quality's good.
- Uh huh.


70
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.699
We need to control he
production costs, though.


71
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.701
We’re spending as
much money as we make.


72
00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.369
And if we actually turn a profit,

73
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.636
his could be our future.

74
00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:58.503
this could be our future.

75
00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.872
Could be.
[coughs violently]


76
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.809
Dad...

77
00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.617
Hey. Can you fit my Dad in?

78
00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.619
It's just a cough,
I'll go next month.


79
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.886
hat's what you said last month.

80
00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:15.888
That’s what you said last month.

81
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.924
I’m not going to lose you too.

82
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.197
I'll let them know we’re here.

83
00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:26.966
I could have come alone, you know.

84
00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:27.966
You wouldn'y have come.

85
00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:30.769
Hey Val! I can’t believe
you got him to Show.


86
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.240
Right. You and me both.

87
00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:36.909
It’s a holiday miracle!

88
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.844
I'll let the doctor
know ou’re here.


89
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.047
Ahhh!

90
00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:44.182
My ice cream angel.

91
00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.586
[Jim] lt's 1:01.
They are overbooked, so.


92
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.687
I'm going to come as
back another day.


93
00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.088
Hold your horses, Dad.

94
00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.990
One minute late is not
that big of a deal.

95
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.625
Dr. Franklin was always
on time, if not early.


96
00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:55.594
So let's just go

97
00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:56.962
Sit down

98
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.332
[Holly] Sorry Val.

99
00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.768
The new doctor enjoys listening
to the Veterans’ stories.


100
00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.670
He doesn’t like to rush them.

101
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.239
Well, I guess that’s okay, then

102
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.674
I’ll remind him.

103
00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:10.008
Thank you.

104
00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.182
[Walker]
That is a good story.


105
00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.817
[knocking]

106
00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.653
After you

107
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.124
Okay, so make sure your wife gets this.

108
00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.793
Tell her it’s right down the road.

109
00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.528
And you’re going to
be just fine. All right?

110
00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.864
Thank you for your service. Take care.

111
00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.333
Hi folks. Sorry to keep you waiting.

112
00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:40.405
Umm... I’m Dr. Jennings..

113
00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.941
This is Jim. And I’m Valerie

114
00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:45.143
We weren’t waiting very long. Were we?

115
00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.513
Good. Good

116
00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.682
Just right this way

117
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.351
I'll be out here.

118
00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.891
A military brat who still
travels around a lot.


119
00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.928
Apparently his Dad still lives in the town

120
00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:05.731
and he’s trying to reconnect
with him over the holidays.


121
00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.933
Isn’t that nice

122
00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.635
No wife, no kids. 
Completely single

123
00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.637
Like you

124
00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:13.739
Okay, moving on

125
00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.210
Okay. Not so fast.

126
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.611
How long have you had that cough?

127
00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:21.847
It’s been a bit worse since the summer.

128
00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.282
Okay, so, quite a while

129
00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.251
and you thought it would
go away on its own?

130
00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:28.987
When did you serve?

131
00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:30.689
My time was in the Gulf.

132
00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.092
It’s not really that bad, though.

133
00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.261
I’m only here because of Valerie.

134
00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:45.170
Fit as a fiddle

135
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.838
Like I said, waste of the doc’s time.

136
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.908
I suspect some lung damage
from his time serving.


137
00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.444
IVe ordered some X-rays and
some lung function tests,


138
00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:55.781
but in the meantime,
this should help with the cough


139
00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:58.083
It was nice to meet you Jim

140
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.619
And you as well, Valerie

141
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.088
Thank you, Dr. Jennings.

142
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:06.191
Oh, you can just call me Walker.

143
00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.227
Walker

[video call ring]

145
00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.179
Okay, couple of weeks away
until the Christmas party


146
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.547
and we still don’t have a band

147
00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:29.948
So I need you to get that one

148
00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.083
that we had for Dad's 60th

149
00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:32.484
And your company is still sponsoring

150
00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.119
the grocery gift card giveaways, right?

151
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.655
Hey, Sis. Nice to see you

152
00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:40.025
I’m fine, thank you.
Thank you so much for asking.


153
00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.828
There’s no time for pleasantries.

154
00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.262
When do you fly home?

155
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.363
Ummm...

156
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.301
You're still coming home
for Christmas, right?


157
00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:53.038
Well...
I kind of have a girlfriend


158
00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:54.673
Okay

159
00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:59.478
That’s fine. You can
bring her. It'll be fun.


160
00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:02.447
Bye

161
00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:08.019
[Jim] It is time for a
father-daughter talk.


162
00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.223
Dad, you know chess is not my thing.

163
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.725
I just want you to have more fun.

164
00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.961
Your life consists of what,

165
00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:19.331
maple syrup and your crusty old man.

166
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.633
I love my life.
I love Christmas


167
00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.335
And I love you.

168
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.003
Just let a Dad be a Dad

169
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.938
Don’t you worry about me

170
00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:29.207
Put yourself out there a bit

171
00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.710
Enjoy life outside this farm

172
00:08:31.977 --> 00:08:34.772
Okay. I’ll try.

173
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:37.849
Yeah? Good.

174
00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.952
Now let’s set up
an appointment at the bank.

175
00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:43.922
Because what this ranch
needs is a creamery of its own.


176
00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:45.891
Oh Dad!

177
00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:52.931
Thank you.

178
00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.633
Love you.

179
00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.542
So, I know our mortgage
renewal isn't until next month


180
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.344
but I thought we could look
a using the land for equity.


181
00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:09.614
Your plans are solid but unfortunately,

182
00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:11.816
a strange thing came up on the database.

183
00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:14.653
I’m hoping you can
help me clarify the title.


184
00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:19.157
The land isn't actually
registered under your family.


185
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.297
Who’s it registered under?

186
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:30.936
The owner is a
D Property Company


187
00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:33.672
D Property Company?

188
00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.775
My Grandparents were Marguerite and Henry.

189
00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:38.977
They renamed the ranch M & H
after they were married.


190
00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:42.047
So who is D Property Company?

191
00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.049
I don't Know.

192
00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:47.085
What else does it say?

193
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.357
All I can tell you that the land
was purchased much later


194
00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:56.828
than the original homestead in 1946

195
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.930
It was bought with
a military pension.


196
00:09:58.931 --> 00:09:59.364
It was bought with a military pension.

197
00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.467
Nobody on Mom’s side served in the war.

198
00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.505
Are you telling me it’s possible

199
00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:10.542
that we don’t own any of the land?

200
00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.544
Before we can look at
you borrowing or building


201
00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.813
on that land, you
need to figure that out.

202
00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:17.048
And what if we can’t?
[Greg] Let’s not get


203
00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:18.450
too far ahead of ourselves.

204
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.884
I’m sure you'll be able to

205
00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:22.887
sort this out before it becomes

206
00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:24.823
a bigger problem

207
00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:34.332
I am ready to bake.

208
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.835
Like 10 pounds of butter ready

209
00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.503
That's very ready.

210
00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.006
What’s up? You look like you
just lost your best friend


211
00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:44.009
which can’t be possible
since I’m right here.


212
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.078
My Christmas dreams of the new
creamery have just be dashed.


213
00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:48.480
What?

214
00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:51.783
Yeah, apparently our
land isn’t in our family name.


215
00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:54.019
And I’m trying to find
proof that we do own it.


216
00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:56.488
- But I can’t.
- Okay, let’s


217
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.624
back out of this
rabbit hole, just a bit.

218
00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:02.427
So the land was passed down
by my Mom’s side of the family.


219
00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:04.696
My Dad assumed that
all of it was ours.

220
00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.532
But the records show that

221
00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:11.469
it’s actually owned by some
mysterious D Property Company.


222
00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:15.740
Odd that no one has
claimed it all this time.


223
00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.442
Yeah.

224
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.678
And if they decide to we
could lose everything.


225
00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:23.081
We could lose the animals,
the ice cream business, the house.


226
00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.749
You are a sound business person

227
00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.585
You will think your way through this.

228
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:30.221
Well all we know so far is that

229
00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:33.491
the land was purchased
with a military pension.


230
00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:38.530
You know who might be able to help?

231
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:39.998
Dr. Jennings

232
00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:41.099
- Walker?
- Yeah.


233
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.767
He is a total history but

234
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.436
and he knows all about this town

235
00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.738
all the way back to the
early nineteen hundreds.


236
00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:50.775
Plus he’s looking for another
excuse to see you again.


237
00:11:58.584 --> 00:12:01.152
[Walker] Valerie! Hi.
[Valerie] Hi!


238
00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:03.922
It’s nice to see you again.
Is your Dad all right?


239
00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.023
He’s good.

240
00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:07.859
I’m actually here to see you.

241
00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.128
Oh. Are you feeling all right?

242
00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:11.563
I'm fine.

243
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:12.997
I was just hoping that you might be

244
00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.733
able to help me with something.

245
00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:18.136
Absolutely, yeah. Anything.

246
00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:19.804
How much time do you have?

247
00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:22.640
Oh, ah,

248
00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.342
care to
join me for lunch?


249
00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:25.744
Sounds good.

250
00:12:26.645 --> 00:12:28.313
[Walker]
Okay so the land was purchased


251
00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:30.582
with a military pension.

252
00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.418
Could it be a wartime buddy
of your Grandfather's?


253
00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:36.221
As far as we know, he never served.

254
00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:39.424
What about an uncle or a cousin?

255
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.426
My Grandmother, Marguerite,
was an only child


256
00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:43.328
and my Grandpa’s parents died
when he was really young.


257
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.698
And there’s no record of any
extended family or anything.


258
00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.335
I’m kind of at a
loss on where to start

259
00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:53.171
and Holly mentioned that
you’re a bit of a military buff.


260
00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.407
Oh yeah. Guilty

261
00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:57.609
My Grandmother, Mary, she was

262
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.345
a wartime photojournalist
for the local paper.


263
00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:03.748
She would keep these photo
albums of articles and pictures


264
00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:06.518
about the servicemen from the area.

265
00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:09.487
You know, maybe I could stop
at my father’s on the way


266
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:14.626
home after work and meet you
at your farm around seven?


267
00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.998
Thank you. That would be amazing.

268
00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:21.366
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


269
00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.767
Great.

270
00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.854
[knocking at door]

271
00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:47.892
[Walker] Hey, Dad

272
00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:49.861
Hey, Walker

273
00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:52.697
Sorry about not showing up the other night.

274
00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:57.101
Oh, hey, no, it’s no problem.
Another time.


275
00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.474
Business been good.

276
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:04.976
Steady for now. 
You know how it is.

277
00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.644
Right.

278
00:14:07.713 --> 00:14:09.647
Heard you’ve been
filling in for Dr. Franklin.


279
00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:14.085
Yeah, just for a few weeks.

280
00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:18.756
I know I haven’t gotten back to
you yet about my holiday plans


281
00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:22.126
Oh, you know, it’s okay.
I didn’t come by to hound you


282
00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:24.362
I just, I was actually
hoping to have a look

283
00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:25.997
at some of Grandma's photo albums.

284
00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.398
friend of mine is looking
for someone who might


285
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.400
have served in World War II and was

286
00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:31.302
from around here.

287
00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:34.906
you know where they are.

288
00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:43.014
Okay, I’ll grab them
and be on my way.

289
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.788
These are really good.

290
00:14:51.055 --> 00:14:52.689
Your Grandmother was very talented.

291
00:14:52.957 --> 00:14:55.192
Yeah, she was a trailblazer for sure.

292
00:14:55.193 --> 00:14:59.763
Fearless. Strong. Independent.

293
00:14:59.764 --> 00:15:03.333
She chronicled a lot of
important events in history.


294
00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:06.103
I like her compassionate angle.

295
00:15:06.104 --> 00:15:08.105
It's so human.

296
00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:14.578
I can't imagine how
hard the holidays


297
00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:16.580
must have been back then.

298
00:15:19.651 --> 00:15:23.287
Holly mentioned it might be a
little tough for you this year.


299
00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:30.594
Yeah, Mom loved Christmas

300
00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:37.634
Any kick with your Dad?

301
00:15:39.904 --> 00:15:41.605
Holly mentioned something.

302
00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:42.739
Right.

303
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.147
Yeah my Dad is, ah,

304
00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:52.683
he's pretty set in his ways.

305
00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:56.587
It's fine though. I mean, coming
back here expecting things


306
00:15:56.855 --> 00:16:01.658
to be different was a long shot.

307
00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:03.327
I'm sorry.

308
00:16:03.328 --> 00:16:04.695
Nah.

309
00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:10.033
So you travel around a lot?

310
00:16:10.335 --> 00:16:13.704
Yeah. I’m rarely in one place
for more than a few months.


311
00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:15.606
After this, I'm actually
looking at an opportunity


312
00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.274
in Pensacola.

313
00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:19.810
Florida? Wow.

314
00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:23.146
So you’re just here as
for the holidays then?


315
00:16:23.414 --> 00:16:25.415
That's the plan.

316
00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:37.528
That's my Grandma.

317
00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:39.263
- You sure?
- Yeah, I’m positive.


318
00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:40.931
I'd know her face anywhere.

319
00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:44.935
[Valerie] She’s the blonde,
third from the left.


320
00:16:45.169 --> 00:16:49.139
- Do you mind?
- [Walker] Yeah. Yeah.


321
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.675
[Walker]
She’s beautifuI.


322
00:16:51.676 --> 00:16:53.877
Isn't she?

323
00:16:56.714 --> 00:16:58.882
She was a Home
Front Hostess?


324
00:16:58.883 --> 00:17:01.685
Yeah, she must´ve been.

325
00:17:01.686 --> 00:17:04.221
I never knew. This is...

326
00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:06.456
Wow. I wonder what
that was like.


327
00:17:06.457 --> 00:17:08.692
The Home Front Hostesses were

328
00:17:08.693 --> 00:17:10.093
very important to
the wartime efforts.


329
00:17:10.361 --> 00:17:13.096
Their job was

330
00:17:13.364 --> 00:17:16.666
well, to flirt
and talk to the soldiers.


331
00:17:16.801 --> 00:17:19.102
They lifted spirits,
but they had a very important


332
00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:21.104
set of rules to abide by.

333
00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:23.574
[Valerie] What kind of mles?
[Walker] Well,


334
00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:26.610
have a look.

335
00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:35.552
Do you think whoever this
D Property Company is


336
00:17:35.553 --> 00:17:39.723
might be someone my Grandma
met at one of these parties?


337
00:17:39.724 --> 00:17:41.458
I don’t know.

338
00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:43.760
Was your Grandmother a
bit of a rule breaker?


339
00:17:44.028 --> 00:17:44.828
[Valerie chuckles]

340
00:17:45.163 --> 00:17:46.630
[Valerie] She sure was

341
00:18:00.378 --> 00:18:01.678
Can I write to you?

342
00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:08.552
It's against hostess rules

343
00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:17.260
Well, I suppose this is
good bye, Marguerite.


344
00:18:20.898 --> 00:18:24.234
Thank you for giving me
something to fight for.


345
00:18:24.235 --> 00:18:26.436
Come home safe.

346
00:18:39.784 --> 00:18:41.151
[Marguerite]
Wait!


347
00:18:51.262 --> 00:18:55.132
[Marguerite] My address is on
the back. Don’t tell anyone.


348
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.785
I’m going to write to
you every single day.


349
00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:26.196
[Ben] I had no idea Grandma was
so involved in the war effort.


350
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.031
I mean, she was constantly

351
00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:29.633
telling stories about
the good old days.


352
00:19:29.634 --> 00:19:32.436
It’s kind of funny
that it never came up.

353
00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:33.603
I know. I wouldn’t have believed it

354
00:19:34.138 --> 00:19:35.806
if I hadn’t have seen it myself.

355
00:19:37.675 --> 00:19:39.943
So... Did you find anything?

356
00:19:39.944 --> 00:19:44.681
Ah, yeah, Val, I looked over
the documents you sent and


357
00:19:44.682 --> 00:19:47.984
I’m afraid, legally
speaking, Greg’s right.


358
00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:51.354
We need to prove
that we own this land.


359
00:19:51.355 --> 00:19:53.356
If we can’t...

360
00:19:53.658 --> 00:19:55.592
And if we can't, what?

361
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.727
Worst case,

362
00:19:56.773 --> 00:19:57.928
if somebody else can prove that

363
00:19:58.162 --> 00:19:59.596
they’re D Property Company,

364
00:19:59.597 --> 00:20:02.065
then we’ll lose the land.

365
00:20:02.366 --> 00:20:05.168
Okay, well we cannot
let that happen.


366
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.437
Look, Val...

367
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.774
Maybe it’s time

368
00:20:11.075 --> 00:20:12.809
No it’s not time

369
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.478
[Ben] Dad’s getting older and I know

370
00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.680
you’re the
one doing all the work.


371
00:20:17.181 --> 00:20:18.515
I just

372
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.587
I think maybe leaving the
ranch might not be the worst idea.


373
00:20:24.088 --> 00:20:26.022
That's because you don’t
live here anymore, Ben.


374
00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:29.059
This is my home.

375
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.027
You had other plans too.

376
00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:32.996
Before Mom died.

377
00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:37.667
My plans always included the ranch

378
00:20:37.668 --> 00:20:40.670
You might be willing to give
up on this, but I am not.


379
00:20:40.938 --> 00:20:44.007
Fine. Look. I will keep
researching the deed,


380
00:20:44.008 --> 00:20:47.711
but honestly, it does
not look promising.


381
00:20:47.979 --> 00:20:49.880
Well, we have to find out who
this D Property Company is


382
00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:52.382
because I’m not losing everything.

383
00:20:52.683 --> 00:20:54.284
I’m just not

384
00:20:54.318 --> 00:20:56.319
[Valerie]
I love it here too much.


385
00:21:06.864 --> 00:21:08.565
Leave the ranch?

386
00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:11.601
Yeah, great idea, Ben.
I'll just leave the ranch.


387
00:21:11.602 --> 00:21:13.270
The cows will be fine. Oh yeah.

388
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:16.206
Hi, I’m Ben and I’m a lawyer.
And I know everything.


389
00:21:16.207 --> 00:21:17.607
[knocking at door]

390
00:21:18.743 --> 00:21:20.410
Valerie?

391
00:21:22.346 --> 00:21:24.614
Walker What are you doing here?

392
00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:27.717
- Did you find something?
- Oh, ah,


393
00:21:28.252 --> 00:21:31.021
unfortunately not.

394
00:21:31.022 --> 00:21:34.658
I just thought I’d
stop by and see you.

395
00:21:34.892 --> 00:21:39.062
And your brother To see if you
and your brother had any luck.


396
00:21:39.964 --> 00:21:42.265
No. He just confirmed
what we already know.


397
00:21:42.266 --> 00:21:45.669
If we can’t solve this mystery,
we’re going to lose everything.


398
00:21:46.504 --> 00:21:50.473
And then he suggested that
maybe it was a good thing.


399
00:21:50.474 --> 00:21:51.842
Really?

400
00:21:51.843 --> 00:21:53.577
He moved away for college
right after high school,


401
00:21:53.878 --> 00:21:56.513
so it’s a lot easier for him.

402
00:21:58.249 --> 00:21:59.382
I just hate to
think that this could be

403
00:21:59.383 --> 00:22:00.784
our last Christmas here.

404
00:22:01.352 --> 00:22:05.689
Don’t worry. Hey, we
will figure this out.


405
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:06.790
We?

406
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:08.191
Yeah, yeah

407
00:22:08.192 --> 00:22:13.597
I mean, I said
I’d help and I will.

408
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.368
So what can I do?

409
00:22:19.503 --> 00:22:21.805
Ever bottle maple syrup?

410
00:22:22.073 --> 00:22:23.740
I meant about solving the mystery.

411
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:27.110
If you'd rather milk the cows,
we could do that.


412
00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:29.613
The barn also needs a
really good cleaning.


413
00:22:29.614 --> 00:22:31.915
- Maple syrup it is.
- Great.


414
00:22:36.921 --> 00:22:39.623
Did I mention I’m trying
to cut back on sugar?


415
00:22:39.924 --> 00:22:43.226
Well, you're in luck because we
have sugar-free maple trees.


416
00:22:43.494 --> 00:22:45.428
Very funny

417
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.931
Just down through the funnel?

418
00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:51.268
Yup. Nothing to it.

419
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.671
- Just like that...
- Uh huh.


420
00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:57.040
Down the funnel. [chuckles]

421
00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:58.675
I’m a natural.

422
00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:02.846
So the maple symp is
obviously seasonal,


423
00:23:03.147 --> 00:23:05.682
but the cows seem to
be a lot of work.


424
00:23:05.683 --> 00:23:06.783
Do you have any help?

425
00:23:07.051 --> 00:23:09.920
No, just me and Dad.

426
00:23:10.187 --> 00:23:13.556
I do know that my great
Grandparents had help, though


427
00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:16.326
They had a ranch hand when
they first bought the land.


428
00:23:16.627 --> 00:23:17.994
My Grandma used to talk about him

429
00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:20.163
when her memory started
to get a little fuzzy.


430
00:23:30.508 --> 00:23:31.975
Hello Marguerite.

431
00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:33.376
Hi Douglas.

432
00:23:33.377 --> 00:23:35.545
Oh, here. I can take over.

433
00:23:35.846 --> 00:23:37.247
Your family’s about to
sit down for dinner.


434
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:40.550
That’s okay, Douglas.
I’m almost about done here


435
00:23:40.551 --> 00:23:42.819
Are you settling in okay?

436
00:23:43.087 --> 00:23:44.788
Quite well, thank you

437
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:46.456
The stables can get quite cold at night.

438
00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:49.592
There's some extra blankets
in the loft if you need them.


439
00:23:49.593 --> 00:23:50.961
I’m comfortable, thank you.

440
00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:53.596
It beats sleeping in army
barracks, that's for sure.


441
00:23:53.597 --> 00:23:57.000
And the animals keep it quite warm.

442
00:23:57.234 --> 00:23:59.803
You served?

443
00:23:59.804 --> 00:24:03.473
Unfortunately, my injury sent me home.

444
00:24:03.474 --> 00:24:05.709
But I assure you. 
I can still work.

445
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.144
Well, we´re grateful to have you.

446
00:24:08.145 --> 00:24:10.080
Merry Christmas.

447
00:24:21.792 --> 00:24:25.128
What are you doing?
Let’s go eat dinner.


448
00:24:26.497 --> 00:24:29.899
No, I can’t intrude.

449
00:24:30.167 --> 00:24:32.669
You’re family now.
Come on, let’s go.


450
00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:39.976
Okay, that's an order.
Feel better now?


451
00:24:39.977 --> 00:24:41.344
Come on.

452
00:25:17.715 --> 00:25:21.117
Great...
Your address got smudged


453
00:25:43.406 --> 00:25:45.674
Do you always go all out like this?

454
00:25:45.975 --> 00:25:49.978
Yeah. My Grandparents
got married at Christmas.


455
00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:52.247
So we always do something

456
00:25:52.248 --> 00:25:55.283
but this stuff is
all for the Veterans Hall.

457
00:25:55.585 --> 00:25:57.285
This year is kind of a big one.

458
00:25:57.286 --> 00:25:59.554
It would of been their

459
00:25:59.856 --> 00:26:02.057
so we’re doing a whole
thing at the Veterans Hall


460
00:26:02.058 --> 00:26:03.692
to commemorate them.

461
00:26:03.693 --> 00:26:05.427
Marguerite and Henry...

462
00:26:05.428 --> 00:26:08.296
Seventy-five years together.

463
00:26:08.297 --> 00:26:10.265
- Wow.
- Yeah


464
00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:13.368
They were the most in
love coupie I’d ever met.


465
00:26:13.369 --> 00:26:14.803
Right until the end.

466
00:26:15.104 --> 00:26:18.473
When Grandma died,
Grandpa was completely lost.


467
00:26:18.474 --> 00:26:21.243
He passed a coupie months later.

468
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.848
Lasting love is rare these days.

469
00:26:27.417 --> 00:26:29.684
Well, there probably won’t even be a party

470
00:26:29.685 --> 00:26:32.687
if I can’t figure this all out.

471
00:26:32.688 --> 00:26:35.490
Well, we...

472
00:26:36.626 --> 00:26:38.894
Better decorate that hall just in Case.

473
00:26:39.162 --> 00:26:40.929
- You want to help?
- Yeah,


474
00:26:41.397 --> 00:26:43.398
I'm all in.

475
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.667
Come on.

476
00:26:51.941 --> 00:26:54.943
Merry Christmas 1942!

477
00:26:55.211 --> 00:26:56.812
The men are away

478
00:26:56.813 --> 00:27:00.816
and the ladies are keeping
our home fires burning.


479
00:27:11.127 --> 00:27:13.128
I’m so sorry.

480
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.032
No need. It’s my fault.

481

Who's that?

482
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:26.842
He seems nice.

483
00:27:26.843 --> 00:27:28.810
Mr. Dunfield Jr.

484
00:27:28.811 --> 00:27:31.279
His father owns the factory.

485
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.616
You know, he’s traveled by
pane all around the world.


486
00:27:35.485 --> 00:27:37.752
For the war, you mean?

487
00:27:37.987 --> 00:27:40.822
He served on the frontlines
but the powers that be


488
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.358
decided that with his education,

489
00:27:43.626 --> 00:27:45.293
he'd be better serving here,

490
00:27:45.294 --> 00:27:47.329
running the factory.

491
00:27:57.139 --> 00:27:58.773
I thought the address was blurred?

492
00:28:00.176 --> 00:28:03.478
I was just hoping I can get
it to her someday. All right?

- Merry Christmas.

You're still here?

499
00:28:33.576 --> 00:28:36.444
Kind of my job
to turn off the lights.

500
00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:38.413
Makes sense.

501
00:28:41.317 --> 00:28:44.352
Well, good night.

Marguerite

00:28:47.189 --> 00:28:49.758
My parents are hosting a
Christmas party tonight.


504
00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:53.361
Just some family and close friends.

505
00:28:53.362 --> 00:28:55.864
I was wondering if you’d like to come?

506
00:28:59.468 --> 00:29:00.902
Sorry, it’s the holidays

507
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.071
Of course, I’m sure you have other plans.

508
00:29:03.372 --> 00:29:05.607
No, no. A party sounds nice.

509
00:29:05.608 --> 00:29:08.677
It’s just, I'm not dressed appropriately.

510
00:29:08.678 --> 00:29:10.879
You look perfect.

511
00:29:13.115 --> 00:29:15.884
So... You’ll come?

512
00:30:23.953 --> 00:30:24.819
Grandpa

513
00:31:26.582 --> 00:31:29.117
What else were you hiding Grandma?

514
00:31:37.293 --> 00:31:40.095
No record of any soldier who
could be D from this area.


515
00:31:40.362 --> 00:31:42.564
- No record of Grandpa.
- I’m sorry, friend.


516
00:31:42.565 --> 00:31:45.100
I was really
polling for your Grandpa.


517
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:47.068
It was worth a try.

518
00:31:47.903 --> 00:31:49.337
Hey, why not try social media?

519
00:31:49.872 --> 00:31:50.705

I don’t even what I would post

[text alert]

That wouldn't happen to be
a certain handsome doctor,

00:32:06.322 --> 00:32:08.022
now would it?

527
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.390
He’s been really great.

528
00:32:09.391 --> 00:32:11.626
Oh! A little holiday romance?

529
00:32:11.627 --> 00:32:13.561
I don’t know about that.

530
00:32:13.562 --> 00:32:14.929
I don’t really have time for a romance.

531
00:32:15.197 --> 00:32:16.631
I hate to break
it to you friend, but

532
00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:19.467
love doesn’t wait for the perfect time.

533
00:32:19.735 --> 00:32:20.835
Bye.

534
00:32:20.836 --> 00:32:22.537
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


535
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:31.679
[Walker] Wow, this is quite
the secret love affair.


536
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.083
And I bet this letter holds answers.

537
00:32:35.885 --> 00:32:38.653
I wonder why the secrecy with the signoff?

538
00:32:38.654 --> 00:32:41.189
A forbidden love, maybe?

539
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.525
Or maybe they were
worried about the cards


540
00:32:43.793 --> 00:32:45.760
being intercepted?

541
00:32:48.864 --> 00:32:51.966
Did I say something wrong?

542
00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:53.935
No

543
00:32:53.936 --> 00:32:55.603
It’s just that my Grandparents
always talked about


544
00:32:55.604 --> 00:32:57.238
when they met they knew instantly that

545
00:32:57.239 --> 00:32:59.374
they'd found the one.

546
00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:03.211
I guess I always believed that
love at first sight was real.


547
00:33:03.212 --> 00:33:05.213
This doesn’t prove that it’s not.

548
00:33:05.214 --> 00:33:08.850
I mean, we don't know the
whole story yet, right?


549
00:33:08.851 --> 00:33:10.518
But we do know that Grandma
was in love with someone


550
00:33:10.786 --> 00:33:13.321
back then and it wasn't Grandpa.

551
00:33:13.322 --> 00:33:16.457
We don't know for sure that your
Grandfather wasn’t in the war.


552
00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:18.693
I mean, a week ago you didn’t
realize that your Grandmother


553
00:33:18.694 --> 00:33:20.962
was so involved in
the efforts here at home.

554
00:33:20.963 --> 00:33:23.531
No, Holly and I checked the records online

555
00:33:23.532 --> 00:33:26.367
of enlisted men and
officers No Henry Ashwood.


556
00:33:26.368 --> 00:33:29.103
And that still wouldn’t explain D.

557
00:33:29.104 --> 00:33:31.372
Maybe your Grandfather’s
name wasn’t really Henry.


558
00:33:31.373 --> 00:33:32.774
Holly suggested that too,

559
00:33:32.775 --> 00:33:35.910
and we did a
search on Find My Ancestors

560
00:33:36.178 --> 00:33:37.846
and Grandpa was definitely Henry.

561
00:33:37.847 --> 00:33:40.415
Found his birth certificate.

562
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.551
Was there anything else in the box?

563
00:33:43.853 --> 00:33:47.522
Just this photo of Grandma
working in a factory,


564
00:33:47.523 --> 00:33:49.757
posed like Rosie the Riveter.

565
00:33:57.032 --> 00:34:01.569
Okay, these cards are
declarations of love from D


566
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.005
but there is nothing to confirm
that your Grandmother


567
00:34:04.273 --> 00:34:05.406
felt the same way.

568
00:34:05.407 --> 00:34:10.144
Maybe it was unrequited love.

569
00:34:10.411 --> 00:34:13.448
Then why keep the cards all these years?

570
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:17.584
Sorry, Val.

571
00:34:17.853 --> 00:34:21.823
That, I cannot answer.

572
00:34:23.225 --> 00:34:27.362
Unfortunately, the only
people who can are gone.

599
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:34.489
You should take her out.

600
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.161

[Valerie]
Who is D, Grandma? Who?


603
00:37:31.312 --> 00:37:34.381
You and Dr. Jennings are
spending a lot of time together.


604
00:37:34.682 --> 00:37:35.816
Yeah, he’s been a big help.

605
00:37:36.117 --> 00:37:38.652
Oh. Is that all?

606
00:37:40.588 --> 00:37:42.823
Yes, that’s all.

607
00:37:43.124 --> 00:37:44.257
Okay

608
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:49.196
Fine...

609
00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:53.500
I like him.

610
00:37:54.902 --> 00:37:57.471
Well despite the situation,

611
00:37:57.472 --> 00:37:59.740
you do seem happier
when he's around.


612
00:38:00.008 --> 00:38:02.809
That’s a real shame, because
he's not planning on staying.


613
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.411
He's only here for the holidays.

614
00:38:04.712 --> 00:38:06.413
Plans change.

615
00:38:06.714 --> 00:38:08.448
Life is unpredictable.

616
00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:10.751
I never saw myself as a
rancher before I met your mom.


617
00:38:10.752 --> 00:38:11.785
I never saw myself as a as in
Mapierancher before I met your mom.


618
00:38:21.262 --> 00:38:24.064
How did you know
Mom was the One?


619
00:38:24.065 --> 00:38:26.600
She sparkled.

620
00:38:26.901 --> 00:38:28.301
What?

621
00:38:28.302 --> 00:38:31.671
I don’t know how else to describe it.

622
00:38:31.672 --> 00:38:35.042
She had this glow around
her that was magnetic.


623
00:38:35.043 --> 00:38:37.544
And she touched the hearts
of everyone she met


624
00:38:37.812 --> 00:38:43.383
and she stole mine the moment
that she sent a smile my way.


625
00:38:43.651 --> 00:38:46.987
She did sparkle.

626
00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:49.222
You do too, you know.

627
00:38:49.223 --> 00:38:51.725
And the right man’s going to see it.

628
00:38:52.026 --> 00:38:55.128
In fact, I think he already has.

629
00:38:59.734 --> 00:39:01.701
[Holly] I can’t believe
that your Grandmother


630
00:39:02.236 --> 00:39:03.370
had a secret love interest.

631
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:04.237
I know.

632
00:39:04.505 --> 00:39:05.338
Makes sense why they never

633
00:39:05.339 --> 00:39:06.807
talked about those days.

634
00:39:07.075 --> 00:39:09.009
I feel kind of bad
for my Grandpa.


635
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.211
Well, just because your Grandfather wasn't

636
00:39:11.212 --> 00:39:12.546
her first true love
doesn’t mean he wasn’t


637
00:39:12.814 --> 00:39:14.548
the most meaningful one.

638
00:39:14.549 --> 00:39:17.617
I know. It just changes
the family narrative.


639
00:39:17.618 --> 00:39:20.987
And the whole party centered
around their love story.


640
00:39:22.957 --> 00:39:25.459
What if...

641
00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.762
- theme of the party instead?
- To what?


642
00:39:28.763 --> 00:39:30.197
Well, you’ve spent
these weeks discovering


643
00:39:30.498 --> 00:39:31.898
new things about your Grandmother,

644
00:39:31.899 --> 00:39:34.468
including her war time efforts.

645
00:39:34.735 --> 00:39:36.470
- I’m listening...
- What if you make it


646
00:39:37.004 --> 00:39:39.106
a Home Front
Women’s League Dance theme party


647
00:39:39.407 --> 00:39:41.575
and you honor your
grandparents’ relationship


648
00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:45.512
and their Christmas anniversary,
but you also honor her.


649
00:39:45.813 --> 00:39:48.048
And all the other women

650
00:39:48.049 --> 00:39:49.449
who fought for their country from home.

651
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:50.884
- Exactly.
- And you can invite


652
00:39:50.885 --> 00:39:52.285
Veterans from the clinic

653
00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:53.920
and use it to celebrate them too.

654
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:55.622
I’ll send out invites.

655
00:39:55.623 --> 00:39:58.458
And if you could get
photo from their families...


656
00:39:58.459 --> 00:40:00.127
They might help us solve the mystery.

657
00:40:00.128 --> 00:40:01.228
I’m on it.

658
00:40:01.496 --> 00:40:02.629
It’s a great idea, Holly.

659
00:40:02.897 --> 00:40:03.763
What can I say?

660
00:40:03.764 --> 00:40:05.665
I am a genius.

661
00:40:10.538 --> 00:40:13.039
[Walker]
A Home Front Women’s League Dance theme?


662
00:40:13.341 --> 00:40:16.143
Yeah, it was Holly’s idea.
I think it’s a good one.


663
00:40:17.245 --> 00:40:19.446
Yeah. Yeah.

664
00:40:22.183 --> 00:40:25.886
Thought you might want to invite your Dad.

665
00:40:25.887 --> 00:40:29.589
Oh, I would.

666
00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:32.459
But I doubt he’ll come

667
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.161
You never know.

668
00:40:35.296 --> 00:40:37.898
You know, we actually
used to be pretty close,


669
00:40:37.899 --> 00:40:40.634
despite him being away a lot.

670
00:40:41.536 --> 00:40:44.638
But then, I don’t know, he went
and served in the Gulf


671
00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:46.506
and when he came
back, he just had trouble

672
00:40:46.507 --> 00:40:49.609
reintegrating into society.

673
00:40:49.944 --> 00:40:52.345
It can’t be easy.

674
00:40:52.647 --> 00:40:54.881
I have offered him so much help

675
00:40:55.149 --> 00:40:59.152
but he seems to want to
do things his own way.


676
00:41:01.989 --> 00:41:04.524
You think that’s why
you do what you do?

677
00:41:05.426 --> 00:41:09.596
Yeah, I’m sure it played
a part of the decision.


678
00:41:09.597 --> 00:41:14.100
If I couldn't help him, maybe
I can help others, right?


679
00:41:14.101 --> 00:41:17.804
Yeah. You've definitely helped my Dad.

680
00:41:18.906 --> 00:41:21.775
I can’t tell you how
much I appreciate that.


681
00:41:27.582 --> 00:41:31.151
I have...

682
00:41:31.152 --> 00:41:34.788
really enjoyed our time together.

683
00:41:35.122 --> 00:41:37.290
Me too.

684
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.728
And, ah...

685
00:41:43.898 --> 00:41:46.066
I don’t really stay
in one place too long.

686
00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:54.808
I know.

687
00:41:58.646 --> 00:42:00.347
[car horn honk in distance]

688
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.484
Perfect timing.

689
00:42:05.086 --> 00:42:06.786
[Valerie sighs]

690
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.858
[Valerie] Hey Ben!
See you around front!


691
00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:15.161
[Ashley]
This is a full... farm.


692
00:42:15.463 --> 00:42:16.863
[Ben]
Were you expecting a half farm?


693
00:42:16.864 --> 00:42:20.267
[Ashley]
I thought, like, farm-themed retreat?


694
00:42:20.568 --> 00:42:22.202
This is in the middle of nowhere.

695
00:42:22.203 --> 00:42:23.903
Ah, well, not really. 
I mean, it’s home.

696
00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:25.305
So, it’s somewhere.

697
00:42:25.606 --> 00:42:27.240
No, I know it’s
somewhere but I don’t think

698
00:42:27.541 --> 00:42:28.675
that we’ll be able
to get delivery out here.

699
00:42:28.943 --> 00:42:30.277
[Ben]
I think it’s going to be okay.


700
00:42:30.778 --> 00:42:31.945
No one has starved around here in years.

701
00:42:32.213 --> 00:42:34.681
- [Ashley] Okay! Fine.
- I love you.


702
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.353
[Valerie]
Come here.


703
00:42:51.265 --> 00:42:53.800
You’re early. I wasn’t
expecting you until next week.


704
00:42:54.101 --> 00:42:56.870
You sounded like you needed the support.

705
00:42:56.871 --> 00:43:00.840
Is she planning on spending
the holidays in the driveway?


706
00:43:01.142 --> 00:43:03.543
Yeah, well, we have been
arguing since the airport.


707
00:43:03.544 --> 00:43:06.946
So, I’m kind of thinking
this was a terrible idea.


708
00:43:06.947 --> 00:43:10.550
Or now, maybe that we’re here,
she's going to warm up.


709
00:43:10.551 --> 00:43:12.252
Well, I will reserve judgement

710
00:43:12.253 --> 00:43:14.254
until she actually makes it inside.

711
00:43:14.255 --> 00:43:16.823
I hope you made some of the
spiked Maple Candy ice cream.


712
00:43:16.824 --> 00:43:17.991
You bet.

713
00:43:37.144 --> 00:43:40.180
Valerie! Hi! It’s so reat to meet you

714
00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:42.182
So happy you could make it.
Welcome to M & H.


715
00:43:43.517 --> 00:43:45.218
This is Dr. Walker Jennings.

716
00:43:45.486 --> 00:43:47.687
He’s helping Dad with his lungs.

717
00:43:47.688 --> 00:43:50.423
Yeah, and I’m also a friend of Valerie’s.

718
00:43:50.424 --> 00:43:51.558
Hmmm...

719
00:43:54.095 --> 00:43:55.829
Come on in.

720
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:56.896
Shall we?

721
00:44:04.138 --> 00:44:05.839
[Valerie] They made it.

722
00:44:06.941 --> 00:44:08.308
- Ashley.
- Ashley...


723
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:10.009
Jim.
Nice to meet you.


724
00:44:10.244 --> 00:44:11.611
- Hey son.
- Hi Dad!


725
00:44:11.612 --> 00:44:12.979
Looking good

726
00:44:14.648 --> 00:44:16.616
Make yourself at home.

727
00:44:22.823 --> 00:44:25.024
Hey...

728
00:44:26.227 --> 00:44:30.263
I should probably head out.

729
00:44:30.264 --> 00:44:32.565
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.

730
00:44:34.602 --> 00:44:36.870
If this is going to be
my last Christmas here


731
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:39.906
I would like to
make it a memorable one.

732
00:44:42.042 --> 00:44:43.176
Yeah, me too.

733
00:44:43.477 --> 00:44:44.878
Good.

734
00:44:46.013 --> 00:44:48.314
[Jim] Walker...

735
00:44:49.717 --> 00:44:52.852
[Laughter]

736
00:44:53.154 --> 00:44:54.788
[Jim] Where on earth did you get this?

737
00:44:54.789 --> 00:44:57.056
Under the stairs, where it always is

738
00:44:57.658 --> 00:44:58.792
What is it?

739
00:44:59.059 --> 00:45:02.128
Oh, just a little friendl
family competition.


740
00:45:02.129 --> 00:45:03.863
[Ben]
Not always friendly.


741
00:45:03.864 --> 00:45:05.532
Two to a team.

742
00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:07.767
Ben, you never told me about this.

743
00:45:07.768 --> 00:45:10.570
Yeah, no. Well, I didn’t really
think it would be your thing,


744
00:45:10.571 --> 00:45:12.338
so you don't have to.

745
00:45:12.339 --> 00:45:16.576
Actually, I’m always up
for a little competition.


746
00:45:16.577 --> 00:45:18.044
Yeah! All right!

747
00:45:18.245 --> 00:45:19.646
You know, you can
count me out this year.


748
00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:20.547
I'm getting too old.

749
00:45:20.548 --> 00:45:20.980
- I’m getting too old.
-No!


750
00:45:21.282 --> 00:45:22.649
- Oh, come on!
- But maybe the Doc


751
00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.584
would like to team up with Val?

752
00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.420
Yeah. I'm in.

753
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:30.023
But you are not too old, Jim.
l’ve listened to your heart.


754
00:45:30.024 --> 00:45:31.925
[Jim] Fine. You try to
keep up with my kids.


755
00:45:31.926 --> 00:45:35.528
Oh, but you can tag me in if
you need a rest there, old man.


756
00:45:35.529 --> 00:45:36.362
Deal.

757
00:45:37.231 --> 00:45:38.965
Should I change?

758
00:45:40.634 --> 00:45:41.434
You know what? Yeah.

759
00:45:41.735 --> 00:45:43.336
I'll show you your room.

760
00:45:50.911 --> 00:45:52.645
[Walker] I’m sure!
But I'm a little nervous


761
00:45:52.646 --> 00:45:55.915
about taking part in
your big family tradition.


762
00:45:58.753 --> 00:46:00.420
Put that bowl down
ice cream later.


763
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:02.322
We need to strategize.

764
00:46:03.725 --> 00:46:05.125
Yes, ma'am

765
00:46:08.763 --> 00:46:13.267
You got it.
[cheering]


766
00:47:02.884 --> 00:47:04.785
[Ben] Two, two words

767
00:47:11.492 --> 00:47:14.027
Oh, oh...

768
00:47:14.028 --> 00:47:17.130
Shoveling - shoveling now!

769
00:47:21.636 --> 00:47:23.003
Ashley and Ben for the win!

770
00:47:23.304 --> 00:47:25.839
Bragging rights all year long!

771
00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.774
- We let fem win.
- Yeah, it's good.


772
00:47:34.816 --> 00:47:35.615
Hey!

773
00:47:35.883 --> 00:47:37.851
You’re not watching the movie?

774
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.122
’’Die Hard" is not exactly my
idea of a Christmas movie.


775
00:47:42.123 --> 00:47:43.557
Yeah. Me neither.

776
00:47:43.858 --> 00:47:46.460
A long standing debate in this family.

777
00:47:46.461 --> 00:47:50.163
Do you process the products yourself?

778
00:47:50.164 --> 00:47:52.099
No, I wish.

779
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.533
Until we have our own creamery,

780
00:47:53.534 --> 00:47:55.202
we've got to farm out production.

781
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.170
That's too bad.

782
00:47:57.171 --> 00:47:59.206
This ice cream is truly addictive.

783
00:47:59.207 --> 00:48:01.408
The quality of the milk is amazing.

784
00:48:01.409 --> 00:48:03.043
Thak you.

785
00:48:03.044 --> 00:48:05.278
It’s the grass they graze
and the water they drink.


786
00:48:05.546 --> 00:48:07.014
You take care of the land

787
00:48:07.281 --> 00:48:09.783
Well, I’m doing my best

788
00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.254
Ice cream was our Mom’s dream

789
00:48:14.555 --> 00:48:18.158
Grandma taught her how to
make it and then she taught me.


790
00:48:18.426 --> 00:48:21.495
You’ve really got something great here.

791
00:48:21.763 --> 00:48:25.098
Have you ever thought about
expanding distribution?


792
00:48:25.099 --> 00:48:27.634
Yeah. Once or twice

793
00:48:28.736 --> 00:48:32.139
But I don't think that’s
going to be possible anymore.


794
00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.714
Thanks for coming here for Christmas.

795
00:48:42.383 --> 00:48:44.951
I’ll admit I was nervous

796
00:48:45.219 --> 00:48:47.120
You were nervous? Why?

797
00:48:47.422 --> 00:48:49.856
Ben said you and your Dad
have never really liked anyone


798
00:48:49.857 --> 00:48:52.092
he's brought home.

799
00:48:52.927 --> 00:48:55.729
Well that’s because he’s
never brught home you.


800
00:49:10.845 --> 00:49:13.747
- Can you swing an axe?
- Oh, ah... No.


801
00:49:13.748 --> 00:49:15.415
[they both laugh]

802
00:49:15.416 --> 00:49:17.150
But I aspect that you can

803
00:49:18.553 --> 00:49:19.953
Thanks for coming.

804
00:49:20.254 --> 00:49:22.155
Are you kidding me?
The pleasure is all mine.


805
00:49:22.423 --> 00:49:25.459
I can’t remember the last time
I even had a Christmas tree.


806
00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.261
When I was three or four maybe.

807
00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.530
You guys didn’t a
celebrate at all?


808
00:49:30.531 --> 00:49:33.567
We did, when my Mom was around,

809
00:49:33.568 --> 00:49:36.870
but not in a very traditional sense.

810
00:49:36.871 --> 00:49:39.406
I grew up in military housing.
My Dad was rarely around


811
00:49:39.674 --> 00:49:43.176
so it would just
be the two of us.

812
00:49:44.879 --> 00:49:46.546
So where's your Mom now?

813
00:49:46.848 --> 00:49:50.784
She’s on a Christmas cruise
with her new husband.


814
00:49:50.785 --> 00:49:52.686
I'll be seeing them in the new year.

815
00:49:52.687 --> 00:49:55.455
So that’s where you’re headed next?

816
00:49:55.456 --> 00:49:56.857
That's the plan.

817
00:49:56.858 --> 00:50:00.460
You sure do like to travel, huh?

818
00:50:00.461 --> 00:50:03.430
Yeah. Yeah I do.

819
00:50:03.431 --> 00:50:04.865
The world is an exciting place.

820
00:50:05.133 --> 00:50:07.901
I’ve always wanted to see
as much of it as possible.


821
00:50:09.103 --> 00:50:13.006
What about you?
Have you ever left the ranch?


822
00:50:14.108 --> 00:50:17.277
Yes, I've left the ranch,

823
00:50:17.278 --> 00:50:19.813
once or twice.

824
00:50:20.081 --> 00:50:21.148
No honestly,

825
00:50:21.449 --> 00:50:24.784
I don’t think I
could be happy anywhere else.


826
00:50:27.021 --> 00:50:29.623
And do you guys always celebrate
Christmas in such a big way?


827
00:50:29.624 --> 00:50:31.892
So many questions!

828
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:36.363
Yeah, we do.

829
00:50:38.332 --> 00:50:40.600
for Christmas Eve and
Christmas morning.


830
00:50:42.336 --> 00:50:46.206
Have you given any thought to
what you'll do if.


831
00:50:46.207 --> 00:50:47.607
you know.

832
00:50:47.608 --> 00:50:49.342
Figure it out.

833
00:50:49.343 --> 00:50:51.478
Look at this. It’s perfect!

834
00:50:51.779 --> 00:50:53.480
See what you can do with that thing.

835
00:50:53.481 --> 00:50:55.649
Okay

836
00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:58.185
Stand back.

837
00:50:58.452 --> 00:50:59.853
[Walter clearing throat]

838
00:50:59.854 --> 00:51:01.288
- It’s all in the knees!
- [Walker] Yup.


839
00:51:01.556 --> 00:51:02.989
[grunts] Here we go.

840
00:51:03.224 --> 00:51:03.790
[axe hits tree]

841
00:51:16.103 --> 00:51:19.706
Hey! Your Dad said I’d find you here.

842
00:51:19.707 --> 00:51:20.574
Hey

843
00:51:20.575 --> 00:51:22.509
Oh, he also mentioned the rule about

844
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.178
not touching the Christmas tree.
So don’t worry.


845
00:51:25.179 --> 00:51:27.681
That rule only applies to them.

846
00:51:34.088 --> 00:51:36.923
My Grandpa made it for my Granma.

847
00:51:37.225 --> 00:51:38.391
It’s pretty cute, right?

848
00:51:38.693 --> 00:51:40.660
[Walker] Very cute.

849
00:51:41.796 --> 00:51:43.530
Listen, umm...

850
00:51:43.831 --> 00:51:46.900
I’m really sorry we couldn’t
discover who owns the land.


851
00:51:46.901 --> 00:51:48.335
That's okay.

852
00:51:48.336 --> 00:51:49.736
I kind of wish
I didn’t know so much

853
00:51:50.037 --> 00:51:51.671
about this mysterious D.

854
00:51:51.939 --> 00:51:53.940
Ignorance is bliss.

855
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:57.010
What I can’t stop thinking about is

856
00:51:57.011 --> 00:51:59.813
if your grandmother
married your grandfather,


857
00:52:00.114 --> 00:52:03.650
what do you think happened
with this D person?


858
00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:06.486
Maybe he never came back.

859
00:52:12.159 --> 00:52:14.928
It's Christmas 1943.

860
00:52:15.229 --> 00:52:18.665
Our boys are still at war for
another Christmas season.


861
00:52:18.733 --> 00:52:21.401
Let’s keep the home fires burning.

It's awfully still out there

866
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.221
Maybe we’ll actually
as have a quiet night.


867
00:52:41.522 --> 00:52:43.290
[scoffs] I’d say we’d
have a better chance


868
00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:45.225
of finding a
cheeseburger out here.


869
00:52:54.802 --> 00:52:56.469
[Duke] Well, looks clear.

870
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.438
Might as well stretch your legs.

871
00:53:05.413 --> 00:53:07.047
[Duke V.O.]
Dearest Marguerite,


872
00:53:07.315 --> 00:53:09.582
Another Christmas without seeing you.

873
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.312
It’s going to be hard
to give up the ranch.


874
00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:44.050
Quit my dreams. 
Let down the cows.

875
00:53:44.051 --> 00:53:46.052
Well, I don’t think the cows
will hold it against you.


876
00:53:46.354 --> 00:53:48.355
You don’t know what I promised them.

877
00:53:48.622 --> 00:53:51.191
Listen

878
00:53:51.192 --> 00:53:53.393
I know it's not what you want

879
00:53:53.694 --> 00:53:57.397
but sometimes life just gives you
a different path to follow.


880
00:53:57.398 --> 00:53:59.632
You've spent your whole life traveling

881
00:53:59.934 --> 00:54:02.736
Would you consider following another path?

882
00:54:04.939 --> 00:54:08.641
Well, I hadn't, but now...

883
00:54:08.943 --> 00:54:11.411
maybe, yeah.

884
00:54:12.813 --> 00:54:14.781
Because your Dad's here?

885
00:54:15.282 --> 00:54:17.751
Because you're here.

886
00:54:20.888 --> 00:54:24.224
Val. Did I say something wrong?

887
00:54:24.525 --> 00:54:28.528
No. No, it’s just that.

888
00:54:29.663 --> 00:54:32.732
It’s just that we just met and I
really wouldn’t want you to base


889
00:54:33.033 --> 00:54:37.637
such a huge decision on me.

890
00:54:42.576 --> 00:54:45.345
I’ve never met anyone like you before, Val.

891
00:54:45.646 --> 00:54:47.947
And yes, these feelings came on quick but,

892
00:54:48.249 --> 00:54:51.584
I don’t know,
I know they’re real.


893
00:54:51.585 --> 00:54:53.219
How can you be so sure?

894
00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.155
You said it yourself.

895
00:54:55.156 --> 00:54:57.657
When you find the one, you just know.

896
00:54:59.326 --> 00:55:01.528
That was before.

897
00:55:02.763 --> 00:55:05.765
You also said that lasting
love is rare these days


898
00:55:05.766 --> 00:55:07.700
because people settle.

899
00:55:07.701 --> 00:55:09.602
I’ve never wanted to stay
in one place before,


900
00:55:09.603 --> 00:55:12.605
but being with you doesn’t
feel like settling at all.


901
00:55:12.606 --> 00:55:15.141
It feels like home.

902
00:55:17.378 --> 00:55:20.380
I’m falling in love with you, Val

903
00:55:25.386 --> 00:55:27.687
Walker, I am...

904
00:55:28.289 --> 00:55:30.857
I’m sorry. I think I misread...

905
00:55:30.858 --> 00:55:35.028
Yeah, this whole situation
has me questioning


906
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:36.629
everything that I’ve ever believed in.

907
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.098
Can’t you believe in us?

908
00:55:40.167 --> 00:55:42.101
No, that’s um...

909
00:55:42.102 --> 00:55:43.503
Sorry, that’s not fair.

910
00:55:47.675 --> 00:55:49.943
It's too soon to know.

911
00:55:55.616 --> 00:55:57.851
I will see you.

[knocking at door]

914
00:56:30.918 --> 00:56:32.018
Looks good.

915
00:56:32.319 --> 00:56:34.020
Thanks.

916
00:56:34.555 --> 00:56:38.558
Did your friend find what he was
looking for in the photo albums?


917
00:56:38.859 --> 00:56:42.595
She, actually. 
Valerie Warrick.

918
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:46.499
She’s a dairy farmer here in
Maple Hills, at M & H Dairy.


919
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.735
Ah. She makes good ice cream.

920
00:56:49.036 --> 00:56:50.637
[Walker chuckles] Yeah.

921
00:56:50.638 --> 00:56:53.206
You two...?

922
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:55.174
Ah...

923
00:56:55.175 --> 00:57:00.146
Don’t make too much of it, Dad.
She’s not interested.


924
00:57:01.282 --> 00:57:03.216
So, I guess that means
You'll still be leaving


925
00:57:03.217 --> 00:57:05.718
after the holidays?

926
00:57:06.587 --> 00:57:11.257
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

927
00:57:12.893 --> 00:57:17.730
She wanted to thank you
for Grandma's photo albums.


928
00:57:17.731 --> 00:57:19.999
We couldn’t find enough
answers to save her ranch,


929
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.634
but Valerie learned some
things that she never knew


930
00:57:21.635 --> 00:57:23.903
about her Grandmother.

931
00:57:28.642 --> 00:57:29.976
I was heading out.

932
00:57:29.977 --> 00:57:32.211
I got to get this chair
delivered over at Evergreen.


933
00:57:32.513 --> 00:57:34.747
Yeah, I won’t keep you.

934
00:57:34.748 --> 00:57:41.087
But I wanted to stop by
and invite you to...


935
00:57:41.388 --> 00:57:46.192
Valerie is hosting a Home Front
themed Christmas Eve party


936
00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.862
to honor local Veterans.

937
00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:52.365
She wanted me to invite you.

938
00:57:56.236 --> 00:57:58.838
I don't think I can make it.

939
00:58:01.075 --> 00:58:03.242
You got other
Christmas Eve plans?


940
00:58:03.243 --> 00:58:06.846
You know the holidays
really aren’t my thing.


941
00:58:12.152 --> 00:58:15.488
You know, I came home this year
to try and connect with you.

01:00:20.714 --> 01:00:25.518
Yeah. Yeah, just a lot on my mind.

965
01:00:25.819 --> 01:00:28.354
Thinking about what comes next for you?

966
01:00:28.355 --> 01:00:31.724
Yeah. Dr. Franklin will be
back in the new year, right.


967
01:00:32.025 --> 01:00:35.895
Only part time. We could
always use another physician.


968
01:00:36.163 --> 01:00:40.967
There’s another opportunity
for me in Pensacola.


969
01:00:42.136 --> 01:00:44.737
Maybe there's a better opportunity

970
01:00:44.738 --> 01:00:48.007
for you here as well.

971
01:01:04.992 --> 01:01:07.827
[Walker] What are you trying to show us?

972
01:01:27.047 --> 01:01:28.114
Duke?

973
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:41.076
What are you trying to say, Grandma?

974
01:01:47.634 --> 01:01:48.767
[knocking]

975
01:01:51.805 --> 01:01:53.472
Hey

976
01:01:53.473 --> 01:01:55.140
Hi.

977
01:01:57.644 --> 01:01:59.878
Your Dad let me in.

978
01:02:01.214 --> 01:02:02.648
Um...

979
01:02:02.916 --> 01:02:06.518
I think there’s
something you should see.


980
01:02:44.124 --> 01:02:45.491
Marguerite.

981
01:02:46.926 --> 01:02:50.095
You look stunning.

982
01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:52.531
Thank you.

983
01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.302
I’m just grateful to be home
this year to celebrate with you.


984
01:02:58.171 --> 01:02:59.838
Me too.

985
01:03:03.209 --> 01:03:06.578
I’m sorry. I can’t accept this.

986
01:03:12.419 --> 01:03:14.686
[Marguerite] You’re a good man.

987
01:03:14.687 --> 01:03:17.756
But...

988
01:03:17.757 --> 01:03:20.325
my heart's with someone else.

989
01:03:25.899 --> 01:03:28.667
Then, he’s a lucky man.

990
01:03:29.736 --> 01:03:34.273
[Boss]
Please. Keep this.


991
01:03:34.808 --> 01:03:38.410
It wouldn't look as good on anyone else.

992
01:03:42.315 --> 01:03:44.850
Merry Christmas, Marguerite.

993
01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:46.552
Merry Christmas.

994
01:04:08.908 --> 01:04:11.376
[Marguerite reads] Thank you for
giving me a chance on the ranch.


995
01:04:11.377 --> 01:04:13.111
Douglas.

996
01:05:06.665 --> 01:05:08.633
Grandpa always said he kept
all his hopes in the barn.


997
01:05:08.934 --> 01:05:10.835
This is the last place I can think
of to look for more clues.


998
01:05:10.836 --> 01:05:13.905
- Okay.
- So you take this one.


999
01:05:13.906 --> 01:05:15.339
And I'll try here.

1000
01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.008
Right here? Okay.

1001
01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:43.501
Val, I think I found something.

1002
01:05:50.876 --> 01:05:52.777
These are letters from my
Grandma to my Grandpa.


1003
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:58.649
Here.

1004
01:06:08.427 --> 01:06:12.096
So Grandpa is Duke.
And D is for Duke!


1005
01:06:12.097 --> 01:06:15.266
Look! Here she just writes
'To My Dearest D',


1006
01:06:15.567 --> 01:06:17.735
but earlier on she wrote
’My dearest Duke’.


1007
01:06:17.736 --> 01:06:19.470
So he did fight in the war.

1008
01:06:19.705 --> 01:06:22.740
He never, ever
talked about it.


1009
01:06:22.808 --> 01:06:24.475
I guess it must have
been too painful.


1010
01:06:24.476 --> 01:06:25.910
I think I found
something even better.


1011
01:06:26.178 --> 01:06:28.679
In this one, she talks about
buyjng the land next to her


1012
01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:32.350
family’s, so that she can expand
and start their own family.


1013
01:06:32.351 --> 01:06:34.552
[laughter]

1014
01:06:38.824 --> 01:06:41.592
[Valerie] Thank you for meeting
with me on Christmas Eve.


1015
01:06:42.394 --> 01:06:43.995
This won’t take long

1016
01:06:51.637 --> 01:06:56.641
The incorporation papers
for D Property Company.


1017
01:06:57.776 --> 01:07:00.311
The same scratchy
signature, right?


1018
01:07:00.312 --> 01:07:02.279
And that military pension?

1019
01:07:02.581 --> 01:07:05.049
We finally found one,
under Hank Ashwood.


1020
01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:06.917
Not that many people called
Grandpa Hank but Grandma did


1021
01:07:06.918 --> 01:07:09.787
when he forgot to leave
his muddy boots outside.


1022
01:07:14.493 --> 01:07:16.961
Which wasn't very often.

1023
01:07:20.098 --> 01:07:23.801
Well, no one can deny
that the signature from


1024
01:07:24.036 --> 01:07:27.338
the incorporation papers
matches the one on the title.


1025
01:07:27.673 --> 01:07:33.844
And the photo of your
Grandpa solidifies it.


1026
01:07:36.148 --> 01:07:38.049
So, we're all clear?

1027
01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:39.750
Yes.

1028
01:07:40.052 --> 01:07:41.752
Merry Christmas, Val.

1029
01:07:42.621 --> 01:07:44.889
Merry Christmas, Greg.

1030
01:07:47.159 --> 01:07:48.859
Give my best to your family

1031
01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.660
I will.

1032
01:08:00.205 --> 01:08:01.305
[knocking]

1033
01:08:01.306 --> 01:08:02.740
Hello?

1034
01:08:04.076 --> 01:08:05.476
Can I help you?

1035
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:09.346
Yes. I’m Valerie Warrick.

1036
01:08:09.614 --> 01:08:11.282
I’m Walker's friend.

1037
01:08:11.283 --> 01:08:12.950
Right.

1038
01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:15.052
Good ice cream.

1039
01:08:15.053 --> 01:08:18.689
This is very beautiful You make it?

1040
01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:22.026
Yeah. Just a hobby

1041
01:08:22.027 --> 01:08:23.994
It’s more than just a hobby.

1042
01:08:26.598 --> 01:08:29.433
Anyway, I just came here to thank you.

1043
01:08:29.735 --> 01:08:35.171
Your Mother's photo
albums were enlightening.


1044
01:08:35.172 --> 01:08:37.675
And they helped save our land.

1045
01:08:37.676 --> 01:08:39.643
Because I had no idea

1046
01:08:39.911 --> 01:08:42.747
how involved my grandparents
were in the war.


1047
01:08:42.748 --> 01:08:45.282
They just never talked about it.

1048
01:08:45.283 --> 01:08:48.919
Sometimes it’s easier to forget.

1049
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.488
A lot of us
just want to move on.

1050
01:08:53.225 --> 01:08:56.327
I can understand that.

1051
01:08:56.561 --> 01:08:58.195
Walker wants to help.

1052
01:08:58.463 --> 01:09:02.133
but who wants to talk
about feelings all day?


1053
01:09:04.903 --> 01:09:08.272
I’m sure it’s hard to re-live everything.

1054
01:09:08.273 --> 01:09:10.941
It just is what it is.

1055
01:09:14.546 --> 01:09:16.247
Well, thanks again.

1056
01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:24.354
Actually,

1057
01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:28.792
do you have a chess board that
I can buy for my Dad?


1058
01:09:29.127 --> 01:09:31.362
I’m almost finished with this one.

1059
01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:34.165
Do you think you could have it
ready for tomorrow morning?


1060
01:09:34.733 --> 01:09:35.866
Sure, no problem.

1061
01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:39.236
Time enough for the varnish to dry.

1062
01:09:39.538 --> 01:09:43.073
Perfect. Thanks.

1063
01:09:43.942 --> 01:09:46.042
I want to thank you too.

1064
01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:50.814
For giving Walker a Christmas I never could.

1065
01:09:53.585 --> 01:09:56.620
The invite for tonight still stands.

1066
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.832
All you can eat ice cream.

1067
01:10:30.388 --> 01:10:32.389
[Walker] All right.

1068
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:34.091
Merry Christmas!

1069
01:10:37.195 --> 01:10:39.697
That is the last appointment of the day.

1070
01:10:39.698 --> 01:10:42.233
I’m heading out.
I’ll see you tonight at the party?


1071
01:10:42.234 --> 01:10:45.302
Ah, yeah. I promised
Jim I’d be there. So...

1072
01:10:45.303 --> 01:10:48.906
Valerie is looking forward to
seeing you too, you know.


1073
01:10:50.242 --> 01:10:51.642
Drive safe, Holly.

1074
01:11:24.274 --> 01:11:30.913
[music]
[indistinct conversations]


1075
01:11:37.654 --> 01:11:39.688
Marguerite and Henry...

1076
01:11:39.689 --> 01:11:43.926
Wow! What an incredible love story.

1077
01:11:46.463 --> 01:11:49.231
So has it restored your faith?

1078
01:11:50.634 --> 01:11:53.102
- In love?
- Yeah. What else?


1079
01:11:53.103 --> 01:11:56.439
That is all that matters
in life, sweetheart.


1080
01:11:57.474 --> 01:11:59.408
Yeah.

1081
01:11:59.409 --> 01:12:02.111
Grandma and Grandpa really
were soulmates, weren’t they?


1082
01:12:02.379 --> 01:12:03.813
Yes.

1083
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.048
But they also committed to staying in love

1084
01:12:06.049 --> 01:12:08.217
when life separated them,
relying on the faith


1085
01:12:08.218 --> 01:12:10.786
of their commitment.

1086
01:12:11.121 --> 01:12:14.990
You know, your Mom and I thought
that it was a real privilege


1087
01:12:16.159 --> 01:12:18.961
to have someone to share
that commitment with.


1088
01:12:19.262 --> 01:12:20.663
Oh, Dad.

1089
01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:25.134
She said she was honored to
work on your love together.


1090
01:12:25.402 --> 01:12:27.102
I think she was right.

1091
01:12:30.207 --> 01:12:31.574
There’s someone I need
to talk to about that.


1092
01:12:31.842 --> 01:12:35.711
Yeah? A handsome
young doctor, maybe?


1093
01:12:36.012 --> 01:12:38.214
You’re such a romantic.

1094
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:43.519
Walker...

1095
01:12:43.787 --> 01:12:48.023
Um, look... If it's not too
late, I think I might have


1096
01:12:48.024 --> 01:12:50.559
one more photo for the display.

1097
01:12:52.295 --> 01:12:57.132
Grandpa and Grandma...
Duke and Marguerite...

You’re home.
You’re really here.


1108
01:13:43.213 --> 01:13:46.815
There was this one minor, minor
problem with your address.


1109
01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:51.654
But I thought about you every
Christmas. Every day, actually.


1110
01:13:51.655 --> 01:13:54.256
I’ve never given up on you,

1111
01:13:54.257 --> 01:13:58.794
on the hope that someday
you'd come back to me.


1112
01:14:00.163 --> 01:14:02.131
You kept it.

1113
01:14:02.132 --> 01:14:04.633
You were thinking about me too.

1114
01:14:05.468 --> 01:14:09.838
Marguerite, these last few years,

1115
01:14:09.839 --> 01:14:12.975
all I’ve ever thought
about is you.


1116
01:14:12.976 --> 01:14:14.343
Just the thought of coming home to you

1117
01:14:14.344 --> 01:14:17.780
made every moment apart bearable.

1118
01:14:17.781 --> 01:14:20.549
Look, I know you said you.
wanted a life full of excitement


1119
01:14:20.817 --> 01:14:23.953
and I’m not sure
I can give you that.

1120
01:14:23.954 --> 01:14:27.890
But I do know, that deep down
in the bottom of my heart,


1121
01:14:28.191 --> 01:14:31.193
I can give you every
ounce of love I have.


1122
01:14:31.494 --> 01:14:34.797
A life with you is all
the excitement I need.


1123
01:14:49.679 --> 01:14:51.680
Will you marry me?

1124
01:14:51.915 --> 01:14:56.151
Yes, Duke, I'll marry you.

1125
01:14:56.152 --> 01:14:59.154
I love you.

1126
01:15:03.159 --> 01:15:04.059
Wait.

1127
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:07.596
I should know your real name first.

1128
01:15:07.597 --> 01:15:09.231
It’s Henry.

1129
01:15:09.232 --> 01:15:11.200
- Henry...
- Henry Ashwood.


1130
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:13.402
I’m going to enjoy calling you that.

1131
01:15:15.905 --> 01:15:19.208
Well, my friends, they call me Hank.

1132
01:15:19.209 --> 01:15:22.244
It’s a pleasure to meet you Hank.

1133
01:15:42.599 --> 01:15:44.533
Thank you for giving me
best Christmas present


1134
01:15:44.534 --> 01:15:46.168
I could have hoped for.

1135
01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.772
Well, I may have an even better one.

1136
01:15:51.207 --> 01:15:53.142
I know that you said it’s
too soon to be sure,


1137
01:15:53.410 --> 01:15:55.911
but, for me,

1138
01:15:57.113 --> 01:15:59.948
I’ve never been so sure
of anything in my life.


1139
01:15:59.949 --> 01:16:05.554
And you’ve given me the best
Christmas that I’ve ever had.


1140
01:16:05.889 --> 01:16:08.924
I know the ranch
is home for you, but...

1141
01:16:09.225 --> 01:16:10.292
for me,

1142
01:16:10.293 --> 01:16:13.095
home is with you.

1143
01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:16.699
I know how I feel is real.

1144
01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:19.501
And it’s bigger than just right now.

1145
01:16:19.803 --> 01:16:22.104
Walker, I love you.

1146
01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:27.876
Enough to marry me?

1147
01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.360
Yeah, I'll marry you.

1148
01:16:45.895 --> 01:16:48.997
[clapping and cheering]

1149
01:17:04.981 --> 01:17:06.648
We’re getting married!

1150
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:07.783
Congratulations!

1151
01:17:07.784 --> 01:17:13.155
[clapping]

1152
01:17:17.093 --> 01:17:19.061
[Valerie]
Merry Christmas everyone!


1153
01:17:19.629 --> 01:17:20.729
Oh, you can have it if you want.

1154
01:17:21.264 --> 01:17:22.698
[Jim] Uh no, I'm good. I'm good.

1155
01:17:22.999 --> 01:17:28.537
[chatter, laughter]

1156
01:17:29.105 --> 01:17:30.739
[knocking at door]

1157
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.907
Oh, Santa's here.

1158
01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:32.975
I'll get it.

1159
01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:35.477
Are you expecting Santa?

1160
01:17:36.045 --> 01:17:37.446
Not really.

1161
01:17:38.414 --> 01:17:40.015
Please come in.

1162
01:17:42.252 --> 01:17:44.419
[Roy] I don’t want to intrude.

1163
01:17:45.255 --> 01:17:47.156
Don’t be silly, it’s Christmas.

1164
01:17:50.827 --> 01:17:52.494
Dad.

1165
01:17:58.134 --> 01:18:00.435
Merry Christmas, son.

1166
01:18:07.544 --> 01:18:08.710
Thanks for coming.

1167
01:18:14.284 --> 01:18:16.485
Everyone, this is my Dad.

1168
01:18:17.854 --> 01:18:19.321

I'm going to be leaving the main

those of you who want to
expand your business and ahem,

laughter]

1187
01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:09.271
A spring wedding it is, I guess.

1188
01:19:09.272 --> 01:19:11.240
I guess so.

1189
01:19:13.243 --> 01:19:16.345
