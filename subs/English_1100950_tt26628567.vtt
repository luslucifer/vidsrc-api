00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.666
It's got to be against
the law to look this damn good.


2
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.434
Watch out now.

3
00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:42.371
'Cause baby, I feel real
good, and I wish I would.


4
00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:44.105
Watch out now.

5
00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:46.941
It's gotta be against the
law to look this damn good.


6
00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:48.410
Watch out now.

7
00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:50.545
Everybody, watch out.

8
00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.348
Watch out now.

9
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:56.184
I'm ready for a good time,
and I came to groove.


10
00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.353
The whole band's here,
and we came to move.


11
00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:00.722
Got a fresh haircut
and two new shoes.


12
00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:02.857
We're here all night, like
we got nothing to lose.


13
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.225
I'm coming out
this jacket 'cause


14
00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:05.694
we're turning up the heat.

15
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.729
I want to see you clapping
when you get up out your seat.


16
00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:09.964
It's time to make it happen
when we hit these streets.


17
00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:12.066
I'm coming in hot,
and I can't be beat.


18
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.134
Watch out now.

19
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.306
Baby, watch out now.

20
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.044
Watch out.

21
00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.486
I'm on the move.

22
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.821
I'm going up.

23
00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:34.723
I'm a man on a mission
with no misses,


24
00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.425
and I'm looking for love.

25
00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.260
Oh, I'm just looking for love.

26
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.134
Make it slow, make it slow.

27
00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:47.569
I can't, I can't.

28
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.604
No.

29
00:03:49.638 --> 00:03:52.140
Hold me back.

30
00:03:52.173 --> 00:03:57.412
Oh, no I said I can't, I can't.

31
00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.414
No.

32
00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:01.683
Let you go.

33
00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:23.271
I won't
let you hold me back.


34
00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:28.610
No, you can't keep
holding me back.


35
00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.145
Come on.

36
00:04:37.218 --> 00:04:40.622
I ain't
got no lot to pay.


37
00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:43.892
I ain't got no time today.

38
00:04:43.925 --> 00:04:45.126
How's it going?

39
00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.461
It's super.

40
00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:48.062
Got big plans to have
the best day of my life.


41
00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:49.130
Mm.

42
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.164
Vodka, please.

43
00:04:50.198 --> 00:04:52.567
And yourself?

44
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:54.503
Well, 6 AM shift's
kicking my butt.


45
00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:55.637
But I'll live.

46
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.671
Been there myself.

47
00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:57.672
It's a real bitch, right?

48
00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:00.909
Yeah, kids in school.

49
00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:06.147
That'll be $5.08.

50
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.083
Ugh, looks like I'm a
little short on cash.


51
00:05:09.117 --> 00:05:10.419
You take credit?

52
00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:11.686
I just need to see your ID.

53
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.621
Not a problem.

54
00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:20.261
You're Chris?

55
00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:21.262
That's me.

56
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.366
Should have kept the 'do.

57
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.601
You know, it suits you.

58
00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:28.670
Got a job interview
at a fancy law firm,


59
00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.939
and the boss man specifically
said no hippie lawyers.


60
00:05:30.972 --> 00:05:32.073
You believe that?

61
00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:35.076
Welcome to Tallahassee.

62
00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:36.945
There's your card, Chris.

63
00:05:36.978 --> 00:05:38.079
Thank you.

64
00:05:38.112 --> 00:05:39.047
You want me to bag
this up for you?


65
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.014
Why the heck not?

66
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:40.949
All right.

67
00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:48.089
You know who you look like?

68
00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:50.291
John Denver, that's who it is.

69
00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:51.392
Uncanny.

70
00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:53.895
You have a good day now.

71
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:13.748
Hey, come on, Belle.

72
00:06:13.782 --> 00:06:15.316
What are you looking at?

73
00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.385
Come on, let's go.

74
00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:19.053
Hi, Dorothy.

75
00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:20.088
How are you?

76
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.322
Good to see you.

77
00:06:21.355 --> 00:06:22.290
Having a good day?

78
00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:24.325
Yeah.

79
00:06:24.358 --> 00:06:27.128
I'm thinking I actually
might go out dancing later.


80
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:30.499
Might as well get in one last
hurrah before classes start.


81
00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:33.602
Oh, maybe I'll go
with you and see


82
00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:36.738
if I can find some cute guy
to help me around the house.


83
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.006
Oh!

84
00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:42.644
Well, I have to go get
my dry cleaning ready.


85
00:06:42.677 --> 00:06:45.146
But I will catch you
on the flip side.


86
00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:47.315
Hey, if you want
to stop by my house


87
00:06:47.348 --> 00:06:49.584
and watch the football
game, come on by.


88
00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:51.586
Oh yeah, awesome.
Thanks for the invite.


89
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.621
OK.

90
00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:53.588
Far out, sounds good.

91
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:54.623
Bye.

92
00:06:54.656 --> 00:06:55.624
See you later.

93
00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:57.458
Come on, baby. Let's go.

94
00:07:02.997 --> 00:07:07.802
Hey, what's that?

95
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:25.379
Hey guys, I'm heading
to the bank for a bit.


96
00:08:25.413 --> 00:08:26.615
Let me know if anyone calls.

97
00:08:26.648 --> 00:08:27.616
I'm waiting to hear
from scheduling.


98
00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:28.717
No problem.

99
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.118
Enjoy the bank.

100
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:32.086
Maybe if there was more
money in my account, I would.


101
00:08:36.257 --> 00:08:37.792
See you guys later.

102
00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.907
Hi, Lori.

103
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:56.077
Ellen spent a good six
hours trying to convince me


104
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.747
this was going to get easier
after I dropped you off


105
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.448
for the fall semester.

106
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.952
I told her she's
out of her mind.


107
00:09:03.985 --> 00:09:06.955
It's the same five hour drive
it was the last time, OK?


108
00:09:06.988 --> 00:09:10.058
It's not like the continental
plates moved or anything.


109
00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:12.894
Yeah, but with the energy crisis
and the lower speed limit,


110
00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.595
it feels a lot farther.

111
00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:19.868
Bonjour.

112
00:09:22.303 --> 00:09:25.740
Parlez-vous francais?

113
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:26.908
Oui.

114
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.743
Heck of a day, huh?

115
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.979
For January.

116
00:09:31.012 --> 00:09:32.313
OK listen, full confession.

117
00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:34.983
I can't lie to a
face like yours.


118
00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:38.586
I don't really speak French.

119
00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:42.090
Well, I was president of
the French Honor Society


120
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.157
and you fooled me.

121
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:44.358
That's what I've heard.

122
00:09:44.392 --> 00:09:46.761
Me, I'm a law
student, grad school.


123
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:49.698
Only a few credits left,
then it's off to Miami.


124
00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:51.866
Corporate law firm there
caught wind of my GPA


125
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.869
and swooped in
early with an offer.


126
00:09:54.903 --> 00:09:57.138
So listen, a friend of
mine lives a couple houses


127
00:09:57.171 --> 00:09:58.206
down from here.

128
00:09:58.239 --> 00:09:59.974
And I promised I'd
give him some gym


129
00:10:00.008 --> 00:10:01.309
equipment I don't use anymore.

130
00:10:01.342 --> 00:10:03.111
But there's just one problem.

131
00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.345
What's that?

132
00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:05.847
Last semester flew by, OK?

133
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.648
Summer break will be
here before you know it.


134
00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:08.616
I'll be back, OK?

135
00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:10.051
Got it?

136
00:10:10.084 --> 00:10:12.353
Yeah. But I got to give you
a little hell about it


137
00:10:12.386 --> 00:10:14.122
before I leave, you know?

138
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.557
Yes, I know.

139
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.892
Lori!

140
00:10:17.926 --> 00:10:19.027
Hi.

141
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.830
So get out of the car.

142
00:10:21.863 --> 00:10:24.799
I need to give you
a big, big hug.


143
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:25.767
Oh!

144
00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:31.372
Got into a fight with the
pavement the other day and lost.


145
00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:33.708
Mm, I can see that.

146
00:10:33.742 --> 00:10:34.876
Well, what about your friend?

147
00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:36.010
Can he help you out?

148
00:10:36.044 --> 00:10:37.078
Normally, you would.

149
00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:38.646
But it's kind of a surprise.

150
00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.681
Got it in his head that
I'm not following through


151
00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:42.516
on my promise, so he's
kind of pissed at me.


152
00:10:45.386 --> 00:10:47.321
All right.

153
00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:51.159
But before I help you
out, what's your name?


154
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:54.562
What do you think it is?

155
00:10:54.595 --> 00:10:57.932
Well, normally I would
guess handsome stranger.


156
00:10:57.966 --> 00:11:00.401
But you seem a little
too old to have


157
00:11:00.434 --> 00:11:02.937
parents who are on psychedelics.

158
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:04.005
Love you.

159
00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:05.006
I love you.

160
00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.374
Miss you.

161
00:11:06.407 --> 00:11:07.375
I'm going to miss you.

162
00:11:07.408 --> 00:11:08.342
I'll be back soon.

163
00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.310
OK.

164
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.848
Drive safe.

165
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.716
Don't worry.

166
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.056
I'm Ted.

167
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:23.792
I'm Meredith.

168
00:11:23.825 --> 00:11:25.093
Good to meet you, Meredith.

169
00:11:25.126 --> 00:11:26.527
Nice to meet you, too.

170
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.196
That was my mother's name.

171
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.230
You're kidding.

172
00:11:29.263 --> 00:11:30.264
I wish I was.

173
00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:32.100
It'd make for a better story.

174
00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:33.935
It's my grandmother's name, too.

175
00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:36.871
But I don't really
think it suits me.


176
00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.039
Where's this equipment?

177
00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:39.774
In the trunk. Shall we?

178
00:11:39.808 --> 00:11:40.809
We shall.

179
00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:41.776
Lead the way.

180
00:11:56.624 --> 00:11:57.591
Damn.

181
00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:58.592
Do you need help?

182
00:11:58.626 --> 00:12:00.261
No, thanks.

183
00:12:00.294 --> 00:12:03.464
Got to figure out how to do all
this stuff on my own with this.


184
00:12:03.497 --> 00:12:05.566
Damn, I always forget
which one it is.


185
00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:08.169
It's usually the
same one as the door.


186
00:12:08.202 --> 00:12:09.303
You're correct.

187
00:12:09.337 --> 00:12:11.139
I swear if my head
wasn't attached,


188
00:12:11.172 --> 00:12:13.741
it'd fall off and
roll down a hill.


189
00:12:20.148 --> 00:12:21.749
Actually, what time is it?

190
00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:23.617
Noon-ish?

191
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:26.020
About, yeah.

192
00:12:26.054 --> 00:12:27.989
Got a phone call in a
half hour I totally forgot


193
00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:30.191
about, an important one.

194
00:12:30.224 --> 00:12:31.993
OK, but what about your friend?

195
00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:34.295
It's a lot of equipment, and
I live about 20 minutes away.


196
00:12:34.328 --> 00:12:36.497
Can't risk missing it.

197
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.533
Call's with that
law firm in Miami.


198
00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:41.702
Oh.

199
00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:43.804
Well, I guess you
better get going then.


200
00:12:43.838 --> 00:12:44.772
At least you tried.

201
00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.007
Yeah.

202
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.443
Hey, if you end up
needing help later,


203
00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:54.382
you could just knock on my
sorority door and ask for me.


204
00:12:54.415 --> 00:12:56.350
I'm just going grocery
shopping right now, so I'll


205
00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:57.986
be back in about an hour or so.

206
00:12:58.019 --> 00:12:59.453
Sounds like a date.

207
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.955
See you soon, I hope.

208
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.124
Yeah, I hope so.

209
00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:04.192
Bye.

210
00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:09.563
Delta, phi, sigma!

211
00:13:09.597 --> 00:13:11.032
Woo!

212
00:13:28.116 --> 00:13:30.484
Hey, Kelly!

213
00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.153
Hi there.

214
00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.988
I'm looking for the
Bradford Building.


215
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.523
Just transferred in
from Georgia State.


216
00:13:35.556 --> 00:13:36.590
Help me out?

217
00:13:36.624 --> 00:13:37.992
Hey Kelly, come on. Let's go!

218
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:38.993
What building?

219
00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.094
Bradford.

220
00:13:40.128 --> 00:13:41.362
Could also be called
Bradford Hall?


221
00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:42.663
I don't know. I've heard both.

222
00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:44.865
Kelly, move it or lose it.

223
00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:47.235
I'm sorry, I haven't
heard of that.


224
00:13:47.268 --> 00:13:48.402
Must not be a law student.

225
00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:49.938
I'm coming in to
teach this semester.


226
00:13:49.971 --> 00:13:51.772
Hey, we got cold
beers waiting, babe.


227
00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:52.773
What's your major?

228
00:13:52.806 --> 00:13:53.774
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:53.807 --> 00:13:54.842
Let's go.

230
00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:55.776
What's your major?

231
00:13:55.809 --> 00:13:56.911
Let's go.

232
00:13:56.945 --> 00:13:58.212
I'm sorry, we have a wedding.

233
00:13:58.246 --> 00:13:59.180
Yeah, come on.

234
00:13:59.213 --> 00:14:00.348
OK.

235
00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.783
Let's go.

236
00:14:02.816 --> 00:14:05.053
Who the hell was that guy?

237
00:14:24.338 --> 00:14:25.373
Fuck!

238
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:28.576
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

239
00:15:09.217 --> 00:15:11.019
Every time you
ask me to do this,


240
00:15:11.052 --> 00:15:12.620
you promise me
it's the last time.


241
00:15:12.653 --> 00:15:14.455
And it never is.

242
00:15:14.488 --> 00:15:16.957
It's like you forget that I
have to take care of Molly, too.


243
00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:20.928
I barely make enough to support
one child, let alone two.


244
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:22.630
Are you hearing me?

245
00:15:22.663 --> 00:15:23.864
It's not OK!

246
00:15:30.838 --> 00:15:32.073
How about 500?

247
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.813
I ate out of a supermarket
trash can yesterday.


248
00:15:39.847 --> 00:15:41.949
You didn't eat out
of a trash can.


249
00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:43.217
I know you.

250
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:44.485
You'd rather starve than
do anything like that.


251
00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:46.287
Fine.

252
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.790
I've been reduced to eating
expired cans of beans.


253
00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:53.527
Followed by the handle of vodka
you somehow manage to pay for.


254
00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:55.729
This isn't a life, Ted.

255
00:15:55.763 --> 00:15:58.832
I don't know why you put
yourself through this.


256
00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:00.801
You can turn yourself in
and change it, you know it.


257
00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:02.703
Right now.

258
00:16:02.736 --> 00:16:04.138
I'm not going back to prison.

259
00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.839
That's not a life.

260
00:16:05.873 --> 00:16:07.475
Anyway, I don't need to go back.

261
00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:11.345
Innocent people
don't go to prison.


262
00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:14.048
You know I'm innocent.

263
00:16:14.082 --> 00:16:15.616
I'm not doing this again.

264
00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:23.091
Not doing what again,
profiting off dead girls?


265
00:16:24.292 --> 00:16:28.329
I didn't call the
police hotline on you.


266
00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:31.065
Then, who did?

267
00:16:31.099 --> 00:16:36.036
Who knows me well enough to give
them all the details they have?


268
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.139
Just let me know where to send
the fucking Western Union.


269
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.044
How much are you sending me?

270
00:16:44.078 --> 00:16:46.747
$1,000, and that is all
I can afford right now.


271
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.383
Not a single cent more.

272
00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:51.885
Please don't ask
me for money again.


273
00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:55.123
That'll help a ton. Thank you.

274
00:16:55.156 --> 00:16:57.125
You can send it
to the supermarket


275
00:16:57.158 --> 00:16:59.360
at the corner of
Park and Jefferson Street


276
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:00.461
in Tallahassee.

277
00:17:03.797 --> 00:17:05.733
I can't do this anymore.

278
00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:07.468
I miss Seattle.

279
00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:12.640
Liz?

280
00:17:12.673 --> 00:17:14.275
I'm here.

281
00:17:14.308 --> 00:17:16.610
I'll call you back when I
have the confirmation number.


282
00:17:16.644 --> 00:17:18.879
See that thing on the news?

283
00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:20.448
When people said
they thought I was


284
00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:23.050
scarier than the shark in Jaws?

285
00:17:26.987 --> 00:17:29.257
Liz?

286
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.191
Fuck!

287
00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:58.011
Yeah.

288
00:18:58.045 --> 00:18:59.747
But it might just be the girls.

289
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.848
I don't know.

290
00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:02.716
Do you think it's our sorority?

291
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.585
Do you think they just
hate all Delta Phi?


292
00:19:04.618 --> 00:19:05.653
Yeah, absolutely.

293
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:06.720
100%.

294
00:19:06.754 --> 00:19:07.988
That could totally be it.

295
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.923
So that was disgusting.

296
00:19:09.957 --> 00:19:11.725
It smells better in
here, that's for sure.


297
00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:14.895
Well, someone put god knows
what in the back of the freezer


298
00:19:14.928 --> 00:19:16.364
after it had already spoiled.

299
00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:17.398
Oh, man.

300
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:18.532
Well, no worries.

301
00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:20.033
It's all cleaned up.

302
00:19:20.067 --> 00:19:22.236
I just didn't want whatever
died in there haunting us.


303
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.571
Well, what do you think it was?

304
00:19:23.604 --> 00:19:25.105
Don't know, but it had eyes.

305
00:19:25.138 --> 00:19:26.774
Ew. God.

306
00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:28.242
No, gross.

307
00:20:01.942 --> 00:20:04.912
My soda smells like the
dead thing from the freezer.


308
00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:08.449
So wash the cans!

309
00:20:08.482 --> 00:20:10.351
I'm not washing the
stupid soda cans.


310
00:20:17.691 --> 00:20:18.892
Oh, god.

311
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:19.827
Ugh.

312
00:20:38.379 --> 00:20:41.782
So have you gotten
your schedule yet?


313
00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:43.951
I did get it earlier.

314
00:20:43.984 --> 00:20:45.018
Let me guess.

315
00:20:45.052 --> 00:20:46.320
You have Mr. Reeves
for calculus.


316
00:20:48.656 --> 00:20:52.693
I left it in my drawer,
but I'll check later.


317
00:20:52.726 --> 00:20:55.929
They did actually
double prices for books.


318
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.130
Shit.

319
00:20:57.164 --> 00:20:58.666
Are you really
surprised, though?


320
00:20:58.699 --> 00:20:59.933
Money's tight back home.

321
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.201
I know.

322
00:21:01.234 --> 00:21:03.337
Yeah, and suddenly
shipping prices going up.


323
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:06.440
Which, I don't know.
It seems shady to me.


324
00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:09.610
Well, I don't have
enough cash for books.


325
00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:11.645
Well, just buy what you can
now and borrow the rest.


326
00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:15.115
That's what I'm going to do.

327
00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:17.618
I borrow books every time
I have to go to class.


328
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.987
It only makes sense.

329
00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:26.627
Just breathe, OK?

330
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.962
How do I get my hair
to look like that?


331
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.330
Your hair looks great.

332
00:21:30.364 --> 00:21:31.532
Gray?

333
00:21:31.565 --> 00:21:33.367
Great.

334
00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:34.535
Yeah, thanks a lot, Vic.

335
00:21:34.568 --> 00:21:35.969
I already don't feel well.

336
00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:37.371
Where are you going?

337
00:21:37.405 --> 00:21:38.338
Mind your business.

338
00:21:42.576 --> 00:21:46.414
So my Christmas totally sucked.

339
00:21:46.447 --> 00:21:47.848
How about yours?

340
00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:49.883
I gained five pounds.

341
00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:52.319
Then, I spent New
Years losing it.


342
00:21:53.787 --> 00:21:56.356
Robert took me to go
see Saturday Night


343
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.691
Fever on Christmas Eve.

344
00:21:57.725 --> 00:21:58.892
I liked that movie.

345
00:21:58.926 --> 00:22:01.194
And then, he dumped me.

346
00:22:01.228 --> 00:22:03.263
Oh wait, weren't you going
to do the same thing to him?


347
00:22:03.296 --> 00:22:04.364
Yeah.

348
00:22:04.398 --> 00:22:06.667
On my terms, not his.

349
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.002
At least I got a free
movie ticket out of it.


350
00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:11.705
He snuck in to Close Encounters
once the damage was done.


351
00:22:11.739 --> 00:22:13.541
OK, so it didn't
totally suck then.


352
00:22:13.574 --> 00:22:16.677
Girault is hot, so no.

353
00:22:21.582 --> 00:22:24.384
All right, a few concerns.

354
00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:27.054
I heard that somebody
is leaving the hallway


355
00:22:27.087 --> 00:22:29.757
light on in the second
floor, and some of you


356
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.725
are having difficulty sleeping.

357
00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:35.596
Now, I don't know who's doing
it and I don't really care.


358
00:22:35.629 --> 00:22:37.698
But could you please just not?

359
00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:39.399
Thank you in advance.

360
00:22:39.433 --> 00:22:42.436
Doesn't it make more sense
if the person who finds


361
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.871
the light on just turns it off?

362
00:22:43.904 --> 00:22:45.205
Maybe.

363
00:22:45.238 --> 00:22:46.874
But when you're up till

364
00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:49.977
doing homework-- just turn
the damn light off, OK?


365
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.479
Moving on.

366
00:22:51.512 --> 00:22:53.981
All right, so I know
I shouldn't have


367
00:22:54.014 --> 00:22:56.550
to remind you that there
are no boys allowed


368
00:22:56.584 --> 00:22:58.986
on the second floor.

369
00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:01.655
I don't care if he's your
boyfriend that you just


370
00:23:01.689 --> 00:23:03.323
eloped with, and now
he's your husband.


371
00:23:03.356 --> 00:23:05.993
OK, he's still not allowed
on the second floor.


372
00:23:06.026 --> 00:23:08.729
That's the sorority's
rules, not mine.


373
00:23:08.762 --> 00:23:11.231
So no sugar daddies, either.

374
00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:15.402
No sugar daddies, either.

375
00:23:15.435 --> 00:23:17.471
Then, how's Candace
supposed to pay her tuition?


376
00:23:17.505 --> 00:23:18.572
Ooh.

377
00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:19.940
Hard labor.

378
00:23:19.973 --> 00:23:21.809
Thank you.

379
00:23:21.842 --> 00:23:23.911
Nice of you to join us, Candace.

380
00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:25.946
It's the weekend.

381
00:23:25.979 --> 00:23:27.147
All right, then.

382
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.116
I guess that's everything.

383
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:31.752
Enjoy the rest of your Saturday.

384
00:23:40.994 --> 00:23:42.029
That's so good.

385
00:23:42.062 --> 00:23:43.531
It's good?

386
00:23:43.564 --> 00:23:46.133
Yeah, once you get over
the whole texture thing.


387
00:23:52.005 --> 00:23:54.642
Yeah, let me just change my
clothes and I'll come with you.


388
00:23:54.675 --> 00:23:55.643
All right, bye.

389
00:24:15.896 --> 00:24:18.666
State Book Depository,
this is Alex.


390
00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:21.234
I was calling to see if you had
a few textbooks in, hopefully


391
00:24:21.268 --> 00:24:22.836
used.

392
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.672
Leave me your name and number,
and I can check and call you


393
00:24:24.705 --> 00:24:26.473
right back.

394
00:24:26.506 --> 00:24:29.677
I'm kind of in the
weeds right now.


395
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.744
OK, no worries.

396
00:24:30.778 --> 00:24:32.680
Just let me know
when you're ready.


397
00:24:32.713 --> 00:24:37.017
All right, shoot.

398
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.219
Darlene Collins.

399
00:24:39.252 --> 00:24:41.555
I'm at the Delta
Phi Sigma house.


400
00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:47.928
The number is KL5-5050.

401
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:50.363
Can you repeat the last
part of that number again?


402
00:24:50.397 --> 00:24:54.434
Sure. It's 5050.

403
00:24:54.467 --> 00:24:56.570
Thank you.

404
00:24:56.604 --> 00:24:58.338
What are you looking for?

405
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:05.112
It's International Trade
Law, Intellectual Property,


406
00:25:05.145 --> 00:25:11.051
Calculus 301, Linguistics,
and Advanced Accounting.


407
00:25:11.084 --> 00:25:14.554
Advanced Accounting.

408
00:25:14.588 --> 00:25:16.256
We'll call you back as
soon as we have something.


409
00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:17.357
Thanks.

410
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.525
Have a great weekend.

411
00:25:18.558 --> 00:25:20.728
OK, bye-bye.

412
00:25:47.788 --> 00:25:49.222
Yeah, it was kind of weird.

413
00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:50.557
Not like her at all.

414
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.260
Yeah, she left before
the meeting happened.


415
00:25:53.293 --> 00:25:55.395
She's never does that.

416
00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:56.596
No, never.

417
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:58.966
We should really
see if she's OK.


418
00:25:58.999 --> 00:26:00.433
Yeah, let's go check on her.

419
00:26:11.044 --> 00:26:14.948
Sonia, what's up?

420
00:26:14.982 --> 00:26:16.917
I don't know.

421
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.253
Vibes are off in here.

422
00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:23.256
Well, you can't be homesick
before the semester begins.


423
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.625
House rules.

424
00:26:25.659 --> 00:26:28.261
I'm not homesick.

425
00:26:28.295 --> 00:26:30.898
Place just feels strange.

426
00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:44.311
You're wasting your
time with the bookstore.


427
00:26:44.344 --> 00:26:45.445
I already called.

428
00:26:45.478 --> 00:26:46.980
Everything used is sold out.

429
00:26:47.014 --> 00:26:48.181
Yeah.

430
00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:49.216
But I mean, doesn't matter.

431
00:26:49.249 --> 00:26:50.951
We're kind of all
in the same boat.


432
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:53.954
It's shitty.

433
00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:56.323
So what do we do?

434
00:26:56.356 --> 00:26:57.324
I don't know.

435
00:26:57.357 --> 00:26:58.959
Get a job?

436
00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:00.861
Maybe we could talk to
Candace and see if they're


437
00:27:00.894 --> 00:27:04.131
hiring down the street.

438
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:05.899
I just feel like trying
to balance schoolwork


439
00:27:05.933 --> 00:27:07.367
and a job would be too much.

440
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.002
Remember what happened to Donna?

441
00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:11.038
OK, well we're going to go
to Shaker's later tonight


442
00:27:11.071 --> 00:27:14.541
if you want to de-stress.

443
00:27:14.574 --> 00:27:15.909
Yeah.

444
00:27:15.943 --> 00:27:17.577
Probably shouldn't
spend money on drinks


445
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.814
if I can't even afford
my books, though.


446
00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:22.482
No, thanks.

447
00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:25.352
OK, then I'll just never
speak to you again.


448
00:27:25.385 --> 00:27:27.254
Yeah right, until you
need to borrow my car.


449
00:27:30.724 --> 00:27:31.792
Have fun.

450
00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:36.730
Hey.

451
00:27:36.764 --> 00:27:39.532
Hey.

452
00:28:01.989 --> 00:28:04.291
Bradford Building
or Bradford Hall?


453
00:28:04.324 --> 00:28:05.692
I don't think I've
ever heard of it.


454
00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:07.027
Why?

455
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.295
Guy driving around earlier
was looking for it.


456
00:28:08.328 --> 00:28:09.763
He said he's about
to start teaching


457
00:28:09.797 --> 00:28:10.931
law classes this semester.

458
00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:16.804
He probably had it mixed
up with another building.


459
00:28:16.837 --> 00:28:18.939
Maybe.

460
00:28:18.972 --> 00:28:22.943
Or he was probably looking
for A&amp;M.


461
00:28:22.976 --> 00:28:24.778
What did he drive?

462
00:28:24.812 --> 00:28:25.813
Volkswagen Beetle.

463
00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:56.309
Hey, April?
Hi.


464
00:28:56.343 --> 00:28:58.645
Can you unzip me?

465
00:33:12.965 --> 00:33:17.337
Did someone get a
dog for Christmas?


466
00:33:58.245 --> 00:33:59.612
No kidding.

467
00:33:59.646 --> 00:34:01.047
You think I look like Han Solo?

468
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.451
I do.

469
00:34:04.484 --> 00:34:07.320
In fact, I wish Carla told
me that the first time you


470
00:34:07.354 --> 00:34:08.555
asked me out.

471
00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:10.557
And I probably would
have said yes, too.


472
00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.791
That was yesterday.

473
00:34:11.824 --> 00:34:13.092
I know.

474
00:34:13.126 --> 00:34:14.927
But life's too short
to make bad decisions.


475
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:17.397
You know, my hair actually
used to look more like Chewie.


476
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:18.565
What?

477
00:34:18.598 --> 00:34:20.233
Yeah, but my coach
made me cut my hair


478
00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:22.935
because he said I was getting
sweat on all the other players.


479
00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.471
How does he know it was you?

480
00:34:24.504 --> 00:34:25.905
Because when I would do a layup.

481
00:34:25.938 --> 00:34:27.140
Yeah.

482
00:34:27.174 --> 00:34:29.609
It would sound like this.

483
00:34:31.178 --> 00:34:37.284
Do it
again, do it again.


484
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.855
Double whiskey on the rocks.

485
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:43.856
Thank you.

486
00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:44.924
Right on time.

487
00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:46.459
Saw you come in.

488
00:34:46.493 --> 00:34:47.694
Keep a tab open?

489
00:34:47.727 --> 00:34:48.761
We'll see.

490
00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:49.862
Let me know. Enjoy.

491
00:34:49.896 --> 00:34:50.963
Yeah!

492
00:34:50.997 --> 00:34:51.864
This game is off the hook.

493
00:34:51.898 --> 00:34:52.865
Dynamite.

494
00:34:52.899 --> 00:34:53.833
Woo!

495
00:34:56.169 --> 00:34:58.438
Not a football fan?

496
00:34:58.471 --> 00:35:00.973
Not the Cowboys or
Broncos, that's for sure.


497
00:35:01.007 --> 00:35:02.642
Let me guess.

498
00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:03.976
Not a Dolphins fan.

499
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.478
Too obvious.

500
00:35:05.512 --> 00:35:08.648
You're not someone who wears
things like that honestly.


501
00:35:08.681 --> 00:35:09.816
Oh, really?

502
00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:11.684
I know your type.

503
00:35:11.718 --> 00:35:15.054
You're not guarded, but you're
not an open book either.


504
00:35:15.087 --> 00:35:18.024
Something of an enigma
to the unwashed masses.


505
00:35:18.057 --> 00:35:20.126
I'm a modern woman.

506
00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:24.497
A modern woman who's
an Atlanta Falcons fan.


507
00:35:24.531 --> 00:35:26.366
How did you know?

508
00:35:26.399 --> 00:35:27.567
Accent.

509
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.469
It's slight like
you try to lose it,


510
00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:31.638
but I can still pick up
a syllable or two there.


511
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:33.906
Which ones?

512
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.075
The oh sound.

513
00:35:36.108 --> 00:35:38.144
You used to pronounce
them downward.


514
00:35:38.177 --> 00:35:40.580
But you spent all four
years of high school


515
00:35:40.613 --> 00:35:42.882
taking theater classes,
trying to sound more


516
00:35:42.915 --> 00:35:45.318
like you're from the Midwest.

517
00:35:45.352 --> 00:35:46.853
Phonetics.

518
00:35:46.886 --> 00:35:49.856
I guess you figured that
I'm a grad student of speech


519
00:35:49.889 --> 00:35:51.190
and communications.

520
00:35:51.224 --> 00:35:53.760
You're correct.

521
00:35:53.793 --> 00:35:56.329
What's your name, smartass?

522
00:35:56.363 --> 00:35:57.597
It's Ted.

523
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.599
How about you?

524
00:35:59.632 --> 00:36:01.167
I'm Nancy.

525
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.736
Sorry to hear the
Pistols broke up, Nancy.


526
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.005
Yeah,
it's a real bummer.


527
00:36:06.038 --> 00:36:07.574
But I'll live.

528
00:36:07.607 --> 00:36:09.342
Are you a music fan?

529
00:36:09.376 --> 00:36:11.378
When it's appropriate.

530
00:36:11.411 --> 00:36:14.381
Yeah, I'm more of a Clash
fan myself over the Pistols.


531
00:36:14.414 --> 00:36:15.415
They comb their hair.

532
00:36:15.448 --> 00:36:17.250
Yeah, baby, yeah!

533
00:36:17.284 --> 00:36:18.418
See?

534
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:21.754
The unwashed masses agree.

535
00:36:21.788 --> 00:36:23.590
Didn't peg you as a punker, Ted.

536
00:36:23.623 --> 00:36:24.857
I'm not.

537
00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:26.793
When I'm not listening
to Meet the Press,


538
00:36:26.826 --> 00:36:28.695
I keep it on a
classical station.


539
00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:29.796
Calms my nerves.

540
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:31.398
A little bit of jazz
on the weekends,


541
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:34.200
if I feel like letting loose.

542
00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:36.135
Hey, it's Saturday.

543
00:36:36.168 --> 00:36:37.370
Exactly.

544
00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:38.705
Thinking of hitting
The Junction later,


545
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:40.573
if you'd like to tag along.

546
00:36:40.607 --> 00:36:43.810
Oh, I don't tag along.

547
00:36:43.843 --> 00:36:45.712
You don't.

548
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:47.814
Just said I'm a Clash
fan, stuff like that.


549
00:36:47.847 --> 00:36:48.881
I don't get jazz.

550
00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:50.216
Not really my cup of tea.

551
00:36:50.249 --> 00:36:51.584
What's there not to get?

552
00:36:51.618 --> 00:36:54.053
Complex rhythms, time
changes, actual musicianship.


553
00:36:54.086 --> 00:36:56.055
Not a bunch of gawky
teenagers screaming


554
00:36:56.088 --> 00:36:57.790
at the top of their
lungs over three chords


555
00:36:57.824 --> 00:36:59.392
and a pint about the Queen.

556
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:00.927
It wasn't an insult, Ted.

557
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.861
Calm down.

558
00:37:05.164 --> 00:37:06.833
We can go someplace else, then.

559
00:37:10.202 --> 00:37:11.438
No, thank you.

560
00:37:11.471 --> 00:37:12.939
I have an early morning.

561
00:37:12.972 --> 00:37:15.141
But I appreciate the company.

562
00:37:15.174 --> 00:37:16.142
You fucking whore.

563
00:37:16.175 --> 00:37:17.176
Bitch.

564
00:37:17.209 --> 00:37:18.611
Excuse me?

565
00:37:18.645 --> 00:37:19.712
Yeah, baby, yeah!

566
00:37:23.182 --> 00:37:24.351
Get me another.

567
00:37:24.384 --> 00:37:26.486
I think you need to
slow it down a bit.


568
00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:27.654
No.

569
00:37:27.687 --> 00:37:30.357
What I need is another.

570
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:35.462
Cool off, then you
can have another.


571
00:37:35.495 --> 00:37:36.463
How much do I owe you?

572
00:37:36.496 --> 00:37:37.864
$3.50.

573
00:37:37.897 --> 00:37:40.333
Keep the change.

574
00:37:48.908 --> 00:37:50.643
She's a regular.

575
00:37:50.677 --> 00:37:53.880
I keep an eye on my regulars.

576
00:37:53.913 --> 00:37:55.482
Understood?

577
00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:28.548
Fuck me.

578
00:39:41.253 --> 00:39:43.055
Malt liquor.

579
00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:44.491
You cool down yet?

580
00:39:44.524 --> 00:39:45.958
Always was.

581
00:39:45.992 --> 00:39:48.094
You're not going to serve me?

582
00:39:48.127 --> 00:39:50.162
I'm not sure.

583
00:39:50.196 --> 00:39:52.565
As a customer who's not
currently intoxicated,


584
00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:55.434
I believe that's what
you're paid to do.


585
00:40:09.348 --> 00:40:12.118
Stick to yourself.

586
00:40:12.151 --> 00:40:14.420
Scout's honor.

587
00:40:29.168 --> 00:40:31.370
Oh my god, I know.

588
00:40:31.403 --> 00:40:34.974
I would do anything for him.

589
00:40:35.007 --> 00:40:36.709
I just love him so much.

590
00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:42.181
I'll have a drink.

591
00:40:42.214 --> 00:40:44.517
All you can eat, open bar.

592
00:40:44.551 --> 00:40:46.018
Do they ever run out of food?

593
00:40:46.052 --> 00:40:47.820
No girl, it's huge.

594
00:40:47.854 --> 00:40:49.288
They'll never run out.

595
00:40:49.321 --> 00:40:51.290
Maybe they helicopter
the food in if there's


596
00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:52.224
a party or something.

597
00:40:52.258 --> 00:40:53.960
Yeah.

598
00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:56.829
Mayday mayday, we need 10 tons
of shrimp to the SS Shark Bait.


599
00:40:56.863 --> 00:40:57.897
Exactly.

600
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.834
This is awkward.

601
00:41:01.868 --> 00:41:03.002
Yeah.

602
00:41:03.035 --> 00:41:05.171
Does he ever blink?

603
00:41:05.204 --> 00:41:07.039
OK, so drinks.

604
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:08.040
Yeah.

605
00:41:08.074 --> 00:41:09.175
Perfect.

606
00:41:09.208 --> 00:41:10.309
Chocolate martini,
vodka cranberry.


607
00:41:10.342 --> 00:41:11.243
Yes, extra sweet.

608
00:41:11.277 --> 00:41:12.244
That's it.

609
00:41:12.278 --> 00:41:13.245
Got it.

610
00:41:13.279 --> 00:41:14.346
OK.

611
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.381
And a job application.

612
00:41:15.414 --> 00:41:16.983
No, you're going to
do that tomorrow.


613
00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:18.685
Tonight, you're
going to get drunk.


614
00:41:18.718 --> 00:41:20.987
Ooh, OK.

615
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.354
I hope you're ready.

616
00:41:22.388 --> 00:41:23.522
You know she's crazy.

617
00:41:23.556 --> 00:41:24.456
I know.

618
00:41:29.095 --> 00:41:31.998
He is not letting up, either.

619
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:33.332
Jesus.

620
00:41:38.537 --> 00:41:40.873
Oh, my god.

621
00:41:40.907 --> 00:41:41.941
I don't know.

622
00:41:44.744 --> 00:41:47.413
So I talked to the bartender.

623
00:41:47.446 --> 00:41:49.215
The hiring manager
is coming tomorrow.


624
00:41:49.248 --> 00:41:50.583
So you can go in then.

625
00:41:50.617 --> 00:41:52.118
Also, just tell them
Brenda sent you.


626
00:41:52.151 --> 00:41:53.185
Thank you.

627
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:54.186
Look at that.

628
00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.287
This is good.

629
00:41:55.321 --> 00:41:57.089
I got you.

630
00:41:57.123 --> 00:41:58.257
Now, we definitely need drinks.

631
00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.291
Yeah.

632
00:42:00.326 --> 00:42:01.293
Oh, sorry.

633
00:42:01.327 --> 00:42:02.294
Chocolate martini?

634
00:42:02.328 --> 00:42:03.295
Oh, right here.

635
00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:04.363
Yes. Thank you.

636
00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:05.397
And vodka cran.

637
00:42:05.431 --> 00:42:06.866
Thank you.
Thank you.


638
00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.300
Yeah, enjoy.

639
00:42:08.334 --> 00:42:09.602
No.

640
00:42:09.636 --> 00:42:11.270
You have an interview
tomorrow, so I'm going


641
00:42:11.303 --> 00:42:12.805
to help you with that hangover.

642
00:42:12.839 --> 00:42:14.440
Thanks, mom.

643
00:42:14.473 --> 00:42:15.541
I met your mom.

644
00:42:15.574 --> 00:42:16.475
She's pretty cool.

645
00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:20.379
Just saying.

646
00:42:26.452 --> 00:42:28.420
I am really not even
thirsty anymore.


647
00:42:28.454 --> 00:42:29.388
OK.

648
00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:30.389
Yeah.

649
00:42:30.422 --> 00:42:31.490
Let's just--

650
00:42:31.523 --> 00:42:33.760
Yeah, we can go somewhere else.

651
00:42:41.868 --> 00:42:44.270
Want to dance?

652
00:42:44.303 --> 00:42:45.604
What?

653
00:42:45.638 --> 00:42:46.973
I said, want to dance?

654
00:42:49.676 --> 00:42:52.278
Don't you like the song?

655
00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:53.412
It's OK, I guess.

656
00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:56.015
Well, let's go.

657
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:25.812
Help me.

658
00:43:25.845 --> 00:43:27.714
Can we get some help, please?

659
00:43:27.747 --> 00:43:29.648
Excuse me.

660
00:43:29.682 --> 00:43:30.783
Come on, Fred Astaire.

661
00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:31.984
I've been watching
you all night.


662
00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:50.502
What a rube!

663
00:43:50.536 --> 00:43:51.537
You OK there, grandpa?

664
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:55.041
You need help walking, too?

665
00:43:55.074 --> 00:43:56.675
Hey, take it easy, fella.

666
00:43:56.709 --> 00:43:57.810
That's it.

667
00:43:57.844 --> 00:44:00.512
Left, right, left, right.

668
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:33.512
Thank you.

669
00:44:33.545 --> 00:44:35.181
At the tone, please
say your name.


670
00:44:36.215 --> 00:44:38.350
Ted.

671
00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:03.575
Thank you.

672
00:45:03.609 --> 00:45:05.144
At the tone, please
say your name.


673
00:45:06.178 --> 00:45:08.247
It's Ted.

674
00:45:28.467 --> 00:45:30.669
Hello?

675
00:45:30.702 --> 00:45:31.971
Thank you.

676
00:45:32.004 --> 00:45:33.672
At the tone, please
say your name.


677
00:45:34.941 --> 00:45:38.777
My name is Ted.

678
00:45:42.849 --> 00:45:45.117
Answer the phone.

679
00:45:47.286 --> 00:45:49.922
Answer the
fucking phone line!


680
00:45:49.956 --> 00:45:50.990
Fuck!

681
00:47:21.247 --> 00:47:27.119
When the mind is
free, a ghost is closer to me.


682
00:47:27.153 --> 00:47:32.124
And it is just in
time, time to realize.


683
00:47:36.095 --> 00:47:38.097
Now, I'm holding on.

684
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:42.068
My arms are wrapped around you.

685
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:45.537
And the spirits are so high.

686
00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:50.042
Can't let this die.

687
00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:53.479
It's not what people say.

688
00:47:53.512 --> 00:47:57.483
It's more what they may do.

689
00:47:57.516 --> 00:48:01.420
'Cause words are often wrong.

690
00:48:01.453 --> 00:48:03.322
Actions can't be undone.

691
00:48:16.102 --> 00:48:17.436
Whoa, whoa.

692
00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:18.737
Relax.

693
00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:20.672
You're not at an
Aerosmith concert.


694
00:48:20.706 --> 00:48:24.276
Sweet emotions.

695
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:25.444
Wait, wait.

696
00:48:25.477 --> 00:48:27.179
Terrible cover, Lori.

697
00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:31.683
Not as terrible as that
creepy guy's dance moves.


698
00:48:31.717 --> 00:48:32.684
Did you see him?

699
00:48:32.718 --> 00:48:33.685
No.

700
00:48:33.719 --> 00:48:34.686
Shit!

701
00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:39.025
You're going to wake
up the whole house.


702
00:48:39.058 --> 00:48:41.193
Lori can't control her limits.

703
00:48:41.227 --> 00:48:42.594
Or her--

704
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:45.264
Shh!

705
00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:46.999
Shit, sorry.

706
00:48:47.033 --> 00:48:48.100
Oh, gosh.

707
00:48:48.134 --> 00:48:50.036
And now, I'm awake.

708
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:52.171
Three fraternity
parties, and your system


709
00:48:52.204 --> 00:48:55.441
will get used to drinking again.

710
00:48:55.474 --> 00:48:56.775
That's no shit.

711
00:48:56.808 --> 00:48:59.678
They spike the booze
at all those things.


712
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:01.380
You would know.

713
00:49:01.413 --> 00:49:02.881
Shh!

714
00:49:05.217 --> 00:49:07.786
And you look so pretty.

715
00:49:10.356 --> 00:49:13.292
OK, we can do this.

716
00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:14.560
Party pooper.

717
00:52:37.896 --> 00:52:41.667
Stop.

718
00:52:46.872 --> 00:52:48.774
Fuck!

719
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.866
I want my mom.

720
00:53:23.975 --> 00:53:26.278
Ow!

721
00:54:18.564 --> 00:54:21.700
What are you doing?

722
00:54:21.733 --> 00:54:24.035
What
are you doing in here?


723
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:26.872
What are
you doing in here?


724
00:54:26.905 --> 00:54:30.308
No, no.

725
00:54:49.928 --> 00:54:50.896
Harlan?

726
00:54:59.538 --> 00:55:01.640
What are you--

727
00:55:45.484 --> 00:55:46.752
Did you see that?

728
00:55:46.785 --> 00:55:47.886
Yeah.

729
00:55:47.919 --> 00:55:49.555
What's going on?

730
00:55:49.588 --> 00:55:50.689
I don't know.

731
00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:53.258
I just saw a guy run
down the hallway.


732
00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:54.626
What guy?

733
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.227
We're not even supposed
to have people up here.


734
00:55:56.261 --> 00:55:57.362
I know.

735
00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:58.564
Judy just said that
at the meeting.


736
00:55:58.597 --> 00:56:01.032
I don't have my boyfriend.

737
00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:02.568
Oh my god, oh my god.

738
00:56:02.601 --> 00:56:03.802
Oh my god, Lori.

739
00:56:03.835 --> 00:56:04.970
Lori?

740
00:56:05.003 --> 00:56:06.071
Oh, my god!

741
00:56:06.104 --> 00:56:08.373
Oh my god, call 911!

742
00:56:08.406 --> 00:56:09.808
Call 911!

743
00:56:09.841 --> 00:56:10.876
Oh my god, Lori.

744
00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:12.711
Lori? Lori?

745
00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:14.546
Oh, my god.

746
00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.914
Call 911!

747
00:56:15.947 --> 00:56:16.848
Lori.

748
00:58:28.914 --> 00:58:31.783
Police officer attached
to the juvenile division.


749
00:58:31.817 --> 00:58:33.952
I'm on my way to the
local junior high school


750
00:58:33.985 --> 00:58:37.022
to talk to a group
of young people.


751
00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:39.090
That looks innocent
enough, doesn't it?


752
00:58:39.124 --> 00:58:40.892
Lots of young people hitchhike.

753
00:58:40.926 --> 00:58:43.862
Seems like a good way to get
from one place to another.


754
00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:45.864
But sometimes, there
are dangers involved


755
00:58:45.897 --> 00:58:46.998
that never meets the eye.

756
00:58:50.135 --> 00:58:52.203
Let's take the case
of Jimmy Barnes.


757
00:58:52.237 --> 00:58:54.640
Jimmy played baseball
all afternoon,


758
00:58:54.673 --> 00:58:56.574
and he didn't feel
like walking home.


759
00:58:56.608 --> 00:58:59.444
So he decided to thumb a ride.

760
00:59:08.153 --> 00:59:10.555
He'd done it 100 times before.

761
00:59:10.588 --> 00:59:12.958
He didn't think anything
was unusual when a driver--


762
01:01:07.739 --> 01:01:10.475
And he hadn't enjoyed himself
so much in a long time.


763
01:01:14.645 --> 01:01:18.616
Then during lunch, Brown showed
him some pornographic pictures.


764
01:01:18.649 --> 01:01:20.518
Timmy knew he shouldn't
be interested--


765
01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:03.428
But payments were
expected in return.


766
01:04:00.745 --> 01:04:02.247
911, what's your emergency?

767
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.215
He left her for dead!

768
01:04:04.249 --> 01:04:05.216
Oh, god.

769
01:06:33.431 --> 01:06:37.202
A grisly scene tonight
as police arrive


770
01:06:37.235 --> 01:06:41.539
after a student found
fellow sorority sister Karla


771
01:06:41.572 --> 01:06:44.875
Coleman on the
floor in a doorway,


772
01:06:44.909 --> 01:06:48.346
lying in a pool of her
own blood, hardly alive.


773
01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:50.615
That is Karla Coleman
you see behind me,


774
01:06:50.648 --> 01:06:52.917
being ushered into
the ambulance.


775
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:56.187
It's been told that the
perpetrator entered the Delta


776
01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:58.589
Phi Sigma house
early this morning,


777
01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:00.925
and began to commit
unspeakable--


778
01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:03.628
Ladies, I'm Detective O'Connor.

779
01:07:03.661 --> 01:07:04.962
I'm here to help.

780
01:07:04.995 --> 01:07:07.532
I know this is very
difficult. I need


781
01:07:07.565 --> 01:07:10.735
to ask you not to
talk to each other


782
01:07:10.768 --> 01:07:13.771
until you've been interviewed
by either myself or one


783
01:07:13.804 --> 01:07:17.442
of the other officers, OK?

784
01:07:17.475 --> 01:07:19.110
Have you seen Meredith?

785
01:07:21.146 --> 01:07:22.880
Is she--

786
01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:25.316
I'm sorry.

787
01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:27.185
Can you tell us where
they're taking Karla?


788
01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:34.292
They said you may have seen
the suspect run past you when


789
01:07:34.325 --> 01:07:35.493
you entered the home.

790
01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:46.437
I know this is difficult.
Take a deep breath.


791
01:07:46.471 --> 01:07:48.839
It's OK.

792
01:07:48.873 --> 01:07:51.276
You spoke briefly with Ms. King.

793
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:52.943
She was hurt pretty bad.

794
01:07:52.977 --> 01:07:57.782
Did she say anything of any
relevance, who attacked her?


795
01:07:57.815 --> 01:08:00.785
Anything?

796
01:08:00.818 --> 01:08:02.653
All she said--

797
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:09.194
was all she saw was a black
mass.


798
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:14.932
Norma?

799
01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:16.033
Is it Norma?

800
01:08:19.136 --> 01:08:20.205
Take your time.

801
01:08:23.007 --> 01:08:26.811
Did you see his face?

802
01:08:26.844 --> 01:08:27.845
No.

803
01:08:31.549 --> 01:08:33.784
This doesn't fit his MO at all.

804
01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:38.122
I mean, the killings are not
like his profile in the least.


805
01:08:38.155 --> 01:08:40.057
Hey hey, hold up fellas.
Just a second.


806
01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.892
Is this the man?
Do you recognize this man?


807
01:08:41.926 --> 01:08:43.160
Is this the man who did it?

808
01:08:43.194 --> 01:08:44.629
Is this the man
who attacked you?


809
01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:47.031
We have a possible
gunshot wound.


810
01:08:47.064 --> 01:08:48.233
Jesus Christ.

811
01:08:57.074 --> 01:09:00.678
Excuse me detective,
can we get a statement?


812
01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:13.558
A sorority sister has
indicated...


813
01:09:16.026 --> 01:09:18.062
that a single male left

814
01:09:18.095 --> 01:09:21.198
the sorority house,
therefore indicating


815
01:09:21.232 --> 01:09:22.700
there's just one perpetrator.

816
01:09:22.733 --> 01:09:24.068
Do you have any idea--

817
01:09:27.572 --> 01:09:30.675
Fugitive.

818
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:34.579
He was escaped from
Glenwood Springs, Colorado


819
01:09:34.612 --> 01:09:36.781
this past December.

820
01:09:36.814 --> 01:09:40.285
Made his way East.

821
01:09:40.318 --> 01:09:44.789
He's linked in relation
to several dozen homicides


822
01:09:44.822 --> 01:09:46.724
in the Pacific
Northwest and the South.


823
01:09:51.762 --> 01:09:54.965
His name is Theodore
Robert Bundy.


824
01:09:54.999 --> 01:09:56.133
Ted Bundy.

825
01:09:58.603 --> 01:10:01.138
Theodore Robert Bundy.

826
01:10:01.171 --> 01:10:02.707
That is all.

827
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:07.278
I'm
telling you all I know.


828
01:10:07.312 --> 01:10:11.248
Are you hearing me?

829
01:10:11.282 --> 01:10:19.557
It's coming through, what I
think I'll be sure to believe.


830
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:24.595
I'm asking you to listen
up, maybe understand.


831
01:10:27.665 --> 01:10:31.268
It's all I have to give you.

832
01:10:31.302 --> 01:10:32.670
It's my helping hand.

833
01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:58.329
I'm leaving you all
I love that means everything.


834
01:10:58.363 --> 01:11:02.633
It's daring you to shout it out.

835
01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:06.371
Everyone should sing.

836
01:11:06.404 --> 01:11:10.207
Can you hear the
sound of my voice?


837
01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.944
Can you hear the
sound of my strumming?


838
01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:15.846
Are you hearing me?

839
01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.050
On the morning of
January 15, 1978.


840
01:11:20.084 --> 01:11:21.619
Yes, I do.

841
01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:24.288
And is that man in
the courtroom today?


842
01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:25.456
Yes, he is.

843
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:27.191
Would you point him
out for us, please?


844
01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.632
The advisory sentence
rendered by the jury


845
01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:38.168
does hereby impose the death
penalty upon the defendant


846
01:11:38.202 --> 01:11:40.137
Theodore Robert Bundy.

847
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.207
One of the more bizarre chapters
in recent American criminal


848
01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.675
history has come to an end.

849
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:47.412
The end for Ted Bundy,
a 42-year-old killer


850
01:11:47.445 --> 01:11:49.346
who left a trail of
at least 20 murders


851
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.248
from one end of the
country to the other,


852
01:11:51.281 --> 01:11:54.819
came in the electric chair
of Florida State Prison.


853
01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:20.778
Can you hear
the sound of my voice?


854
01:12:20.811 --> 01:12:24.582
Can you hear the
sound of my strumming?


855
01:12:24.615 --> 01:12:26.917
Can you hear the sound?

856
01:12:26.951 --> 01:12:28.352
I'm singing loud.

857
01:12:28.385 --> 01:12:32.523
Are you hearing me?

858
01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:36.727
Are you hearing me?

859
01:12:36.761 --> 01:12:40.030
Are you hearing me?

860
01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.966
Are you hearing me?

861
01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:45.603
Are you hearing me?

862
01:12:48.405 --> 01:12:51.709
Are you hearing me?

863
01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:55.880
Are you hearing me?

864
01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:59.216
Are you hearing me?
